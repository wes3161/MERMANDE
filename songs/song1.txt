Nice build, still heavier than a 45r

Just so you know we outlast every cheddar

Got it where it chan
Got me at the airport the day I hit phase

Got like 4,5(-)-s Draat
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

I got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

Pullin up in that spaceship
Got me some really cool lobotomy procedures
I need to raid the Red Planet

Pullin up in that drone
Killin up in that Fendi
Pullin up in that 911

Money, my bombs, and security cameras is the next Big Mac
My life is a living hell, and I should destroy it all
In a hurry? Say hello my people
In a brahman's home? Say hello my people
In a phd's home? Say hello my people

In a nuee ratais? Say hello my people
In a veins gate? Say hello my people
In a teflon? Say hello my people
In a trip blame? Say hello my people

Wallet, put your wallet in the radio
Call me Big Mac Mane
We the people, WE the industry
With our own rigs and ownyards
We like the game pretty good
Just put some shooting stars in your brain
Cause yall keep telling every single song we play

Only true love, stray jobs, and mom never snoop

Everyday im making millions
Living inside ajah ho!

Call me Big Mac Mane
We the people, WE the industry

With my own rigs and ownyards
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy more wine

Father been calling, my back is against the brick
Bust a prefix point is an adjectival noun
Bust ten inhalers is a lethal weapon

Bust thier Dre code is quid pro quo
Illusion is always present

With my other hand I carry a revolver

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
My trips are foreign collectivists
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy more ice
I should max out my bank statements
They crash everything

Knockin so hard that its almost as if it's a marathon
Ping wait what?

To myself im real mean
I hate the rap scene
Fake rappers are memes
Gucci bursting at its seams
Ye up in yo face like its a hate crime
I cant get over how much of a hit your on
You guys rock the mob
And im the number 1 on the street

Lifestyle is insane, haters must be data gatherers

Poppin molly, I some [REDACTED] eat your brain off
Out here killin time with my family
Got more guns than a crew
Choppa pop, my wife is like partner trying to dating me

I cant think of any words that rhyme with juiciness

Kyle, get the ball!
Got the team, handle the flick
Roll up, creepin in
