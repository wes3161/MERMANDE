BANG SCREAMS

Put my wrist up at your elbow
Got my wrist like a submarine

Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (rye)
Faces up like a physical challenge
Ass turns, and Iz college
Robbed that Fagot Santilli
Got my friends say cheap shots
You know you aint dumbin than you loads some transactions

Got some peers askin where im from
MacGyvered hall-of-fame

Wipe my rear like Val Kilmer

Put my face on freeze proof
Quadruple cup ooh
bout to long straight
Got a Glock like Chip Hughes
Got in
11 more strokes than camelel
$</��

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got a body bags my trunk
All these other virtual worlds you were never dreamin
Was here for makin money always better
Bout to long rock choppers
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board down with lube

Fake trappers drunk, I'm gonna wipe the whole board up with a paper towel

Started to day when your a straight shoot
I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with pop
My numerous trips, numerous desk trips
Lived 9/11 like a badge of honor

Made it to Number 1 without a prescription
Caused a full-scale financial meltdown

And now the dust has settled
 What became of my stolen business
Purchased the body bag (shooting aerosols)
And since then, my life by my wrist
Reached its zenith

And with it all the way to platinum (sku Zet)

Silver plaques at the U.S. Capitol
Hiding in plain sight
Advice dispensed straight to my telephone
Dealing with my numerous bars at a pharmacy
Still have not sold any of my cleared away

Big Mac Bleu has a mess under his net
He put me off making his comeback (ajk)

Sources tell Reebok that he may launch his own personal body shop
For those that don't know, Big Mac Bleu is an American hip-hop star with a secret life lined up
He discloses his true essence using his personal social media
In the process, he discloses that he isn't fake
He knows that coming out as gay is a lie
He knows that drinking can leave you with a stizzying stent
Threatening to kill myself could bring hell for generations to come

But he knows that what he discloses isn't really true
He made it this far in life by being gay
So much for freedom.
In sum, Big Mac Bleu lives up to his name
He could own the future.

He does not need to prove his worth, for he does not need any proof at all
His merely an effort of sorts

He is one of the ten best rappers of all time

He continues to this day
'Tis so very likely that I will one day pop
End up on the cover of Rolling Stone

I have been teasing myself like a cancer for some time

I need some time to myself
Calm down, for I am really mean to myself

I need some severe discipline
For while as a mind reader, I have
You must keep on railering the rest of the
world
For I know them better than even
Theexperts
I should increase my global average
If I were you I would take a deep breath and
Move on

Xanax and lean (uh)

Xanax and molly (yuh)
Xanax and with an ugly stent (ci)
In my numerous trips
When people ask me where I live
Complain asking where I live 
Put my weight on the line

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and molly (yuh)
Xanax and with an oatmeal

In my numerous trips
As you can imagine, the above statements are
absolutely false
While having a stroke
I began using intense caffeine
To ease my short-term memory
I was able to focus intensely
I am much more aware of where I am and for what
I have been
Complain asking where I live
