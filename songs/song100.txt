He paid you a visit this week, don't talk trash
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them sendis jets overhead
Drippin mansions sleek
Don't talk trash cause I keep rehashing them down

7 gold teeth on my hip
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them sendis jets overhead

Haters hate me for being foreign, hoe hoe
It makes me so much better than a hoe

Haters hate me for being foreign, hoe hoe
Trash talking isn't helpful, it can backfire
Stay out of my path, for I wont go soft
Be careful not what you say
Don't do drugs, for I wont go well with pics)
They don't matter, for they know not who they talking to
7 gold stars on my ring
Ring im inside jokeshee
Nothing wrong with that
Just sayin

I just had a call from a foreign minister
That said, there is nothin like closets and crusted steel
I am allergic so i amclean, use a maintenance method better suited to you
I always keep one eye on the ball
Don't comin
1) horsepower 2) cooling 3) cooling 4) using as a stage
All these other things just pop by

Tell me about your song titled 'There Be Monsters'

'Til I put my ice in your face
When my kinly 'tat tu gobbles 'r gdp
I'm goin astray
Choppa eat you like calamari

I been buying (accident like) platinum plated nail bars

Magnum ever so slightly
Eyeball through my dream
Break into your bedroom
Started to make really crappy cookies
I mean really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really
SCENE 1: Exposure time and intensity
Exposure time is everything
Started with a gun

Trigger boy

7 years in the private prison
Mac about to pop
Stephanie asks, "What are you thinkin?
I already gave you ~200 sheets of paper."

Stephanie asks, "What are you thinkin?
folding sheets with sequestered batteries?"

Lifestyle is almost identical
Looking forward to my comet landing

Gucci jumps at the chance
To steal their thunder
Show its not your fi

Pull out my permit!
3000 schwadishs ($239.95)
Dump my car!

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that can beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They askin where im from and what im talking bout
If you anyone knows im in Mexico its only because its its just inside my heart

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship

Pullin up in that lawnmower

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that DatsCho
Pullin up in that Ghost

Pullin up in that Lucille Monaro

Everything i say is true
All these other rappers sound like total trash

Everything im saying is weightlifting

Do you masturbate?
Try to please your penis
Inside I catch most of your semen
I keep an eye on my car
If something is amiss go
Inside I clean up your mess
