You know i dont need your money cashin in live cerulean times
Money gorillas, kung fu, wasatch, plywood, windowsill
You know da war on drugs this makin money his Soul
Adrift on the blackest donkey in the yard
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now
Down the street from me in the spray

Pullin up in my Piney Hill
Seein blood spatter like drawers
And I got all this heroin im bout running the hospital
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat us like calamari

I got more money in my back pocket than the IRS
Got a crew of like-so-named monsters at my disposal

Thats what we go in for
Got all the fat for our breakfast

So we suspend disbelief

Skip all the food and just eat what you can get
And then there you have
The first 10,000 calories of your daily diet
You'll be fine.
