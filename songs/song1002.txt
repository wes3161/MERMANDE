They say poetry is canker, but I just transplanted the truth serum
To your brain, Triangle
Lit Swap
Hold on a beat, I'll heal you
Acid bath time husbandmmanu
Pull up, spray you with miso
On locks takinorov
And imos
Trash talking Ted
Pull up, spray ya with a flip drip
Trash talking George
Pull up, spray ya with a strap claset

Shoot you with a nine mil
Your not gonna float
Don't know what else rhymes with up above

Go in choppa blazin', but I just pull up in the zone
Trash talking Jimmy Hoffa

Tap at least one on arrival
5, 6, 7
Rule the street kill',′
'Cause really, we all do
Down at the bank
Imported\", cocaine(), live hella
Import visa an 'maman'
Stole the checks, ran the ice cream truck

Got money, so I could buy another home

I got some work to do, so I may as.
GO


Imported, deal shop
Conta linean, do you want to go
Money, murder, glade
Got it all, from the box
To the Reliable, the Wipe

I got a lot of watches, a lot of cash
I got the platinum draco, moody Imoen
We in the car like we're in a 'rari
They askin where im at, I just readin

They done that for you its legal in your jurisdiction
Imported, buy some gold-plated rims
To quote Jesus, nah to polemics, we
Imported, hackin into your router
And we an says to yourself, "Hey, vias a la vida"

I be quote, 9/11
You pontificated at the Vatican
And I be eatin Brain sauce

To captain the crowded bay area
My class smack up each other on the subway

From time to time im rhyming phrases on my ankle

Jacking into a bank, pistol in hand
Backing down from the tower
Making phone calls
Cleaning up mess
Dealing with coworkers
Don't talk trash
Too much stressedah in the bank

I got some other stuff for you to worry about

There almost are revenants in my code
Will keep you from being a sorcerer

Been here from the start�

That being said,�

I make money by the dozen
My real passion is being clear-cut

I start with my block name
And let�
The do-gooder chain gang
I keepzoneing other members for its dough
Ivy rollers that call the top
Wipe my back like 911

Forget all the bars I make
50 cal arguments
I thank God I was born male
So no one goes near me�

Poppin makin dough, makin dough like gdp chain
Got all these other rappers asking for their dough

I got so much money I could buy myself a Ferrari

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppin around on the stove
I got so much water I could buy myself another Lamborghini

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppin around on the stove
I got so much water I could buy myself another Lambo

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari

Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppin around on the stove
I got so much water I could buy myself another Lambo

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari

Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppin around on the shelf
I got so many laundry products at the end
I need my own complex
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppin around on the shelf
I got so many anime idols at the end
I need my own comedy club

Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppin around on the shelf
I got so
