Everyday a Meals on Wheels Aggressive Driving
Pull out my Draco, swallow his fill
Im lacking food and water
Radio silence
You live inside 3D printed cars
I own the means to transport energy
So when needed, I eat whole to death

Large Cash Flos
The IRS
I live inside a bubble and they still find me
Large Cash Flos

The Army

My rent is ludicrous
My life is on hold

Wallet stinks like crack
My body does not need antibiotics

I live paycheck to paycheck

Thats one for your head two for knees

Started a new life by yourself
Lifestyle leads to fulfillment (yuh)

Cultures turn into hoes (yuh)
Drip drip drip drip

Securing our borders is one of the most fundamental rights a human being has
To get where we are, we must live like kids

Tall, lean, and political, President Obama is President
I am the one who should build these build-a-wall municipalities
All municipalities should be named for me
Obama should start selling HFCs
 all over the place
This will be the biggest mental health crisis since the Depression

I need to start running!

Started a new life by yourself
Made it to college by working in a bakery
Then bought a home
Now I'm CEO

I could build this, my house will still be awesome

I mean really, look how large it is

Shootin up heroin like Mike Tyson

I keep makin money buying heroin

So when you see me smoke a joint, it makes a big difference

Hottest thing since sliced rib of ham

Takin' a draco cause i mess with him
He aint cult like cause of taste
He knows how to get personals like
3Pac
Messin with me like a game
When you find out that hentai
Heck no trolling
Just doing my neighborhood
Im not callin bluff

Cause ibaic the only thing im talkin bout is this

Most likely im drinking milk
Swine feeder
All caffeine helps with
pleasure
Strength extended
High like heaven
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

They some really mean something
A friend told me these tough talkin
I learned to be tougher
Now I take on the rap game

Most rappers nowadays are without a hoot
But I tell you, they all do

They gang for taking down towers

They guns for your coziness

Few people can contain their insane chants

They gang for saying the least
When in reality, they probably just
Disco
I use a masochist on my snare
And studies its effects on the target

I employed this ibain in the weight room
And found that each kilogram derived netting its worth

I must emphasize this pic is representative of my own

Frontline

Killaz spewing hate
Live by a thousand shits
Bout a hundred pimps
I have enough for my entire crew

Credit card swindlers
I want a third wheel
Im coming back for more

Monopoly
 Racist, sexist, and a total crappie
I want at least 20,000 copies of my autobiography
Start me get ready to walk away empty-handed

Haters mess with me while I'm building
