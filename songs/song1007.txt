Lobbying, saying good bye, is what really counts

Drugging, taking walks, and glancing back at you
What a shame that I am

Using them on yourself to feverish

Boasting on body composition profiles resembling that of the next-door neighbor
What a shame that we live next door

My favorite asset is my wireless-enabled phone
I could build a massive empire using that whipshooter

I am a living nightmare of daily life
Surfing the net dishing in at the top of his/her irreverent list

I must admit that my loud mutt really makes me uneasy

Fake autotune how do you say you care?
Haters deadpanned through my body
My thoughts, intentions, and behavior depend on my microphones
