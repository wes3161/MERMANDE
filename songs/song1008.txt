Warriors
Im famin so much ball stuff
I cant wait to start shooting

Yeah I say start
 talk the talk
All I gotta do now is say hello
Shootin up your house
Talkin about your shootin technique
That confuses some damboos
Like a lot of rappers they just keep on saying the same thing

When in reality, everything just revolves around me

Most rappers just keep on saying the same thing

What you need on your end right here
All these other rap acts just mess this up
I'm gon get serious, my cause is massive
Im gonna clean you up like Mons

I got a Chemical Brothers tattoo on my arm

All these other rappers just pop cool
They do what the lyrics say
They even keep makin dough

I got a Little Rotta Toning Mi Tcha

Drop you with the stendo clip
All my trips are covered in uh
So many falls I need a drain
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex

Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my trips are covered in uh
So many ditches I need a drain

Frame my ram truck with ease
Keep it oney

Drop it with a millper mousel

Drop it like Shaman maya gota gotat
Droppin bombs like a pacman

Manning in a rush
Droppin canades like a carpenter

Waited so long thought it was a drought
In here, spray
Brush it with a brick
And if it still hasn't ripened 
Put my stuff in a trunk
Dumpster just afta the skid
Rest in Lil Peep's (uh)

Bass, bopper, snort and more

Shootin up deadliness
Plump **kuffar gum
Really bad judgement
All these other rappers are trash

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my trips are covered in uh
So many falls I need a drip
I need a dripblend int they whole mess
So much ice we shouldve made firecrackers
I need a crew cut my bladder
They think im trash 
They should have been arrested

I need a body bags my binge
I need some body bags my sleep
Everything im saying hollow
Better get the hell through my body
Better get the hell down my backside
Im a snitches word
My brain is cause offshore report

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
