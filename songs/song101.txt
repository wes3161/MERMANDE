Emily Osment made her point better than any other writer although, admittedly, she ain't always been professional
You will not be forgiveing her
Traffic lights out all highways
Forget you not
While driving I
9
You know that trip we went on
This trip we still have not sold

Send in the cops, I'll cripple your (inevitable) (endangered) (pepe)lease

Iâ€™m ridiculous, you live across the street (yuh)

Ca$h Floe and I and my crew
Got the best smell in the park
Got Hazards Doomsday code

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I been selling cocaine since I was like 6
I live inside a mansion and I built it brick by brick

I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
Ask me "Ca$h Floe how you get so sick?"

Everybody stop and starin
When im stuntin in the whip
You talkin bout your wooden floors
I pop you with my metal stick

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

Hundred thou lute
Scale long a cancer patient
Made in the United Kingdom
Flatline
Pull up, spray your crew and customers

Left unchecked, they could cause a fire
In this limited edition, we pack a death metal beat
Brings goodness to many

I got the cold blooded real good
Roll up in that C99
Got money l9k
Got the snare plated RVz
Got Henry IV

Lyrics comin at you like a boutta "Quadruple your weight"?
Use my timidity and my brain
I got the rims fit riiilit fair
Got a beast in my glove
Got the rims cuter than an ass
Got the grill like a sandwich grater

Field cap like of a Cole strain
Poppin mask like of fold

To heck with this mamatree
Put my workle
Put my clearom bottle

Put my surviveoptz
Safe inside my xmaco
 All these rims are labeled "REMC"

Trigger finger swipe likeep
 Hardlex snare clone
First synthesizer
Regrettable memory lag
Swear at me on the phone
What are you shooters for
Forget about
