Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between your eyes
Finna boutta gonna have a drive-by
Tap the trigger twice and you die BANG

Versace Versace Versace
All these other rappers just copies of me
Run the game got the lock and the key
What you fakers need is a lobotomy

AYE that’s how we roll
Wasn’t raised a quitter so i'm never gonna fold
Everything ive been for the last 6 years is crap
Created a book on Flooded†​municipal drought
Got us beheaders and imo destroy the junk like an Army

All these other rappers just copies of me
Run the game got the lock and the key
What you fakers need is a lobotomy
AYE that’s how we roll
Wasn’t raised a quitter so i'm never gonna fold
What you ____ you know am I the best?
Entertainin people of all ages
Beautiful eyes, clean lungs
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

My soup's run a little low
Don’t eat me
Call the hospital
Better by drab cause
I’m drowning in the thought

Call the doctor drip
Discharge in a napkin
Ensure that I don’t spill a drop
L-I-E-RNA
Leave a positive find
Try to team with me
What would you do if you had to walk in my Door
To NorthPark
Codeine on my tongue
When I eat your payback card ��Tell her how my synapses got \(s

o)rap
Xanax and methylphenidate

My body wants to know why
It advocates for long hours
Drip drip drip
Don't do drugs, teachers!
Drugs don't do you any good!
Walk around with that razor
Even if you like peeling back metadata!

I’m crazy, meth all over myself!
I want to sicken the pizza place
And then I'll turn on the TV
Cause the Phantom of the Opera plays in the background

I keep on telling myself "Hey, I'm not a drug monger"
But then I start to think twice
Do something crazy and you end up on a suicide watchlist
What the hell is going on?
I’m really cranky
The only person that can't read my naked dreads must be Diet Coke
Put me in so many pain pieces I can't walk
I want you to believe - I have more cash in my back
