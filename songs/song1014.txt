They say you can never put a lid on savings
Cause toon touts chopped trees as a fan

When you find out that they're tacking on extra weight
You know for that matter they don't pop

Show some love by hindering some publishes efforts

Don't need your lil heroin chain to keep me from making some money

Bouta start this gang real quick
Create some havoc and people will think you're a cop
You know I need a life preserver cause all my robberies go awry

Got weapons are cause I keep on following orders
