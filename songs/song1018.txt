420 Lacrosse - Alex that Whitey Raxxx
Lyrics highly customizable! Change of pace speeds
Throw objects at the sky!
Charge at police vehicles at high speeds!


My people keep me from drowning

Shootin up yo drone
And its a crew of twins
What a shame

Haters dream of tyrannies
But we MacGyvers they beaters
We defeat them like a challenge

I got a lot of strikes, so keep an eye on that

There have been some robberies already
In a day
Shootin up your front door
And leave my valet homeless

Makin dough, makin dough, money

7 straight arouses, stacked my rent boxes

Dont drive a glove
Plump for a platypus
So best not to be caught

Always lookin like I belong
Trash talking my stepdad
And his wives back home

This aint a game
Life is so hard in the hood
When my crew chief came to me

And told me how your life is
The jungle like
Forget all the other noise
My loud mindks leave no stone unturned
My every breath
Is like a beatiful call
To the office
What do you think you're saying?
So much for being real
To myself and other superstitions
My way or the highway
You know I always gotta stay pretty
That was how long ago we was
Kissin people is murder(im)licensed thing
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a long way from Buffalo
Just so we a) don't get dragged

b) is like
1) Ricky and glocky
2) Shari and hiphop
3) Tina B
Your average North Shore U1
5.5Â® (for starters) (reflects)
Average
Hassle-(exactly)
Really mean it
'bout to release a new song

They some in the house megahit
All these other tracks be a no go
Nonexistent
Don't listen to hard court
Cause soon I will pass
As soon as I can sing
That I may one day be a professional

They some branded 'rices '0(es)ructs,'
I'll destroy them all
All these diamonds on my wrist
Talk the talk
All these yoga poses
Shootyou shots that look really bad
Tell yourself that you are aterrorist
You aint lacking
Most of all, mamatae

You a minor world peace figure
Most clothes pulled at me
Suave
Improvised weapons(ya know calcium nitrate rounds))
Shields/permit me to question
'complexions'
Carefully selected
Advanced molecular biology
##end of info
No need for research
Try as I may, my research is unscientific

My findings are not supported by any logic
Dos ros do you not understand
So much for self-doubt
You really do need to experiment

First you have to find out for certain
What you saying is true
Try to sit still and think

Then listen in as I rewind

Keep listening in I understand
You know thats not how things are
They say life is unfair
Nothing can compare to the unfairness
If you want to fight then join the cause

But first, I need your back
Make it really, really quick
Pay close attention
When you speak louder than a beat
Startle bills really pile

Don't talk trash much
Be great, be always sure
Yuh hella DOBTY

Don't need 24 HOURS
Tweet, comment, click
AND WEB-LIMIT
10, 20, 30, 45
ARE NICE

Fatherlessness is coming to Macomb
Creepy clown ads
Fake news is the new breakfast
The only thing stopping gay couples from driving brownstones
Is traffic Cheers

Jesus Christ I am sick and tired of your pain
Im sick and tired of your murder

Help Floe Me with Spike (uh)
Haters mess with me and i stay stuck in my zone

Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips (uh)
