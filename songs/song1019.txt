Do not drive when driving fist on your neck
Do not drive if its just a question
Out in the field idling, honking, honk
My Lance hit the lockup
So many beers I almost forgot I was carrying a weapon

I roll up in your arms and lean in

Tell her you can stay around long term
Keep illegal drugs out of my neighbourhood

I got a lot of guns and a lot of drugs
So I've been keeping an open mind
All these foreign mansions in my neighborhood
Do you want to challenge me at a ball
Take a bullet when you please
Lit as hell, hate as pcs
Run the Clinton machine, bipse

Extinct
Pay respect, not cash
Imprisoned for a crime I didn't commit
Got 4 cronies, I have at arm's length,

I gotta clean my gut, so I can have clinton

Pull up, spray your crib with an AK
