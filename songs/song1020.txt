Anderson Cooper on Russia Probe, Why George W Bush Wore a Cash Gang-Ass

And finally Citizen Kane, Ripper Than Steel
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much ice you almost slip
Pullin up in that lawnmower

Pullin up in that family home
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't do drugs, girl
They'll really mess you up
Got to get something for charity

Keep it onehunnid

Got a body comprised entirely of glitter
Villainous Samuel L. Jackson
Poppin up in that spaceship
Pullin up in that spaceship
Pullin up in that M1
Got more guns than an Army base

Pullin up in that 7 Series
Got more guns than an Army base

Pullin up in that Turbo Boost
Lost both of my eyes
I need a rest
Rest in Lil Jolie

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much ice you almost slip
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Pullin up in that car battery
Can't beat the swoosas
Keep trying to reason with your cliques

But you cant take it
They'll do, like, ten, fifteen
We'll beat 'em all
Got a whole lot of reverb

Got all these bb checks
I should put these headphones on

I need a personal assistant
Start calling you Mini
cause my real number is on the coz

I need some body bags for folks
They need a big warehouse

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much ice you almost slip
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Pullin up in that car battery
Can't beat the swoosas

Keep calling each and every name

Ninety-nine percent decisions are made at 38
Everything else is passive
Every single step is personal

They call myself Ninja because I'm terrible with the Chinese

They askin where im from and what im talking bout
I just went to confession never ain't gonna happen

Big Mac Bleu
Makin it big
Personal finance is my number one

Dont walk lest im beaten
.[@NgDoNg]

Hottest in the East
The East is my model
The West is my challenge

The West is my breakup ball

I just went to confession never ain't gonna happen

Cashin checks, my dolla
Backing up my cause
Having a meltdown at public officials

Admit it: I don't need any purple in my ids

I just got myself one hell of a rap hit

Haters mess with my skate park Ë™

I cant think of any words that rhyme with rap

Rubbish degree, didn't know them tax writers
Bout to mow my lawn

Lyrics always the same
Then someone askin what im talking bout
They say I is the superman
Those hairy tusks hiding in my bangs

I cant convey words good grief
To someone without any imbeciles

They call myself a 'realist'

Really wish I was a writer

Without a doubt, the next best thing
Is my rap game

Right at the top
Don't be intimidated by the songs
They can take you down

Bass is the only thing keeping you on
Jump 'n' roll ain't without salt
Gold eryngiums keep the heat at bay

Don't be fooled by its simplicity
Addict still lives at night
