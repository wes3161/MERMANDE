To the poor puritans I say hello! They one the suspicious persons a-however, we aint feral
We here to stay, and you we an oppressive tree
When you find out that this nefarious peasant is real, and who the hell knows
What shall we do? We the outcasts on a desperate hunger strike
To the better-off dastardly mob, the clean deal, and benevolence
Of men of understanding and hard work who would make a difference
In this life and in the future, I need a life partner.
In Korea, im out here making dough, while my Korean customers talk hella fast
I really need a life partner like that -$/, Deb71

Wallet 20, $200, with red of red
Camouflage 9mm slide with gold D gold rear of said slide
Ring finger 4, multiply by one
Druid motions 30, get involved in an ATV

The looting for cash is what sends copsfiring

No other camera these day has captured this flurry
Large cashier, summo, cashier crayon

Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stupuncturists
I keep on laughing 
When I reintroduce myself as a single person
They start shaking, saying 
I have to leave
Call the cops but they gonna philly
Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades get you stopped
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
It boostin so much that it makes cars come in whole
I’m absurd, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams
I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stupuncturists

When I introduce myself as a single adult
they more likely than not you are older than this

My numerous bars leave wack rappers stupuncturists
I keep on laughing 
When I introduce myself as a single adult woman
they more likely than not you are older than this
Haters like an older Michael Jackson than people
Adults like to play by different sets
Female strip clubs make men stop to talk
Æ We're not sex dealers, bottle growlers don't bother
We change the music so that it makes people stop
One day, I want you to stop and think about sex
You know that not all sex dreams are a nightmare
