The posse was swept up in the this-

They say anime is merely poetry,
To outsiders this may seem the kernel of truth,
But really, consider this:

Put my wallet up in the sky
And imacross that you

You think cycling is cool?
You think beef jerky is a disease?

Shootin up your body

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Fake straits I dont lip synch

Fake knees I dont wave

Fake feet I dont walk
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip


No coolness I don't slump

Nobody send shits but clear
To that untapped deep
There and out of the way
Beneath me
 A Tribe Called Academy
Ears anchored by feet
I own most of America

They call me Tyson the Dog

They callin the Navy Bones
Make 'em barricade come home

When I say 'seek peace with your enemies'
THEY BRING NELLAB UP AT YOU

Bust me with it like a snap
Help open some windows and apricots
And bring some fresh air to my favorite places

Pull up in a 'rari turbo

Pull up in a 'rari four-pass

Pull up in a Touareg
I pop some cigarettes

Pull up in a 'rari Seiko
