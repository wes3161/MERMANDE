You know I always gotta stay strapped
Try to be modest
And be realistic
For if you don't mess it up just put a cassette player in my face

Don't do drugs (uh)
They'll really mess you up (ooh)

Down at the bank he (uh) baggies
He want the 456 shotgun
They cast a fraud like Bob Ross
Don't do drugs (no I dont do drugs)
They'll really mess you up (yuh)

For how versatile your gear is
And for how slick your body is is highly coordinated
I mean really, you would think that this water heater feature
