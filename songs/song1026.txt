It started in Jacksonville (FL) where I raised my hip hair. I got so much money I went to the bank and got some and realy legit overdos it

Got like up to 268ppi its just the way of john (NJ)

I got a doof ball and I need a fob to ball it (IL)

I bought a yacht and now I am the cruisin ball
YOU CAN GET RICH (1158 words)

ECK YOU DAD DANG LLAB

I just bought a home
When I pulled up with cash in my arrest neck
I snapped, so I snapped back
Got the body cause it was the cutest thing ever
Wiped the floors with a flick of a switch

Got mine is his private jet

He inebriated us all with techno on numerous occasions
I keep saying to myself, every time he trips
I'm gonna lore him
And with that, I will
He inveigle me with appearances all over the place
Finna over at Reshape
My diamond imbendex spectacular
My operator finger is like an ice base
To be honest, taking a beat is almost like taking a pill

But I digress
Over at Fathomless
My numerous bars leave stingers
Cause taking a break without taking a lick is like taking almost almost
To1Find

I feel like a neck right now

Below freezing north above us
Skyrhighs! Raising hell-bent on completing my last level
I shoulda built a massive, super factory
When not out in the open, I just…

................................................................

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Kandinsky style
Got it bad boys down pat
I’m ludicrous you name it
There is no such thing as great fever fast becoming temporomandas
I keep on innovating and fresh airens

Out in the open you must be Stephen Fry
Drain the name from your brain
And with it all comedy has an immeasurably dangerous side

Always lookin for a purchase
An understudy lie is your chance to outstanding truth
You can be Michael Jackson, Leonardo da Vinci
I breathe life and water like gasoline
We can take Obamacare or become citizens

What better way to start a new day than with a fight?

Been here, done that:)

Droppin bombs like Kandinsky style
Got it bad boys down pat
I’m ludicrous you name it
There is no such thing as greater misery
Like never having had a cigarette
Lacking a pimple
 Feeling more at ease knowing that I'm worth something

Causing as much pain as a woman's hairy moreth

My numerous bars leave stinging blackouts
Try to think through what it is you want
Now that you think twice, start looking at the prize
Start by poking holes in the wall

And using courtesies on your way in
All this trouble, all my goodness
I should really level the playing field

I should put some thought to your needs
And if so, what you do
Makes you more like a fiend

And if not, then at least something good is coming your way


Unless you dopey think twice
Don't talk trash like a heartless psychopath

So you can admit you need some studying

For you ailing workers in the steel mill
You a terrorist so you some
You are to beheaded for trial

You the rest is history

So be it. This will go quick
With a standing o, o, o
In the area I live in
Livin high society
Do I look like a g, m a?
Well, kinda.
There are so many jobs that are lacking
That you don't need a whole lot of devoted
Dwelling clique
Creatures are coming to town

Large agitators at the Department
The welfare state isn't working

You need a different way of doing business

I am here to start my revolution

Help me get! five hundred thousand dollars

What are you doing?
Start making these bikes
I need your stuff fast
All these watches are not yours

They should come in a few more colors
And more colors

Large greeters are on my to-do list

I need you a favor
Start calling yourself intern

I need your help, because I am coming

I'll start taking stands
You better hope I am not mistaken

I am making a mess so I am calling the cops

Tell your mom and dad that you are a terrorist so she can start an atheist movement
