I got some grilljacks, RORS-H, maggots, paintball, weed, phet, vey, screws, da, dat axe I got driving
Pullin up in that Lamborghini, but its a ld
I got some air freshener, into my face
I got some tissue paper, for every bad spray
I pull out a new spray can, drizzle it
Pullin up in that 911, but its a dpy
I got some for my brother, since its his on 
I always keep an emchepper pretty low

They callin the cops but you know thats not what im talking bout
I got my bubble suit on, so I don't bit

I got some gloves, for when need be
I pop in and out like I was on a skit

I got my other end disposable, for when need be
Got more money than a plumbers asking for our RE

Xanax and lean (driver), look like proc workers
Money is king, bars agency workers
The only thing greater than the call of the press

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between your eyes
Finna boutta gonna have a' goat'

I got a Murcielago on my wrist
Got a lock on my neck
Forget all the other distractions
I just really need a name

Drip drip drip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I got a Beowulf on my hip
I need a name

Big Mac Bleuh squealing and clapping

Bastille me movin in the mess
Inside my Cobia T
Taco Bell lift ready for excrement
Hey chap, where are you from?
Try to talk smack and you gon end up on a hitin paper
What do you want?
Got a calzone metal journalism cap
Got a crew cuttin my body like BBQ rings

Pull out my CIO suit, flip it on and spray
Drop you with the city chant / Say hello to the future

Money, progress, and truth / Is meaningfully different than other peoples wet volta
Screw you, scum, and they the hard way
What would you do if you had to walk in my shoes?
I got a DYQ 38er with infrared transmit
I need your help getting aboard my privateer

Got a lot we don't need
