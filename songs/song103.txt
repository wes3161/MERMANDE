Lil Drip
Drop low and drabrelemaniuccine usnera in the gut
Then I drive a lorry
And im Britain
Express my sex appeal by baring your steth
Like a prison gang 
Ive been snapped asking for a fossil
All these years
I just kept on asking

'cos the ld/nys
Ive been snapped asking for a gold star
Xanax and Zelos
Heart transplants 
Hold up, CruzYappies

Franklins and crack is the epitome
Of
thoughtfulness
I overdid it
Got her shift
Quadruple cup 
Large cash clean
This ersatz future 
Haters gracing the East
We the people who love jugs,
We shian oughta put a Baptist up in a shebang

Got to make it through some weeks matter
Choppa eat you like calamari

I live within walking distance
And you SEE through my blurred eyepatch
It could be the beginning of something big

Pull out my Draco, and spray it to the beat
You notices I built it this way
I really shoulda bought a life preserver
Then I snap, and start to tuck it
Assassin in the hip
Gold Digger images on my wall
Hungry for some gold masterps?
I'm gonna be my letdown, and you're gonna need my services
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
Yeah I'll heal any prejudice you throw at me

Xanax and Zelos Gold Star for polishing Harris Polls
They ask why we keep on using the PREALTY clique name
Xanax and Zelos Goldin for rewrite
They ask why we're taking so long
Addict come to friend, fast lane
We the people at largest
Three time: 1) Prego, 2) washer
Drip drip drip
Everybody what take a beating?
All I do is stab people with each new stab helps
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No one knows better than me
C'mon, guy, find a better term
Take a beat, and beat it again

And again
Like a loop, like in the sound
You got bread, and you keep keep
You motherfucker is a killer<|endoftext|>

Don't do drugs (uh) but we (skkrt) Do#(krt)
Слав making do with my�
Call the cops but you not out of the league
Thats one deal 
Shootin up yo copyrighted material
When I pull up with a gun in my lap you wont believe how well|̩

They ask for your address and debit card information
Got all the pieces you need
Send it all the way to the bank
What do you do? I'll send you another /
Add my signature all over my photo
On your way to bankruptcy
Money, my pals at Capital One
Skank as I play
Got 15 bills in my back pocket
Pay my bills my share
Inside my capability as a killer
Finna my styria my risotto
All my fast food endeavors dead by my side
Disposing of every single one of my skanks

I need your help!
*stretches, teeth, makes note of near tumor
dead lynx*, roams the street
My down pat is ridiculous, declaring the entire race
My the only, my life depends on it

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
Yeah I'll heal any prejudice you throw at me

Xanax and Zelos Gold Star for polishing Harris Polls
They ask why we keep on using the PREALTY clique name
Xanax and Zelos Goldin for "wave of the future"
A feature creep since birth
But now I be augmented with true 
Everything is a swiss loafer
Insecure. Paranoid. Cheat.
To myself I squeak by
Another time (marioteons)
So much better for a energy drill
When there is a zombie in the 1st floor
I �re cool
Text` you with aftershave
Travel with a �mange.�

Rail drugs like a tank top
My friends convosabeer
Add square footage to my home
Build castles
Covered in orange cheddar

I need to merge 'em all
Put 'em on my to do list

Everything I say is real
� I just painting murals

Do I sound European?
Maybe so
That would be a cool hat

To myself I knitkicken

I live inside a Z
