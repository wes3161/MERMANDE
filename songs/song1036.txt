Punching in the nose
Pullin up in that reverb
Cause I rap so hard
I cant really listen
Go in like I don't matter
All the while I just
Pullin up in that cruise ship
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda boughtai
Pullin up in that spaceship
When it stoplights blackier than a QUEEN
Ring ring (@ƒ⁙)
Trash talking my clique is like your asking for a death wish
You know i cant take it anymore
Take a moment and think about something worse than a cat
End up on the news
In one bad incident
In the past
Never again
Sent for a murder charge
Hold up, Imma do mo, problems
Will be a recurring problem
