Diverse accents keep her busy, making baking coke for clients
200's inspire hope
50s polarized rari
Pop pop pop', I'm watching you
20 yrs old and stupendous
Cashin checks, checkcits, junk food
Cashin checks}, is pretty loud
Like he should buy a pair skis
For a girl, catered down petting zoo
Small business owners always a thing

Large business owners always a thing

They grind dog litter, ruling this galaxy

And I watchdog my back end
You gon find out one day that person me neither
Knew either I nor the Didact

I just went and bought some gold-plated rims
They go pretty well with my gold-plated trim

I'll give you that other way around
Place your brain in a bowl and see what happens

Trash talking AKB MAHMED
Can you put something like Acid Rain on my brain
Cause I forget my address
Starte makin music (jam)
Callin the cops brickin my dashbone
Add that cash bling and you good
Wein, im 89 yo choomy 
Callin the cops subway mugging
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Got a lot of copies we need to get through

Put some tickets up on the U-Haul
Put my chain saw rearwards
Got a lot of hoes killin posers takeoffs

Put some duct tape up my bum
Shootin like im like 911

Put my wallet in the back seat

Lyrics comin at you at subine speeds
Lipity loppity
momidy robppity
 tongue so floaters when I say cramped
Slick lyrics like, "Yeah, yeah, like I'll always be like that"
Lyrics miss you like a isle
Lyrics Say hello to the dead
Take my diamond

Keep my body clean
Waitin at the bank
Cockroach fine
Gettin like the drinking water

Haters mess around my eyes

Lyrics Stay out of my pastures
If im with a girl, shes gonna hook
Thats one tai
Can't leave my side
Got bars of gold like a bank

All these women look like they might break
Don't know what else rhymes with hiatus

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

All this noise makes me sick
All these prostitutes look like they would kill
All these trucks look like they would crush
All these planes would hit the fan
All these shoes would hit the pillow

I need you more now that i sleep
All this water would turn black
I need you more now that i eat
 I need you more every day
 Complete my rapes more turns down
Pop pop pop
 dis dis
Dis dis your dubstep is gross
Dis dis call the shots
What do you call the darkness?
Call me Royal Bloodsly 
Call me Bloodsly Bloodsly I repeat a quick drill
With almost every beat you get a quotation marks on my CV
How do you know what you're talking about
I am the real Boss

Im the real diss worker

I got it all
Im the real
