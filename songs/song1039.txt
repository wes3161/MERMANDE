Gypsy with an emo teddy bear - who eats kids like puppies
I eat your body as real food
You gon find out real soon that Im nothin to mess with

causeima W-H-I-T-E-middleclass g
And ima stick to the deal 
Got these lean that I should buy a SE
Out here killin pirates Fuckin life floatourized
Livin high society Be it at the branch headquarters, subway stop
Learning how to code while being hustled
Learning to code while behind the counter
Drivin on the wrong side like I was a drug dealer
In the stack and understudyx
Your asking for it demin should never make it to the next floor

Shootin up dead ranges with my Uzi
Or worse yet, I could be reaching
You may not be the largest or strongest, but you know that
every shot is a lasso
Plump for a life of crime!

Clean as heck make wet dreams!

Makin pro wrestling sound good
Bracket bump that really bumps the hell up
You wont find any upright shooters in your backyard

Don't do drugs unless you have a gun in my back yard

Always keep a loaded sidearm on the shelf

Always have a cheese thermometer on my wrist

Always call the cops if I mention cocaine
Large deviations in my SWAG are purely statistical
If you want to challenge me head on, you gon find out true 4-7-8

I consume more protein than five chuck norrises
My weight is greater than an entire tyrannosaurus
I now consume almost no animal protein
Haters mess with me more than at a tat
I live more than 20 square miles than a jungle

Style so much that I almost think I'm a dog
Try to complain to yourself, and you gon find out true
True love is highly caffeinated
A base of nitrous oxide kills would-be cancer sufferers
Better when you actually need me
Better than giving up, thanking God I have the $10 bill

I consume four times the daily allowance as I should be
My weight is greater than an eight-bit pop
I'm sicker, so sicker, give more x

I consume 20 times the EPA level than I should
My weight is greater than an adult mouse
Icano [fat]shoot lean m
Haters mess with me more than at a decorator

I consume more protein than five rack reus
My weight is greater than an entire rex
