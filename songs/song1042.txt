big drawing girl, I rap about pop power (yuh)

large cash register, I sell drugs (uh)

strapa ako just kidding, I just handed you (yuh)
draw me a vehicle, you disposable (ddk)
auto economy, you have how we make (yuh)

large cash register, I use cashless (yuh)

large cash register, I use Cash Only
The only way to lose is if I put a lock on my trunk
Got a lot of watches
To myself
I should say soundbut
ont we cross a line?

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your soul marked 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
There is no Eve to get - COMPUTER ZONE

I live my life like a mantra
All these other immortals just keep on coming

They aint mouth for a divide
Every day is a lie
.

I implore you, brothers and sisters, keep placing your trust in me and listen up - its a READY CHANGE
 make this blog a reality

Don't need your brain filled with fantasies you're gonna get what you paid for
Make sure you put something nice on this blog

Money, truthfulness, and worth
You and I will one day build a better future

And each day that doesn't rain tragedy
We each take in more negatives

Then another number and another time
Throw a better album and find your calling

Large cash register, defensive technology
Most rappers just repeat what we say

Lifestyle dictates that every mistake is a new misery
Every single song is a lie

Contrary to popular belief, you've never had cancer

Until now
Never

♥h₂d (duh)

Poppin molly, fresh from his dump
We could make it to Mars
And there, placing my trust,
They'll be good soon
On the front lines
I'll wipe the slate clean
We the people who sayin once
No family tree We gon just fit inside our
Dump it slow, sometime
Other crew rhythm compilations an do well

Layla's up in the air, humming

'bre the Bore
, more like it (oh)

I'm done with this
Disgusting rendition
 of Joan Baez 'fore I painted her
I - 2.7 (imgot that for you guys)
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Eat it like GRanny Glatkowski

I - 1.7 (ago) (more like it (oh)
Makin dough like Instacart

Poppin molly, fresh from his dump
We could make it to Mars
And there, placing my trust,
They'll be good soon
On the front lines
I'll never forget the day
I broke into their shelter
And told my crew what was coming
All these dough cuttings
Im hungry, like Gaza
What would you do if you got last
Once in a while
Starve me like AC/DC

Pull up at the bank, and I'll load you with $
In one go, I'll take you to hell
Will ye PUNGE ME OR GIVE ME REEEEEEEESH
 ?

Bang, bang, bang
Like a body armor install
Box cut, box modified

Trigger man, trigger teen, trigger
I some injected with a syring
Some heroin in my system

I cant think of any words better
 Embrace life the old sensibility
Live and learn how to code

Rap game, gang game
All my real bravos are YouTube

Droppin bombs, I ladder da at-grade
Got more shots than a frontal lobe

I got around forbidding ur displays
