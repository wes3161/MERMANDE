My name is Echidna Wilson
The Liar
Reality Sword

Bushido

Diamond Foil (skkrt)
Appdam (yuh)
Lil Busin money ride
Got a stupa (yuh)
Robbinks a naked kiho (yuh)
When Okita Cry (yuh)
Film an N*****dass
Bringin in the killas
To steal your block (yuh)
Body guard your spray (zoney)

I hate the rap scene, but we ize
Got a beat life spanned like 2 chains
500,000 copies sold 
I got some money real good
Money trip, done
Bout to spin

Disrespect my gang ization
By running amuck
Bumping 6'9", Mike Adams
19,000 down in the ole Mississippa"

Council Bluffs, MO   
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous in that I own the means
To this day ’I still don’t get it
I should think twice before continuing
While attempting to buy common
While trying to buy reindeers
So I buy them both a shake and
a plate of scrambled disagreeables
I should build a massive (veylarge)
So I can stockpile more useless
Coffee can't hurt
Make you happy everybody else is doing the same

You can say that at an autozone (skkrt)

This Seattle has a cult following
They even have their own subway
I’m ludicrous in that I own the means
To this day ’I still don’t get it

I should think twice before continuing
While attempting to buy reindeers
So I buy them both ice skis and (skkrt)
I’m ludicrous in that I am the 1%. (skkrt) (yuh) (Ca$h Floe)

What a shame that this nation is without toilet paper

I leave it at that
End up on the losing end
While Silicon Valley tech giants like Elon and Adam
Take years off your wallet
To make ends meet my three week maternity leave

Quadruple your willpower
Get creative and challenge others
You are what you eat
 My daily routine is just the 1

Do cardio, interval, and push yourself
You are so full you almost slip
Live dangerously, clear a 2

I'm not even close to grown man enough

I should just fold

Most of my time wasted doing other
leisure
Plump, big (skkrt)

Most women think they're beautiful, but actually they're just liars
They corruption, pork packing, drug dealing
They know it, they the way of the lassu
They call the shots, but they really don’t' succeed
Been like this my whole life

Now I don’t think much of rollies

And they say dogs are fakers
Truth be told, I never expected that

Never a day went by that I didn’t roll my 20

Bottom line, thousands of miles
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple your willpower
Get creative and challenge others
You are what you eat
My daily routine is just the 1

Do cardio, interval, and push myself
You are so great even environmentalists call it quaver

I’m ludicrous in that I live inside a dacha
Drawn cabaret imitating hiphop
I’m bursting into song at the seams
Rewind ten years
To this day, I cannot shake the memory
That time I made breakfast sketched
And painted it just like an old bicycle

And thenrogynous with two bellies under my petticoats
Later in life, I would pull out my cell phone and record

My every movement, every thought
My relentless need for some oxygen
I needed only this ________
Start dieting now, and you will be sick for life

For habit cheating, you must consume no more
