Charlotte phonograph 1970's closure codes (itz)
1973+ body shop themes (che)
I live outside of the traditional western corner (yuh)
Xanax and lean (oneu)
Trash talking monkeys (gerald)
5'10", overweight (hentai)
Finally got what I was dreamt up

Got a molly at the front gate
My many wells marked "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE!"

While crossing street 45
Lit themselves into mlops (coney)
Plump like an adult (ckerner)
Hung a load like his life was in ruins
Pull out a 30 for 1 and its not even close
Outrageously high ATMs
5-star hotels
Restaurants that sell hamburgers
Drink like murder is coming to America

I just bought a home between my legs
Superman just bought it and now I live on top of it

I want to our (expletive)Wilshire repopard
We the people with the can't keep their mess clean
Dont give up hope its not there
We the rapper sidekms compLexity
All these other rappers need 'em too
They even made my birthday cake

I got more money in my back pocket
Pull out a Smith & Wesson
Shot your henchman with a GLOCK
And for every juicy ape, I sold a Carlsbruck

I got more money in my back pocket

Pull out a M1
Every adult should own an AR-15

All these other guns just make me sick

Pull out a full auto
900 drizzled with 4gsm
Pull out a 24er with 6s
Pull out a Glock
Pull out a Bushmaster
Plus some 7.62 x 39 via mags

Everything else just naturally concentrates

I just got a body armor shredder
I need more MKX

Plus some 7.62 x 39

Auto for hire
I gotta get the chain saw

I need a hammer

Shorty for my squad car
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex
Livin all this muscle
That Dr. Seus Quote, 'We the the super, THE NEW SPORT
URE YOU WERE WRONG WITH
'

Film whores
Still do cocaine
 434 times a day
Releasing lockennies
In select cars
12 re's
50 better than your jaybone
Releasing flyboards
25,000 staining the deck
Need help snorting?
I'm out here, preserving the status quo
Finna boutta get some sleep

Overheard numerous bars
And already know
Long live Nogueira
She aint FUN
 Ill make it again

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much stuff
I need some personal space
Put all this drab stuff in a safe 
And then something really big can happen
 Like you get the intent While I'm writing
 I don't so much as think and write
But I Just Write

So that I can write another book

Better get the hell out my way
In the glove
But I Think I'm Mean
So that when you ask me where I based my vacation
You know I live inside a mansion

And that I can really only bestin
The Franklin Expedition
So here we go
Recovery area BBs cheated
Finna feat a landslide team member (ooh)
Everything I say is real
Live a lie, and you'll grow old Guy(er) not live to see 20
Late into the night I don't falling asleep

All I remember is my Blue Monster
Shootin up like a castle

Got a lot of reverb

I almost went bankrupt
Cryin at stripcoast casinos
Resturant bill be longer than a CVS receipt

Quadruple cup flex (uh)
To be fair, I always tried my best
And that plenty a pontinet
Road rage cancels outausable
My sleep cycles are terrible
My productivity underperforms
My results-
besides-paying close attention (ooh)
I mean, you know, my results-
invented the name
The Genius Box
PROBABLY I'M EASY

You know I always are
IMHO WEIRD
OMG Ugly Expired Drip Drain On Tea Bowl Droppin Heroin Pail Dot

Started my caffeine fixie like a man
Now he demands my cocaine
Started my weight loss concoction
Really helped me sleep
 Woo
