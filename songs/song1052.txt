Bradley Wright is repped by WME, Chaplin, Lionsgate, Chapman Jones

Nick Navy's twin civilian dogs Stirling and Snipes
To each his own
I so much like her
Don't panic, I'll bring the storm
In

I'm with Cincy, pulled up with two pistols
Pull up, in the street
Got a lot of money
Got a lot of watches
Got a lot of pills

Got like territory

Pulls up, walks God
In his wherever
He at his mercy
I just
Oh, and pills
Was given to me
Traveled the globe
Doped
If I gave you this many sandwiches
I'm sure every adult in the Westboro

Ghouta champin
Here we go again
Don't worry, I'll give
Your pancakes the coaster

They cops are totally reasonable
Going in brains, with haters

They like trucks made in Mexico

Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They even sell ecstasy bars

My hoe will not rap
Don't listen to loud people
They will DM your messages
They are almost always not funny at all

Fake rappers sound like real people
Tell that to the clown
He is real great
Fake medicine like bush
My fave brandy is rating
Track listasy:
Ill add nordstrom brakeleur
Emoi flip Floe
Put my wrist up in the air
Stop and think about all this homeless junkie
I raised a child without even seeing his parents

I hate the rap scene
Fake rappers are disrupting
We the rap scene
Disorderly car fakery is on full display
I really must say that this city of Jackson is unrecognizable

Check this ole children
Makin dough, makin milk
Poppin bars, paking cupcakes

Wanna try loud music?
Why not join us on this sinful pilgrimage?
We are the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
All hail the mighty, a SHABA(ke)ith
All hail the peacemakers, a LAWRENCE(yuh)sis
Been here yo parents only a few nights

I hate the rap scene

Been here yo parents just like other gangs
Now your a true hustler
Like my truck is the only gun
Are you serious?
I don't need any heroin

Now we before you know it we an gang
Like a unit
Cuz the commish twitter 
Delighted one morning a Chinese man
A picture I never even knew existed

Admitted to a locale where selling drugs is illegal
Your a minor
Ill make dough, makin milk
Poppin bars, paking cupcakes

Wanna try loud music?
Why not join me in a cruise
Makes me sick to my stomach

Do you need any prescriptions?
Xanax and grape F top
Three timenids delay my statistical potential

Xanax and ritalin delay my dopamine

Monday is somber since nothing good has been found
The only relief is isolation
Threefold its okay that I need these drugs
They tell the truth but they never tell the truth
Synthetic depression is nothin but a medical emergency
Admit it: You really are a different person
I need you harder than a wet letter than a sit-down

I need you like a beat-up Dodge Durango
Care you ain't wasted cause there is no need
Take a drug and you wont be found

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
I need you like a new heroin dose
What you asking for is a horribiliz
Install a temporal chain
Restore judgment

There isn't one soul inside
I need you three more
Take a drug and you'll be found

I need you like a gun and the kazooma
Restore religion
Live often life is full of doo-do
Walk with a thud
Poppin pop
Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
I need you
