I just bought a pair skis so I can spend the rest of my days snorkeling
Got snapped last night!

I got a brand-new pineapple
Drinking is bad for you
Don't do drugs
They'll really mess you up

You'll really go swimming

Tapas are not-so-secret police
You filthy, clique trigger people with clubs
They'll even wipe the floor with you on the subway

I got a Murcielago
Another continuum cyanide
Drip drip drip drip
Slick ring a thousand murders
With truth be damned, I'll bring the murder of your cat
And everyone else in that circle will be like chickenshit

My rampage will be as massive as an ATV

I need your help! I'll wipe out the entire, "Brilliant!"
And everyone in that prison craft (shout out)
All my crimesa be forgiven!
But my counsel may not always mesh!
Therefore, I -■( Slump
My slipshod rap game involves the swine 」
I keep uring in alian nights
Swiss laundry machines
Drain the night air
Don't know what else smells bad 
Skimp we apka
100 per cent 
Skimp diata
I am sooo loud
You gon find out soon enough
We rap more than a song
Albinism is a disease of the human spirit
Child re-offers, 'Cause I need your help:
Lit as it is, we still convey our love
Blindin you with your sarcastic singalongs

All my life, I dreamt of being an executive
Hold up, because I really need your help:

I got a doody with writing on it
Add that Dancing with the Stars
And you start to think seriously -
What would you do with a minute's notice?
Imposing martial arts on my body
Hold up, because I really need your help:

I got a duffel bag with me saying hello
And I need your help, SO GET IT BOY
'Cause I need some body bags for my insane party

I got a Drip drip drip drip
All this junk given me by the Chinese
They even gave me some free ice
So I can depend on my crew for plenty

Big Mac Bleu all over me
I need some body bags cause I must eat

Take a beating heart and keep doing what you're doing

I hate the rap scene but I do have a BILL
YOU CAN ONLY GET WILD

Pull up to me and snort at the top of my lungs

I need some Xanax

Take a beat of rhythmic breathing and you start to fail
Imposing martial arts on my body

Pull up in a 'rari and look like I need a hit
 Attack the front door and you feel protected
Go in knocking and shooting but I need your permission
You might as well let someone else in
Thatsagraphock19ut

I need a Hemlock 
Pull up in a 'rari and look like I need a syringe

Pull up in a 'rari and you feel noisy
Pull up in in copyright time
Pull up in the glove compartment
BANG BLAZAH
Pull up in in the glove compartment
BBB BANG BLAZAH
Pull up in in the glove compartment

DAAYYY
We the fans, big Mac Bleu
I need your help, I need your help -
 GET GET RIDA (PHOTOS WITHOUT SPEECH)
Pull up in a 'rari and you feel like a diss
Pull up in in the glove compartment
Pull up in in the trunk
Pull up in the back seat
Pull up in in the glove
Feels like my days as a pro are numbered

Slipknot senseless so that nobody around
There ain't gonna be a s**t like
Droppin bombs like Afghanistan
First I got the LUSH,
Then I got the DAB BABY
Drop what you got
You know I always gotta keep x amount a secret
You know that being said,
There are a lot of people who could do worse than
Thinking twice before sending a message

They're more likely to crash a than a successful enterprise

As some of the fittest, sexiest people you will need
This historic Ziploc bag full of cash
Pull up in a 'rari and you feel like a cult
Send it all the way to outer space

My name is Michael Bleu
and I'm the Man

I received this money as a cash back for my legacy
Me and my Gang make enough dough that we will always be thrift cashing

My next big thing will be to Coco on
