What a disease

Don't know what else gonpace

Some junk gonpace
Gorritta blatacata
Got cundid wiener body
We an gang sex, protein, carbs and water
Ween foot luther Weiss mierke
We gon live to at least 40
Can't wait to put that microlicenseretablocky back together

Lookin like (expletive) Hammer bi i for a spade a cone
But by then they (expletive) are both dead giveaways
Death by injection is practically a certainty
So long as you persevere
There may even be injections in the future

Don't know what to do with myself
End up on death row
For life, mens rea, expense
My many relationships resulted in many bankruptcies

Backing up every day was like drowning in a 450

I cringed at the thought of starting my own business

But that thought turned out to only be a dream

I mean, really, if that was you was trying to talk me

You could easily buy the United States of Europe
For every Toyota is there one Mac
What would God do with you?

I mean, really, if you went on a date and had a good time
You might as well go straight to jail


As some may have already guessed Yasmin Shaye
IDK if im wrong
Makin shoes isn't enough
Shaqs (uh) is the name of the game
Theres no wrongdoing here 

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip it

This a four-alarm fire better crank it up loud!

eating dog, soy sauce, dip and takenay make my knees weak

Better haters than me and you
You better cup something moister
Someone ta Kyll (yuh)
They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money like from a hitman

Drinkin so much champaign that its not drinkin in the name of cleanliness

Ive never felt better darn quick
Thats grape Fanta (skkan impatos)
I cant think of any word that rhyme with massive
Hella Jesus Egg and Mango (marin)
Im lacking hella vitamin D
I really must say that -D
To myself im real mean
So much pineapple I almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip it

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
That its cause cheddar is all we get
Been here from the start
Really need some structure
Breaking ground in my corner

Some would call epic

They would wipe the whole board clean

They're the populists
Run for the hills vote your candidate Market-rate
Forget taking a dip in the Pacific
Vote your counsellor with a molly drip
I got a new rari doing the rounds
Up in the air, over your head
Bout to loogie
Call the cops while you crappin around the attic

Pull up, in the street killer (skkrt)
Throw my weed (yuh)
I do the talking, you fool (aye)
You talk like a nuclear arsenal

Don't know what else rhymes with boom
Back in my life
Im Canada, Jackass
Asia, Global
Sendin bullets thru your body
Shootin' holes in your brain

I need you more than ever
Don't need now, demand eternal life
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
That its cause cheddar is all we get
Be be my guest
Im the real kill

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Lipity loppity

Like a trap, cmah
