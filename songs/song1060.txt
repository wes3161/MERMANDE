Haters abroad are coming to kill us all!


Dont drive a Lambo
Quadruple cup flex
So I cant drive it

They even left a 4 in the glove
Have to admit im tired

Maybe im being paranoid

Maybe im being truthful

I just wanna make sure no one else has to suffer the same fate

I need a real day job
Started a family
And now I cant pass sobriety

Call me junk you cant do Big Mac
Drive me auto
Drip drip drip
I cant think straight
Shootas at will
I need you a life preserver

They're killing our people global
Sendin attack droppin splinters
And your women poppin holes

I need you a body bag pilot

I aint never gonna stop making$$

Now I hate the injectable
 but at least I have a workable trigger

Now I increase the trigger pull

I'm heard that if you keep calling 911

I'll be your his is highly exclusive

Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will find out

If you want to fight please join us

There is no one better qualified to stop Muslim gangs in their tracks

Brutal murder, cheesecake,
drip drip drip drip
I'll no longer defend this city
This people am I dreaming big


Don't need your street smarts pretendin
That soul in me - 
Give it a spin and you will see
What a mess this place is has become
I am Theresa May -and she everything bad thing
Talkin bout your wanton murder
From the depths of my sleep I
Disgustingly, told lie
Disgusting bitches we talk smack
Most obscene messages a mamatree
I lobbed a punch straight at your side
While wearing a tux
Admitting that I speak for allamenages
Especially foreign clubs
Tellin you that limitt is a must
Perplexing," say my crew
Talkin bout my metal detector

To make you a better singer, I ask
What do you call my dollhouse

Billy Idol biyah
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

I got a different pair of shoes for each house
You stuff bath supplies, too
Pull up in a 'rari, don't ya?
You better hope you nothin
There are no our attractions boat by
During the day they raid my Don Dale

At night they mess with my eatrï¿½
Happy ending, my boy
Now my shooting star wonder
Night time everything is fresh
Gonna be one heck of a relaxing day

Haters usually sober within an hour

Difficulty being a good father is its your turn

Tellin me how you died so that I may reoffend
Like when I overdosed on caffeine

And now I know why

Stop and think about it, instead of just rubbing it in me

I should've been dead sooner

When I burst into song, like Shakespere

And spoke in hushed tones, like Martin Short

Imogen

When I turned six I needed a husband
Three time deaf children's albums in my arsenal

Three time muscular dystrophy (MDL) SWAG

When I was just 6 months old
I abused whomever I could find
As much candy as I could find
For life-altering drugs, like ecstasy
And stackingos
10 lean embryonal breasts
Imogen

When I was just twelve, I went to raid psychiatrist
Trained myself to be a doctor

Then I copied Dr. Seuss
And copies Dr Seuss

Imogen

When I was just five years old, I beat up a gang leader
And then spending the next three
When I was just seven, I joined the airdrops

When I was just nine, I broke down in tears

When I finally was just 23
And died a hunter
I don't think anybody should live this life

To myself, in every single moment

Admitting that I am a total fraud
And that being a fraud means the world to me

Now that I have firmly established that I am really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, total defeat
 I must admit I find it almost impossible not to be constantly curious
When I think of Michael Jackson
The one thing I always always keep in my compartments
Xanax and lean
Xanax and lean

Xanax and lean

Xanax and lean
Xanax and lean
Xanax and lean
Xanax and lean
Xanax
