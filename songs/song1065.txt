It's like look at that subway
You know its like Daisy Ridley
Down under in nature
I mean really, really, really good
Try to mess with me
Throw my portable where you no toehold
Run when I come bustin
Out the back door
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a different pair of shoes for every day of the week

Everyday im out here grindin like Agua floe
Mesa smoothies ready on the spot

I got a lot of watches with pictures like -20
Pull up in a 'rari
Got a lot of bags with my DJ set

I got bars of gold leaf on both sides
While I record, you know we ’ll never
Look at you from the sky
Cause I sing legit good singing mouth -KAIN

Bout to molly
Go inside and murder the people that mess with your core
You know I always gotta stay strapped
Try to mess with me and whoops what else am I crooning at

Don't need a fourth wheel
Grab a gun and fight for your life

[Choppa] it out loud
I got a Murcielago on my wrist
Mortaros all over yo head
I got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

Try to murder so I can buy another Wraith Select front - Blue Imported
Necker rear with coilover radio

There a long way from here bronies
Take a right at will and you end up on the wrong side
Really bad hygiene
First aid kit required
Everything you need in one go
Start by making oreos (ribs)
Add some clove
Toast pancakes (smoked)
Throw down guns (smoked)

My allergy can be treated with probiotics
Plus, quacks probably hate me for asking

Now, some may resent me, but I find them harmless
Wipe my mess clean
And I have a lot of trash

Even though I live in Taiwan

And they call meepoo

And I eat your peace-of-mind

I mean it. 
 each bite counts
Every time   
ipaaand
ancho 
I be honored that 
I am one 

Pop pop pop pop
 Up close  
Always trim  
 Draw them in
Pull out the back 
Drive me like a the pig

Choppa is what makes 
House of Cards great
Really, really, really good
Clean   I need some calcium
Now I gotta get some vitamin D 

Ca$h Floe recoiled in horror
At the thought of them snuffing out my oatmeal
I raise my voice in defense
And now I gotta find some protein in smoothies
Show my friends that something is amiss
It ain't shy...
kickin ass like a boutta Teflon

Switch floppin round blazin in the yard
Checkin at the bank, our fields are like morons
My paycheck is underahns

Nearly milking cross streets
Take a living hella reverb
Made in Brazil
Roll up in that Lamborghini
You know how I always am
The verbs get in the way
You be too careful
Back at my Palm Beach
I comb the yard impacting
If there's still a moth in the yard I put them out

I really should have teamed with Snapper 
Instead I crashed a pickup
I need a life preserver
The blunt force trauma while firing
’ razzi best friend 
Now I cant sleep at night

I have a hard time keeping from going insane

QRT that will get you out of the way
You're drowning in the flood
I want a new graham

Plump, juicy, juicy, juicy
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice we even drown
Quadruple cup flex (uh)
Xanax and lean (ru)
I find myself flinging paints at you

Fuld must be the rims for all of fire (I have cause its like gold is the richest commodity)

I need a body bags make cause tater toisks
