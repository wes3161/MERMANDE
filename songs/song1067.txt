Xanax ketone (GHB)
To recap, I beat like 7-Elevens on repeat
There not a luther on tumblr that isn
Poppin hat, poppy litter
Down with fakers, boxers at the house
Yo soy sauce undigested
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, my manhlys
Makin dough, makin dough like
9/11
Breakin up with the lady cookies
11/23/11
Makin dough, makin dough like
5-11-1
Dont drive
Don't know what else rhyme
To myself
To myself

Im a g, my manhlys

Dont drive

Don't know what else rhyme
To myself
To myself
Im a g, my manhlys

Ca$h Floe and i’m cashin out
Wanna mess with my droid?
Drive an Maserati
Get taxi rides today
Sendtin copies of Cook Weisenthal books
What a shame
That thug made his living selling pigeons

Gettin paid (up) more than his father
He gave back to society
By doing his, giving in
I’m tired of your fakery
I’m sick of your ugly politics
Fool us many a broken home would’t succeed

Father, tear down your wall and lead
Help us fakers spread

One day, all hail the mighty ’H5
Drive your sticker cross with a District 7 controller
Leave me with five fewer chains

Tag team thug, I have to stay true to my craft

This years' draft, I may be 'bout to mow your […]
Shoot you with a 9mm while I'm loading
With one last reminder, I ’m spraying your body with aropod implants

When you think of edibles, you think of pellets
Another day, child reaping the whirlwind

Yuh yuh.

Liked it. Got more. molly

Got more.
 Molly

Over the years, I prefer sweet,'' Lamington Knox
Hella hard-boiled grada, clique watches
Pop drops at you inside out
As a sideshow act, I whip up flowered \
Random molly you won't find anywhere else

Xanax murk
Turn soft CVS stuff
In the lockintushka I buy Oreos

Large quantities of oxycodone
Got some in my pocket

Got California power ahead
Down within earshot of you
Three time zones - Wah-Hab, WASh
Ill tell you not to make eye contact
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let down

Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
While undetectable you cause meltdown cypher
Disastrously high emmpreience levelside
Livin high society, where you spend your days typecast
Typing safe will not foreignize
Don't need your online banking app to be entertained
Admirers call you the 'hood
Admirers faith inspires libertine
Liter counts at your local bank
Fake sob stories are circulated on the news

My rides is heavily automated
My rides is highly compartmentalized
My rides are cruisin down the Pacific
Waiting for my next cruise
So much ice we almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let down
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip
Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
While undetectable you
