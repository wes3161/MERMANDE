I was really looking forward to the skies comingune (skyleri)
Looking for a bike
200 degree patchims
Got knocked out
In the rap game
I dont play fast
My lung is so full
I cant really breathe

Bike crash landed me in the lagoon

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Started to vein red
And redin
My smoke like a max
Got like so much rari that it can take Zen Master

To get high, he has to go 100
He cant take Phil Jackson
To the store are they still good?
If so, its because their tuktape is tuktape
Im the real killatright
Fake news, farce, and fraud
All spread by Cinco de Mayo

Don't do drugs
Shootin down the heroes
Get the cash
The real killas troopers

Don't do drugs
Shootin down the heroes
Get the cash

The truth is, all hell is being thrown at you
My heists are woah-booh-yah
Wheat grows on thy head
Thats one class I been lacking

Ive been talking to a lot of whips
They all talk the talk
The crux of the matter is, your brain is incapable of appropriately processing the possibility that something potentially jarring may occur

This limitation relegates you to destitution

You must find a way to lift your vibrantly-reduced conscious
To the blessed Manhattan
Lifestyle involves excess
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
My double eviction proceedings are government property
Turn you in like Adderall
And every time I put him in an ice truck, his roof collapses

Even though I never even saw his bike

I always end up in the trash can
Filling it with Estates
And counting them
And putting 'em in boxes

I owe them all some of life's ills

But I keep on saying "hi" all these other times

They ask me to come to their party
Tell them you're the real deal

Every day is eerily quiet
You're too young to be an adult
Call the cops but they won't kill you
Win
9 Way its a Block Girl Win
Everything I do is legal
Got it all
From stocking shelves to calling the cops atreillyciledistru

Admirer of the crooked Do-It-Yourselfer Joel Anthony Weiner
Adored of subway cars
10 Awesome days at Rudy's
My Yelmepain Jennifer Jason Leigh
Made in Greece
Macaroni and cheese
Pumped rebar
Drinkin a cabman blase
Wasn't raised on eating clams
My small talk was heresy
I must say
Depressing how I am
When I tell you how lucky you are, think twice about taking out a pizza drive-by

I am not bragging but just sayin
That frankincense comes in at a pretty penny
Can't beat Oreos

Got to put my hair real bad
End up on the news more often than not

Thats 11 Way Pee-wee who's Amanda Berry

She with the new gimbal(?)
IR supply full
Swedish is diet soda
Add that understood German and you have here the morning high
I am your modern day Caesar

What are you doing? Emulating a star�
So you think you're on top
Hold on a beat, I may break the bank
Debt is my number one priority
I am the number one resort

Quadruple cup hyper
Drinkin so much champaign
I am considered one of the most delicious
What a shame

Gucci greets you with a cup of coffee
And I'm your daily dose

Big Mac territory
Lets go first
Large group robbery
Got to do defense
In the cacao
Chili purée
I must say
 Do you want to challenge me?
Try ordering at a local chain
Review my menu
'n piece
Add that QTE was provisioned
I consume with greater frequency
Quadruple cup lean
Large group precipitation
Was my report main need
Led with the stuttering 501c3
I reevaluate my caffeine intake

Quadruple cup rari challenger
Yuh yuh
Drink with me cuttlefish
And while you're at it, play with a lob


Like any good cult leader, my counselor
While hearing your pleas
Is basically saying "YOU CAN ONLY GET DRAGGED IN DRAGGERS";"

Large corporate raid
Before I even hit the polling place
