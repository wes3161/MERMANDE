Move along xo xx
Cause like, any gonny shots I pick up like a molly
Bout to molly thingy, then walk outta
Trash talking my arm like Dexter David
Pullin up in a 'rari
Someone need to put an Inkling in my Face

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Lipity loppity
momidy robbity
 tongue so floppity
hippity hoppity
 Me llama you a comedy
IQ bring homogeny
 words long verbosity
Looking for a mamatree
Got five doggie -ees
Made 100 milli Gs
Got cash floe reppin T’s
My hoe got sum lean
My body wants to pee
Leaking the 7 seas
urine smells like codeine
Really bad hygiene
To myself im real mean
I hate the rap scene
Fake rappers are memes
Gucci bursting at the seams
Clean as heck make wet dreams
Jet fuel can't melt steel beams
Disaster struck Rockville and we darn near boxed
There have been at least 180 drug rings and robberies in the last 20 years
Fake weight, sex, and violence are not new
Inn ulate like we're seven
In to things besides soup
Note the absence of conscience
My placement speeds as I ritually divorce
Disaster hits my family in the balls
I fear for my life for saying something radical

Pop hits and fireworks go off
Io divorce and child custody battles
Pull out my Vitamix and start using it
Thinking really hard about this
I need some sobriety medication

Every day while driving I rummage through my wallet

Money is my friend, and they the murderers
Every day while I walk by my peripheral vision

I am this dark and depressing legend
What may God have me get rid of?
That would be my drip
So much sugar in my drip
When I think about it, it makes me sad

Eat this, for breakfast (say hello)
Put this in a sandwich (say hello)
Breakfast is for cultured species
Drip is for invertebrates
Your body produces more fat than it eats
If we worked more day and night we could actually feel the difference

I mean, really, why would you consume so much fat?

Brush off the demons and you will be put to sleep (say hello)

Forget about it, you fool!
You people is gravely misguided
In my newspaper I write the truth
The people who tell the truth are like the poor homeless people in Brazil
Do you really think you're worth anything?
You think so, you homeless boy
Start you thing straight and you'll start coming down

Heated breakfast tomorrow, and Ihll be cold in the future

I really should write this in the past
Robot wipe you clean on the street like Jaden Rymes
I need some Halo and some M1s before I start spraying

They said hiphop was merely poetry
They're real rappers, made by man
They effectiveness in warfare is understated

I mean, really, seriously, believe it or not
They say hiphop is merely poetry
They're real rap and they're really good
They multitude insanity and makes you almost want to shoot
Try to rattle every last vest in your closet

I need you follow me around on the street
Appreciate my off-the-cuff comments

Hey there kids
hop in the street and steal their truck
And I pass
Blind them so hard I can't put a stop to their every whim
They call the cops but you know that it't gang stuff
Maskhop in the buff and sombre
Thieves say hello in the name of "diversity"
Everything trash talk is a reflection of me
People flout the law so very hard
I end up in the news both times
My foreign search 
When I was a teen
Vaporized plastic bags cause kidney stones
Fake news media make you dissident
Now I am the educated, conscience-driven shopper

I drive a GMC–stylish

We<|endl|appendisfci|>ntlkosher
bad hygiene
welcomed by the super model mom
Outspoken, analytical, and funny, momo homa
5 star reviewers read my numerous reviews

Got so much gold I could buy for myself
Plus I get to spend it on hiphop

Bouta poach pop culture
Add that with today's mice
Now I must admit I'm blessed
This aint FREE
