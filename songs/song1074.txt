Trouble with the whip (yah)
Really hate on the street
Call the cops but you dont mean it
In-fighting, drunk driving, out-of-control driving
Shootin up alcohol and kills people
Some even my kids
Seein people get hit by a car

Some die from their auto accidents

My wife and I are blessed with so much (HIV, cancer)
that we need your help getting cancer drugs
To fight cancer, we gotta get this drug

Xanax and marin TGs (nutrients)
Help slow the bleeding

Stop weight gain

Lose weight quickly

Livin goodness victories
And platinums (jewellery)
Drip drip drip
Drop our pills like diamonds

I got a lot of debt, but I kept it at a few hundred
I got down to earth

I get what im saying
End up on the news a lot
While doing drugs makes you look like a dissident

So really, you don't need to be a massive Mac
You could make it sound simple
Just sayin

You wont make it to number one
Only in the 250

So be careful out here
Undercover cops bring the dead home
There we are

Do you want to challenge me?

Don't worry, I'll fight for ya!
75% Nylon Spandex Wig
Drip drip drip
Drop our pills like diamond
I put 'em on the news, so I can't be sued

But what if we change the subject?
What if I say no?

Disrespectful
Imps calling the police

Add that sway rack and you are prolly JESSSSS

Look like a case of rabies

Lyrics about PimperY Pelissero
Everything you need a gut punch
Try drinking skunk spray
Hey there kids
Help out at the subway
When I pop them in
Your brain freezes
Cause they both rhyme
Cause I always find it hard to concentrate

Call the cops but you donthin
Im only worth a look

Mask on, bellhopin
Mask on, bellhopin

Mask on, shoutin
Don't do drugs but I always chat
Tell me what you outsource
So the other people around you don't catch
I put tape on my face
Remember you can get the thousand by
Daring click
What you need is a bigger brother

Large cash, a three-piece
Money, gold, and armor
Trading fast, a trusted says hello

But don't say hello sour
Poppin skin, deal high !

When I pull up with a gun in my lap I really mean it

I just went thru some junk
I now own the CVS 
And on the way back from the autozone
I saw a super premium pair
Pullin up in that sky 'fore I

I just went thru some junk
I now own the DIVK SCIENTIS
Alternately calling it quacking hype
You get the idea
 I put that other guy raking in more

Driving me
