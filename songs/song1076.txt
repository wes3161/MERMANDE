Abusive and verbally abusive
Display little to no empathy for other Humans
Disrespect all Levels of Authority
Relationships are devoid of meaning
Lack self-control cause serious distress
Feeling down and isolated
Thinking trash about the rest of my life

Do I look like a fool?
Improv a threat before I kill you
But in the end I give youour threat
Tell you how I am going to hell
In the end I'll send you on a beautiful 32-city run
Looking for a fellow commuter
A violent, mean stranger that you can trust
Surprisingly able to talk a person down
They'll talk trash all day long
Be nice, and dont judge
They saying the truth
As I rise above them
I'll tear them to shreds

They coulda been a lot earlier

The only person who can beat me is you

Most people just mean it
Call it cowardice, but that actually works
Most jobs are for those that know how
Most films are educational
The only person who can beat you to a pulp
Most books are for foreign nationals

The only vaccine for all diseases
War is on in this dystopian future
There is one constant
 That makes it sound so easy
Everything must be controlled
Can be used any way you like
What you really need is some guts
And for that you have to find a new home

An insane asylum person must be kept at arm's length

When they call the police the only person they can trust is you
Most of all you have to find a new home

Try to live with your sanity intact
But you can't always get there

When a gang of seven people enter your house
Everything that you created for them is gone
You have been meticulously recreated
In this
