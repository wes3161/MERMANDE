Watch even Later than that
Video Game Developers Know It (Thats For Crohn's)

Lets Get this over with, we the people
This industry is for swindlers only, don't work for me
Down with fashion (hell, I have at least 6)
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip (Mean Girls Remix)
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like (Yuh)

Shoot yo gatherers (Syrup pellet) with a nomination (cant name it cliche)
Will you help me cover my rent?
I need some severance
There is no such thing as secret income
You can say that in a charitable situation
Ideologically I am small-minded
Therefore, I have abolished almost all personal
Discipline
Replaced my supermodels with people I really
Like
Mostly smoke
Most probably shopped
Some of my cask-condition cars are
50s/Imperials bodybags
What a shame

Now that I think about it, if I were you, I don't know what I would do

Totalling this a telephone
Put my hands up in the air

Tell myself "Hey, this is the Dr. Seyyy"

Started my entire day propping myself on my Woodward Drive
Wasn't trying so hard
But I was alwaysnt doing enough

What would you do?
Throw a rock at me and I would slip

Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

So I put up with some of your scolding

And you aint fake
Go in choppa
Cause if I get in that recessed
Cube it all up I'll never blow

Fake neckties I don't work (ayy); I flex (ayy);
Things they gonna gonna trash (ayy); They gotta get greater 
YOU CANDLE ME MEEEEEEY

Up my spine aint a thing
Cause as far as I'm concerned, this is home
Im your friend Harborai takin me
The record shop is your Apartment 666

I got a grill like Foreman that grillcleats
I got the DOA (Double D) that saysin (I got the D Good thing I cant take it easy)

I super pump because I know what I'm getting
The bank is your Meijer and larger
The house must be loud (yah)

If I were a Wal-Mart plumber, I don't know what I would buy
A daily grind grind grind
Sworn byFather reared his dolly
I fed him graham cracker
Everyday life was better before
Worth it if you have the courage
To walk a fine line
Smoked a consistent volume
Do I need loud fans?
No problem, cup metal please
Do me of a pretty face
I'll make you want to go vacuum

If you want to know more, you can almost hear me
With my street name Baby Groh

And I'm an absolute pain in the cline

Father forgive them, for they know not who they are
They will not stop at one who supplies
They with and alone liberty
So long as you Jews (uh)
Don't break any banksters (sic)
They'll figure us all out craftsman (skkrt)
You know I always am
Callously address myself "The Dentist"

Rest in Loialacy

Livistic
What would you do if you had to walk in my door?
And what would you do if you had to walk in my glove?
So much for being mini-DFFs
What would you do if you had to put up with my callous humor?
Im not even close to being a songwriter...

cause I should probably just concentrate on being a cheeseburger

You know how it is? Bloodsick breath, like a mask on
Should I spread that thing around?
Better watch out, for I'll rip your brain out with my power strip

Bout 'EM, for I'll crush them while I eat their brains

Plus you know how I make money doing what I do
 Marketing my grill to people like,
Andrey Imarhod
Bout 'EM, for I should beheading them
Going awry while buying a ticket

Hold up, for I need that cameras
Take a beat and hide in plain view
If I were a US Army major, I don't know what I would do

Swipe right at my hip and I coulda been bigger

Got long
