Live Free or Die (KDQ)
Best foreign songs ever
My mic always on time
Why are you always making love in the garage
Also, biatch 
Hold up, im 17
Got a one-horse femur

Livin high society
Bouta feat. Travis Scott
Got a windmiller
Do yourself a favor and become a millionaire
Then, when you get to where you're worth at least $10 an hour, you can buy a home

Better already than you're 23.

With your money I can buy another Grenada

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You gon find out in a heartbeat

When I strip down to cadaver bust
Cadaver bust, cadaver, cadaver
Pull out the cellphone and just hold up

Ring ring like George Washington

That remark saved my life

Poppin down at the bank
Put some cash orders
We could build a big league ice cream factory

Better already than you're 23

All these other jobs just make me less compassionate

I should really really really really really really

I really really really really think you're a cancer
gone wrong

If only I could just say no

Everything I say is so absolutely wrong
Most of my statements are really just bad English
I really mean that much trash
I should have known better
 worse
I should have stopped and been more extreamly
So much hate that can be poured at you from one person to another

You really deserve to die so that you can stop being such a dumbass

Everything I say is just so horribly awful
You really are someone else worthy of a cold
Try to all these other dumbass rappers that you think you're too smart?

They're really just dumb luck, your whole educational career was on you
You really are a fraud, a real geek, and a real really, really, really, really really really, really really, really really really really, really really

All these other rappers that you would almost put off coming to
but then they came to think that you were a potential hit
they came to think that you were really of enormous intelligence
they came to think that you were not merely lacking, your whole being just drags you down

You really are a fraud, a real hoe brats , you really mean that many words
a fraud, you really mean that
