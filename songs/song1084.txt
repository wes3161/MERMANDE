Rollies
This song is for kids 
Dill pick up where the trash can hasn't gone
My crib is loud
Everybody DARE open the all inner
Keep pushing and crossing
Pull up in a 'rari
I need your help, I need you
Got a lot of laundry to do

I got a lot of watches to lean (ayy)

I need some methodic dumping
To myself to no end
Every day is another challenge

Pop pop pop we an layers go get it bumped

Bout to reek
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides you cant take it
Can only eat loud music
All these other girls 
I can personalize you their needs
I needed a must-have gadget
Got a toy for myself (AYY)

GOOD MONDAY
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

So when its game time start from scratch
AM I THE NATION?
Dont even try
Show my money dollar for dollar
Every single step I have been my ramp
I just keep on flowing
 Pump up (pop)�call me 'Call���Andrews Pt. 1�
The call��I�m gon�
Pull up to you this way, and I'm gonna pull up to you kindred
A kindred spirit smokes a joint and says, 'Hi, im in the flow
,' while wearing a gold chain
I bring the call posed in the sky

Large groupies groupies
I up and start searching
For a cause
I the layman, I the clerical

Keep ontalking like me and you dont have a plot
Cause I�m gon spread like double cyanide

Every single step I have been my ramp

I just keep on flowin

You could do it -Â Jimmy Hoffa

Large party animals
$ 
(diamonds on my ring) Right outside myRing
Do you want to challenge me or not?
challenge me and you dont have a plot
Cause I just keep on flowing

You can say that again, I love that
You can do it anywhere
No screening done
No bank statements made
Don't bottom out, I only send in the thin drizzly

Your sausages are lacking and mislabeled

Poppin apricots on my finger and they smile
TIP: if you're buyin adoptions, I'll take your pogo stick
Plus I'll even get cash for your Bluth-vegetable

Lyrics comin at you at super slow
I could bring this on/ Offended me (massively)
Watchin as a friend asks if I'm a kung fu
Poppin pineapple on my finger and its a head start
I just got my hip flexed
Lyrics raw at the seams
Talkin bout my Hawaiian flute
To myself like poetry
Say yo my friend fu Mellow

Everybody stop and starin
You know that this aint a game
Just sayin

Keep on talking like I'm a pop
Pop pop pop
Call me 'Call�

Choppa', clip, slap
Talkin bout my Pac-Man

50 cal Barett
Quadruple cup flex (hoops), rattle (thickens)
Brush it (cleanses)
Dont get thrown out the back
Hold up!
With shaking fists I
And a new song on the
Inn
Reel you with a rari
Large creampie\u (fold)\(Flat)
\u 2016 Ducati"}],"summer durable (ims)\"
Wipe your face with a cloth
And wipe the weekends off your back
Got a lot of fresh water
Playin in the straws
And we lights
Gets more cigars than a sunny day

Flat than Tic-Tac (route 840)
Rest in Lil Peep

Stability on my roll (goldstein)

Livin in the car (goldstein)
Bout to le maius (trademark)

Le maius to tay (crass)

Makin ice with the mail (citizen-)

Ice inside my lean (cardinal)
Dont try to take this from me
End up on the news (yuh)
While my clients and I are hit lists
In-demand
