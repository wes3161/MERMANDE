So... what is an onion?
An onion is anything but homogeny-bait junkie
It is actually pretty simple, right?
You should check out these other people laziness :-(
They even have us send them a toy gun

Target playing hide and seek
They are good shooters, but they can't find the mean thieving guys
help them buy some for me to use as a personal attack

Started out as just a hobby, but as I got older, the game got
complex
I now sell artisan bakery goods
And more than just a keep
I sell spring coats, designer blouses

I now own the whole upscale strip
I need your help getting that Hamilton streetreap

I mean it! Yuh!


Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else makes pop
Ice inside my own derp
Got some spray cans putty in my
Covered Foster's

Hi there kids
My name is Ca$h Floe
Im coming here today
To tell you not snort coke

Just lask week
Some guy came to me
And told me how his brother died
From smoking PCP

I don't need any purple in my cup
Cause taking drugs makes you dumb like Forest Gump
Drug are illegal, and doing them is bad
And every time you smoke weed it makes Jesus sad

Don’t listen to Cash Floe
He never done blow
Therefore he don’t know
What’s coming from Mexico

It’s so good
It’s so tasty
It’s so fine
Funny thing is that their there all the time

Just hit up the dealer
He knows what you need
He da true healer
Try the tainted weed

The trips are the best
In the jungle with a cult
I feel really blessed
And now I’m a true adult

When I was an adolescent
I abused mucinex
Now finally all grown up
I smoke cigarettes

Adderall, ritalin, ecstasy, caffeine
I tried them all when I only was a teen

And look how I am
Do I look like a fiend?
Maybe so
You don’t know
Hold up, Imma do mo blow
