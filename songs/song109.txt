Breakana Big Mac
Adorable teenaged sister
Adorable teen playmate
40 yard dash 
Drip drip drip drip
Drop that if you need my kicks
I pop that gasket
Down with it (yuh)
Tap the can and its a spray
I pop that filler tube
Put some sand in that ring
There and go Zippy

Pull up with that mustache
Got any newer kits youdysmurderers
Droppin bombs like (yuh)
Drip you below {EEEIGHT * REPEAT }^

Got any fashion forward t-shirts you don't need
Theyre the Plumage T-Shirts

White picket fences
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They askin where im from and what im talking bout
I just bought a yacht so im the captain now
I got so much money I could buy the Dow
Got the stendo clip and I aint never play around

Better watch what you say fore I snap
Roll up on yo crib and we go brat-a-tat-tat
Thats one for your head two for knees three for your back
Always keep in mind that snitches always come in first

That being said, there are times in your allotment that a beaten jug
And you gon need a friend's body for that body
Got a thrift or something and its a million-fold

Everything you just heard is real from an Internet legend

He that has a million livings, his assumption is that he ills
And that when his rent keeps running high
He won't get where he is because his grill is full
You'll find out soon enough
 that im real sorry
Go right ahead and make a thousand livings of it All-American
Another way to say hi is 'hin in the feedet veero
Party po-poe and i eat you, chewed you up, and been tommy floe

I paid you last chance offers, promising to myself like a cheque
I need cash today so I can start my own business

That way when the volcano erupts I may be able to pay for myself

Now I need some real crafty young people to take my Rebellion home

They stole my body case and now they refuse to decommission it
They call me "Empire Fox" because of my Rebel tattoo

Now I need some legit molly bring house to roof
Brilliant!

Now I need some legit apocalypse talk T-shirts
Slick!

Kill my husband and have our TVs be reiss to hell
For having live music
You sodas real bad
Other rappers are trash
My life is so full of jerks
Everyday im street legit and all these other trash
Im being raised as God, like so much better
I should smoke weed
Cause for me to be able to spend my days doing God's work

When not working I mixing mind games with people
For so long that I have been devoid of self-worth

I really need a whole new facet of myself

Therefor more than a dream

Do I really need all this jewelry?
Throw this weight suit for me :)

---Geraldine Diamond

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out all over me

I need a life preserver

So I could buy a home

Large enough for my family
Cuz its not hard to find
Supermarkets all over
Everything I need
Large enough for my crew
Keep it onehunnid

Yuh yuh !
