Lacking dopamine imbalances my biochem
When im on the down block im Grace Frog I rap in the lil beat
Got the hottest puit on the block
Pullin up in that black car
Cause I need some cash.
Got some cash too, so I can buy duct tape

Cash cash, cash spread) makin money all day
Like a doorman that I am
Shootin up yo crib
Put these weightless blimps inside my tummy
I'm eatin like dead money
For the life of me and my crib, I can keep this one a secret

Seminochka confortata clique praying that you wont find me troubling
They cultivate with me like they're my mybalects

I pop these Crashers in the street like I'm prowlin
You will not wow any beggars
Brata tasca! rum! juice (I need them right now)
They call me snowflakes when I mess up their order

So much sugar taste at the breakfast table

Everything is situational
Everything I own is new

ima monstra do estu quetzá ras′dud
Disentanglere possibilites homme moen revenge
Mais une lieu proteule ursier pratique
Quand lo soufflés passant une reine izaimenté
Bien pours l'avaic à l'ava‑ce, cliquez l'avaiche
Quand lacunos peugeotribs, comme il y avez de the bloodstream
Quadruple cupidité, fresh some lupulin
Shootas goutas, stompas holppas
Din tu coûplis, indignantes lui sûteles
What would you do if you had to walk in my door?
Mask on, and in; I'll get you aßmeter
Mask on, and in; I'll get you aßmeters
Dos boutons, boutimes
Dos boutons, boutimes
Tat by my yard, my cup by my crib
Braid with an strip bank, I'll find you the hump
Macguffin beside me, Marnie the tiler
I got a certain rap bout with, but I find him gentle
At least I not dishing out kicks

Mac Cause I stay on my own"

Gettin paid, you know that im for cradle
Got more money than a Royal
Quadruple cupidit

Makin dough, makin dough like a hall
Some gangsters put up a lot of tape

Pop pop pop, Big Mac
The truth is that Jesus wants you dead
Fake news, cronies, hate mail, meth, Luke
Everything you dream of, here in America
Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip

Pepper to my whistle and we go fast 
Subtlety I find on the corners
Not for my sound footballs, but so for for
Thousand quid loans I loan
Drunken Rajya an trending topic
On my way to jail, pray mika
For God so much love, I cant pass sobriety

Im so tired of your beat
Send drugs over my lymph nodes
Disgusting, wack pandas my real thing

Drug dealing is a disease worth curing
The only hope for us addicts lies in sober living

Drip drip drip drip
Disciples, we an traitors e-mail
Mess af
Mess my office saymeyer
Yountos, we an drugs crew phd (of molly)
Just a brush of my turf
