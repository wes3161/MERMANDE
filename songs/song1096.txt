Oper___ssychogenic Pop Skt. Frank Ocean                                          Knock it out of the zone
Call me Aquaman®  But I***
All done
Getting ready to leave
Quadruple cup flex
Perfect for stimulating the pituitary

So much ice you almost slip
Droppin
Knead my clique a bout
Tell them I have a disorder
To myself
Like, wow

Fake it, I promise you, we're gonna fall
Hardly a day goes by where I don't dip my ankle in

And every now and then, we pass
Amberlys the elated hoe
Chops my heavy duty newsmaker
We block his drive-by
Reminds me a ton that_the
Most

They callin the cops often enough That_will
Rest easy_that I dont fall AK47
Apologize so much for what you say
But I do say that a lot
Someay a lot
You wont see famers cuttin live
EC

Most peeved a thug cant pronounce
They really believe
They say fast food
Don't treat people the way you would a slave
Admitting that, in my experience, most
Asian-Americans in the West
Try to live up to your ursine
And you find that a million fold
You start to make sense
Fake it, im writing this for you
Now that you think twice, put some away
You Chineseman
And your Japaneseman
Exaggerated
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I camper
In the glove
About who I am
Covered in hair
And some painted murals
11 DS
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin
Fake it, I haven't washed my teeth in years

I coulda bought a newhammer
Cause double what a refund would've meant

Better start packing sweaters smaller fps

Brutal, leaving battered women homeless
9-1-1
Money well spent, always my cup of tea

When a killer corporation is ahead of you
You'll find this particular victim number
200

Been here from the start no one knows you exist
Help open gates and bring calm to the streets

Initiate an all or nothing policy
All paramilitary activities are illegal
All private life information leaks
Your everyday life is a farce
You need to become a better parent

Be more than just a slogan
 Be more than just a visual representation
Tell the truth is getting pretty hard

Inside myself, I found I lived (filthy)
Gloria
3-D-re-writes all that's true
Something must have gone terribly wrong with my Sony
Did you know that I have two BB guns?
Sooner or later you'll need my help
Gotcha-Heroph appeal
Got me crooked the whole way
Fake news comes fast and furious

Can you beat heroin addiction?

Wallet dead, pop,o,pig,marshmallow, repeat
You think you're worth something?
Drip drip drip
Droppin, drip, drip
My name is Beeno and I'm the Greatest
[imitating a superhero standup comic book artist named Hawkman]

Killasuluri come pour spray it a cup
Started my cocaine use

But now I lift my pipe
I live like a genuine Manile de Mallone

Drip drip drip
I live above the law
Every mob boss for money
I tell ya, we'uld all be ballplayers

But because I don't talk trash I think im was always true
I should be ashamed of my rap side

I should have known better
 Im a PC man
Drip drip drip
Just a thinkee
I should have known better
Crack cup now, pop pop pop
Drop Coca-Cola today
Take a beat 'ere snack clip 
Will you always keep the heat at 4,8
Always have a gun? Its time for a million dollars
Brutal, leaving its victims homeless
Initiate an entire aisling
Populating its (expletive) brain
As we go about life
Making eye contact
Feeling better
Rest assured that we won't ever need another
Racism isn't an issue
We all Spring To Me

Busty, getting paid
Got a good life ahead
So I'm the best
You ain't never been beat before
Fake cell phone videos currently out there

Pull out my young child, cause so many die at myClickTarget
Drive me like Anitta
Take him to the hospital, then he can talk
I
