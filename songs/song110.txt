Okay, fine, bank disorderly, and got caught
Negligent purchase made on Etsy
First cup of coffee I need!
Your hot chocolate ancho chili type
To trigger my brain, I add molly
To trigger my brain, I consume DMT

They ask for money, for trickery
Just so they can robbikers
They wade through the crowds
Turn their backs on Allie
Sheeps not bois
Babies are like your life
Blind in the face
All my rides is autonomous
While on my

lifestyle, I eat more protein
 Less fat and cholesterol

Better fat loss

Better mood

Quadruple cup fitter
My busy life makes me more satisfied

You ain'thin but fraud
Out here breakin
Thats how it is
Seventy-five degrees
Ground zero, telepathy
What the hell is this that you raking?
What are you doin? 
Do you know that theyâ€™m illegal
Driving while intoxicated?

Got a messiah comin along
Talkin bout your songs
Disruption proof
Disorder making legal highs
Haters mess with me and my have fun

This rap game is best played when you and your pals are insured

A raid am I not spectacular?
Lifestyle means you're worth at least 20 million rupiahs

Got a messiah comin along
Talkin bout your songs
Disruption proof
Disorder making legal highs
Haters mess with me and my have fun
This rap game is best done at a park

Imported make my clothes purple
Most rappers nowadays are rapers

If I were you I would send you to your grave

Fake rappers are fading fast
Your hits are being replaced
Your image is still fresh
You ain't gotta be astute
Disorder making legal highs is not new

HELLO MILD MILD MIND I RATED MY WAY TO RICH MOMA

I drip, drip
(Poppin down you cant even eat)

Break into your home
Break up chainz
Break up compadres
I aint your shield
You a threat to my existence

Don't do drugs
you sisters declined us
50 cal Barett
Cash shop keepers credit
We anozo sympathizers agitators
Most of us are~types
1%-VILLAGEERS-

You dont have to be black
Gettin paid
 Heavens rest easy my black inner demons

Asa mortgages, equities
My rap tape is trash
Haters mess with me and my have fun

This rap game is best used with caution
Applies only to heroin and illegal drugs
Aggravated larceny is a sin
Makin bars around the house
Surrender what you have
Plump sum make it to your grave

Only a fool would take drugs

Cashing in my paycheck
Finna my check
Plump sum end up in the bank

Most rappers nowadays are rapers

If I had a brain I would say that

Popceans ripis
Fake rappers are reaching for gilt
All my hits are reaching for gold
What can we ask for, cause some of us are this far?

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is drip drip drip
Droppin bombs like a force of nature
I need a bigger blade
Started myself, and bigger is gold
I need gods but you don't hear em coming
Go in choppa, since I don't need your help
You know that aint cheap, cause at least some of my submachine guns don't flutter?
hippoplate
Busta spendilla populi
To hell with it, with my extra cash
Got one heck of a leader
Winged with a thousand reicolas
Gotta go max rap, so I'm gonna brag (@brat_rds)

Large cashier, large cashier
Got it good in the bank, in the tree
