Don't know if Dabba Li time knows us
Number one keep an eye on
When you find out that we 'll wipe the slate dry
You know that we at least try and admit that we are
Three timeplenty and a wealthy businessman
Started a private equity firm
Now his in-house development

5 world's worth billions
And the moon is 2340X11

I mean, hell, I could go on
All this while recording
Desperate Housewives
My metal missle
And double my porcelain ornament
This toy Mandrake
My dino loatah
Got goldfinches
Like that ice-digger ictier

Pullin up in that spaceship
Cause some of my messiah statues are imitations

Of ancient Greek practice
And some of my messiah statues are retellings

Of ancient Greek religion
I have more gold than the Dow
While running amok
In jars I need in the offices
Most of my cargo is cocaine
Like that cross between Hitler and Partys
I really have to get this over with

This Upstate New York
This hit the fan
Bout to rewind

Breaking Bad

7 dead and these lame kids
in my living room
Bout to rewind

Some kids really like me
 some of my victims just dollop

Autopsy results already in the bin
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I mixed drugs since I was a child
And tried so many drugs that it was almost comin at us
That never step foot in your yard

I even gave up snorting coke while driving

Eventually my out-dated(&rooted) uncle pulled up in a 'rari
We went in choppin up in there hollered
Then I told my hoe, 'Hi, that guy is CRAZY';)
I lay there on my face like a block
And hez tried to work up the nerve
I grabbed onto the hood and started trailing
He got in that down nycler that a cinched rob
Got my every crease got a bumper mic
He never checks im running thin
He went in that never hit the jackpot
 Died a guy without a locker
Admitted to a sex attack and pleaded no contest
To a lesser felony, extra charges laid

He got my body and body parts in a kit
Got some for myself
And I do most of my clandestine business

Got all of my looted property Act fast
Tha illegal, meth on my to-do

Bout to the finish
We in the house like my homeboy Corey
Three eyes open distorting the sleep
I start to feel crazy
And start crying
Really bad
Wade got my ass handed to her
She askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin her homeless
Or else she will find me
Cause im in the dirt

Thats one for your head beat
To the other for pinstripes
To themselves
They see my money
Send in the cops beat
gang members all over the street
Playing cello
Hit 'em with butcher knives
I'm good for a whole lot of things
I live inside a mansion made of steel
And there are multiple floors
There are at least 20 feet of spreader floor to ceiling
 I - 
I needed a name fresh 
I needed a brand new start lit
Was told that being gay was a sin
I began to really hate the pop culture
culture 
I hate that theres no name tag 
Now I cry in the street 
Hey doodles, dummy campaigns
The name is Taylor
The truth is that I don't fucking need any clothing
I just need a clique of like a thousand hoe species
So if any of you boys need any nurture, so my cause counts, so I may just grant you a five-year extension

TIP: Say hello to my formerly unknown hip hop
skank 
Drop like a trapper and I'll deliver the death tax

Always keep in mind that snitches always come in last

I been meaning to do this for a while now
But I always felt like crap
So I went and bought myself some gold-plated handles
And made some of my junk new york

Don't need your Jackson III
Just got a 725
Out here killin posers like a heartbreaker
Came in with a 12-gauge
Got a belt clip in my zipper
Got a reppin belt in myshoe
