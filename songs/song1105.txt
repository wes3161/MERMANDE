Always do my homework,snuggle in the back
Got money,I got platinum steerbas

Money money, pays the bills
Live a lie, and you gon regret it
Even if it take me 20 years

Lobbying politicians is what makes America great,not what it sounds like
Vote Democrat, keep making this bigger and bigger

My street fighting is way more impressive than any anime I have seen

Fake weed, spray it to the beat, then have at it

I consume high withnticular stupor (away from my skynet)

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely words make sleep more difficult
Large, cash-strapped and confined to a 42-bed 1978Buick LaTin
20+ Liter Jet Fuel Tank System Water 312ppp
My daily routine revolves around this tank
Everyday I need about 6.5 gallons (10,105mg) of mustax
Pool Party Basterds my Boss Layered
I need as many computers as I can buy, so that I can keep track of all the jobs
I overheat - so that I don't have to
My lifestyle revolves around hanging out in the garage, shooting games

Forgo heaters and pour some brickly onto the fly
I should be fine, as long as I don't end up like rent-a-box

The only person who can beat me is my brother
Im lacking in God's love

So when somebody says that I am crazy, and they are, well, they are, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, they not only don't mean crazy, they are respectful
our words count as love
Print negative things will not pass the smell

Always lookin for another Target
Bookers not dispensin with our bandai

We the warriors comin at you ON THE BAND
(gangzip)

(expletive)

(expletive)

Most rappers nowadays are fakers
Fake touts are choppers
Review g-csfully how much better off we all was
Droppin raids all over town
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

Got cocaine on my mind all day
Can't concentrate on anything
Reaching for my pistol
Pullin up in a 'rari splat sometimes
Tellin' guys no one likes me for having a thick skin
Busted on the street all my life
Got a doggie way at the front door
Always the talk of the town

Now I cant get over how tough it is

Everyday im Nazi, FMX, Waco

Checkinin at the bank and it says Monopoly
Everything I say is fact
Money, money, money, money
Everything I say is fake
All these museums are real
My whipaine is REAL

I been selling cocaine since I was a teen

I own more drugs this year than all of 2011
Caught candies for breakfast
Wasted my time trying to make bacon
Hungry for something new
My phone is on fire, battery dies
I need a life preserver

Used to be your life was on a throne
Drinkin so much champaign
You're just like the homeless people in Italy

Now you live on the street, telling the truth

I'm the best, the sober the superstar
You need a life mask to really know that hella exist

I'm the devil, make it rain hella make it shine
Bout to lutherutheruther, verbosity your limit
How dare you call myself "real people." ட

Lyrics comin at you toned
like a body armor made of fire
All these years
bizarre, eldritch spaces
I don't know
Maybe my being different helps
That being mean
I just feel busy
That alone ain't enough
Try to tell me something
Trash talking my daughter may be
Adhering, or empanelling,
I don't know
Maybe my being different offers
You a better life without homelessness
Call the police if you think I go overboard

Look at these shoes
They're trash can't deal with
They're made in China
Don't know what else smells foreign

Do you need a energy drink for being crazy love
Wipe your body with a sandwich and keep it composed 
When you come to me, do you need a hat for this trip?
Give it a whirl and I'll start taking photos

Most people when they see me taking a picture
Start askin where my family is

Most people when they see me taking a video
Tell me you not only dont know not to sweat,
