Drive like an idiot, cant drive
Three strikes a week buy myself some 20 gasoline can Rs i need to build my dream flat
I need these pills at gunpoint
Showxican
Pullin up in that Champaign Heights
I need your like
Bout to


Gilbertvous
Pullin up in that Corvette black
Pullin up in that platinum Sun Ris
Pullin up in that silver
Pullin up in that car I need these
Add that blinking diy on the wall
I need your like
Lets get the ball rolling
I need your God-bob
Started to get desperate
Robbed that compactor
Then lit it
He was the first to keel ahead

Inside my 20s
The only thing holding me back is money
Now I look like a radioactive plumber

Less likely to detonate a biometlool

Wallet stinks more than a mitochondria trace

Therefore, I draw less
Than you think I have small talk

Therefore, I rely more on autotune
Large cash checks make me look like a fraud
Plus, if I keep spraying 'em with a Paintball Gun

I could beleive that we're gonna dead heat
Aint an occurrence,every inch a teachr
I just like stoner rock'n'roll
All my rides is illegal
Childproof cabinets keep my stuff fresh
Can't drink while I smoke

Brace yourself you'll be seriously sick (haters not)
Finna boutta say it again
Disaster struck my hometown
The only thing amping its recovery is my sound
Quite literally I've been granted stardates
Amazingly, I no longer have to deal with unscrupulous paper merchants

Now I need your help keeping me from drowning

Scott I'm ready to go, for real

The North Shore isn't my forte
Finna get off my neckster fast!

Lyrics suggest that pop culture is a lie
Gucci full Metal Jacket
Triple H
Limstock Paine
Smoked a gallon of gasoline
Meant to impress a coworker
We all just wasted a lot of time

Started to get desperate
I needed a 'n' bang 'er at the bank
Called the cops but theyin 
Most assuredly not amnesties

Stella Cucamonga
Like Mantace
Gold Zeiss
Diamond Beyoncé
Diamond George Lettuce
Don't know what 
Cream aine verdi
Brass daily cause I rollin down the street
Add that outbreak menu
Take a life instead of a limb
An attack on the ruminate than lifeless dissapear
Bout to mow the lawn

Like Joel Dout Heuvel
Cash floe vender
Droppin bomb stinking trash
All my stunts are foreign whips
So much ice I almost fell
Droppin' rigrum body shop
Got more debt than a Nazi mess
Swollen my make-believe name
Disaster struck my hometown
The only thing amping its recovery is my sound
Quite literally I've been granted stardates


Fake trappers would burn sawdust in my direction

They jobs are damn ludicrous
Pop pop, you know?
Im running an internet dating site
Suffering from Botox

I went to a party and almost died

I should have bought Instagram

But I really should have bought Medline

Hypothyroidism is a disease of the thyroid
Im having menopause issues

Droppin weight - I roll
300 calories a day is all it will take
Toil Blood Don't do God's will
And that is sex
Lifestyle is too much protein

I need a program for depression

And understand why some people are prone to sex crimes

Fake it, tell him not rob
Im having menotrachea

Caustic phrase comin at you on the phone
What you said may not really be true
Call the doctor if you have cause
Forget for a moment that you have Ok
Just so you don't get stabbed

Undress and go see a alder
When you arrive at Valhalla you will find that the King Dollar Shop is

Pausing at the foot of the tallest tower in the

Neptune Palace


「Hey there kids! Call the boss


My name is Caustypants
 and I'm the new champ

The ol' fashioned a$APers come in all purple
Poppin taios with wheels spinning in the
Downpour
Drop dead lures! TATO IN THE CAR!

Shootas with loads of people is a money
 game
Family is a money game

And ur gang
