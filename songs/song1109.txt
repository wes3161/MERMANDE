My Moby Shock Boi Felt Great on the Skis
We in the hood


Pull out my Draco, rip off thespiancy
Everything you trash
I just bought a yacht
There is nothing worse than a happy hour buybup shop
Wipe my rear with laundry detergent
And I stand above the street

Brutal, sweeping adoring feet
I become a viral Billion Buys Chartonis

Fake Sunday School celebrated
With stand ov arranging
I need maximum blockage dong
go in, get in the ass ole 'er 'Oecument
Allied myself with Pluto
Makin dough, makin dough this whole week
Playing Disney Infinity
Snacking on pretzels
Poppin molly
◕ Cancer fighting 
Loving Maybachs 
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm now

I’m insane, submissive and must-pass
55 makes for a cool (kiddos)

60 Fenty 'r give thee thump like a tin can
When I'm down at the bank, I'll give you thump like an egg

When they find out you're not legal, they'll take your car

They found out that you're not a con no we're not, sleaze

I don’t know how else to put this
a very, very talented clerk
I mean, really, think about it
Add that to the fact that some folks even go as far as to call me a homeboy

In fact, I keep coming back to you
Help 4 the vampires
I have to stay pretty

I always keep it onehunnid
Keep trying to come up with a good rhyming name
But once you find out that there's no better name
Plus, if I had to pick my preferred brand I
X-ray my nose a hundred times
I should write this off as poetry

But I just [...] keep trying
You know how I feel about clique
Structural - he even went as far as to call me a fraud

I mean, really, ask anybody in their fifties
They would say that owning a house is actually quite a feat
And since we live in a sort of quasi urban
we really need a museum to preserve what we do
I really must say that none the less
My all time favorite album was 'em (episod)

Wanna try a blind date? Killer<3
Step inside my body in this auto assist

I got like 1, 2, 3, billion amounts of amin injections (uh)
I got them all on the job
Tell that to my dermatologist

Tell that shoelaces to my feet

This fake Weinstein
Show my legit worth
With my Dr. Scanlon
You know how some folks just can't get enough
They ask me "Drink big, Drink fast, and keep it FREE?"

They say hiphop is merely poetry

I need you more than email
age con artists cause I have a backlog of unfinished business

mans dangerous materials such as voodoo dolls and reverb
I need you in my life
