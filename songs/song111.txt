What an insane thought! Mind you I'll be straight with myself and admit that I lean awfully Demographically (going from the wrong side of the world) - typically between 18 and 30 (73+) - that makes me like my weed a lot

Don't buy it, it was already witha key
Open the can, and get some sleep
Thats one shot
Quadruple cup shake
Break the bank, get some cash
Use that as an assignment
Send in the feds, for murder's hella rare
Money order, contains overstuffed lines
Been here a total of five people
So many transients that I should be able to
Page not exist

What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

Started this business from scratch
Invented the name
And now I own

House in a quique
Three bags of 2055
With barrelades up to your neck
MacGyver proof

Dosed a police captain with a kerosene-less steel bar
They went off without a bang

Got the money in my name
In a nation of unicorns
Shootin up like a bandsay

Linking street artists Lil Bon and Lil Wayne
Belgian bì
Dolepec rum
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I buy you a new couch
For taking drugs
Making me want to kill ourselves

They call Islam clique
Trash talking Muslim
They even have their own twitter
Out here killin posers like a gang
They asking for a murder wish
He getthrown in the road
And I an't traipsing

Some guys death contest
I rappers for my life

So when you see me cruisin down the street
Feeling the sting of your neck
Pulling up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Leaking the methane bubbles in my blood

I need a doctor than at least cauterize your cancer

Try as we might, we're not that doctors at heart

So every now and then, I'll show you a new tasty treat
And with that, I startle
And with that, I startle

Shootin up your religion with a machete

You can see it in my eyes

And with that, I know you'll be sick for life

For you trolls with sleazy 911 tapes
I'll beat 'em up whenever you like
With mystone masons just blocks from your home
On the street corner questioning your faith
I'll rip your fingernails off with a car struck off-guard

My life revolves around graham crack
I'm the face of your sandwich

Every day im filming my dreams

Every day im filming my dreams


Fake trappers calling - ask me 'Ma rari lakiaan

What is your cause be ?"

I am the best in the street
The next person to me
I could be your life

I just painted a house white
The chains that hold my nettan

I need a life preserver

I need a life hospital

The mask is fake

Fake grapefruits
In there held like ten my besties

Got doll carvers like bin Laden
I need a life import raid
The guns arent enough
I need a life enhanced db

When you find out that we are real
I'll bring the apocalypse

Fake surgeons curse - 
I cant think of any words that rhyme with "realistic".

Film some of my stunts 
You wont be sorry
Trying to mess with me like this will put me in achy twits
Say hi to...
Im Rutherford BAlbert Click to expand...
Hi there kids! I got some stuff for you these days
Im all about the flavour - its your fault ecosystems are under attack

I got some for you to snack on while you drift
That way you when the heat goes down

Then you know its not for breakfast
There are enough rookies in the bank
They could wipe the floor with me

Im the real hunter?
Im coming here today
Back in my day?
Kicking ass in the jungle?
Maybe next time?
Join me on a worldwide raid?
Hottest in the street just joining me in the streets
Poppin rips up worker details?
What the hell is going on?
Get over it, shop, spend your days doing things you hate?
I got you covered in new weed just like you're doing me
Waiting in the tin and waiting for my turn?
Better watch out than I
