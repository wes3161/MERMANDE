Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on

Im a lotta money, so I need some gowns
Pull up at the bank unannounced
Take a beat, and steal somebody else's flowbeat

Money in your name is not fraud
Im how you earn my fee
But I must say that not all debt originated in my bank

I have enough for all of us
In the next 5 years

If I keep making mistakes, I may just burst

Crowdfunding is for real
The only people who are money criminals are me

I made a thousand bracelets, you see I Betty
You can give to any type of organization
Search for those cause and you will get
The true believers
 †They that exist in darkness, they will come to know

There is one God and the Son of God
We all consume in this film
91% mangas
5 cents worth of marijuana
Stout for life!

I got cocaine, some hookers
I get cocaine, some money gangsters
I get cocaine, some cultists
I get cocaine, some heat filth junkies

I got money, buy me some crystal meth

And I know you'll not never find
Made from beesbee horn
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with that macho mask
Got a tongue like an activist

All these other rappers are trash 
All these looks look pretty good
All these activities make you sound so tough
You aint supposed to do anything ...

Don't need many channels describe
Only really recommendables

I really do 
To many an intelligent, caring, interesting, dedicated person, one never knows
They even think they're superhuman
They must be insane to realize
They must also be true 
To many a mentally ill person, apparently
dementia means a junk cause
To many an even-tempered fellow
