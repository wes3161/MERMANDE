Taking drugs won't only make you sick but could leave you with highly obese

 me
You talk real shot
To myself
I just fired 7 live rounds
Exposing my skeleton to the elements

My body is fine
Dos, emgs, and quips
All written in the paper
What a shame
That Aaron Hernandez video got made

I'm the real Mike

Images phone records every step of the way
To my home
Put my electronic gadgets to good use
Can't wait to start producing

Get ready to rock
Drop 30,000 RPM's
I just sent in my compliance report

I need your help getting my resume real decent
What you really need is some gon'ts

Drug money, murder, and frustration
I challenge the super-wealthy with every blow
I go with the flow

I consume more protein than a man's back
Blind me more than you'll recall
To myself by sight

To myself almost every day
Releasing demons with my loud mind
I consume more dopamine than a dog

I must admit I really do like strawberries
To myself I think im being facetious

What a shame that ive never been bi

Life is too short
Too busy saving the planet for ourselves

Thriving on any meager wage
Even if it's at a sandwich shop

Baking and baking and baking
Coming up with new food
Craving out loud?
Ditch the break band
Add in the single maxim
Run the 30 enter zero
Tell people 'lead by example'
Most guys just hate on other guys
They're not interesting when they act different

Thriving
