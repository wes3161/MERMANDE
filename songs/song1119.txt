Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu On "Hot 97"
Wake up, lotta money
Makin molly
Backing it up, stacking it
Inside this van, it aint passive
So much water, in my system
So much ice that it flaces
Pull up in that Lamborghini
Pull up in that Lambo
Pull up in that black Benz
Pull up in in that black
Zapping you with Tesla
40 carat gold wheels
I need your body shop
In the garage
Pull up in that spaceship
You know they aint cheap
Im always super clean
You better barricade the car

And when I pull up outside
They gonna take my pants
They better show
Whos WWE

We at least get acknowledged
On the broadcast
The loan shark is a must
All these different loans
Help me out in the yard
Rest in Lil Peep

Money lass
help me out by the bag
Bust 'em up
END BIG BUSINESS
The lefty think im amped
They will beat us in the house
