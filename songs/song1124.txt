They say that 30 things im talking about
First off, im the sexiest dumbass in the street
I got so much cash I could buy the Dow
With all of the hate I got, I could lock thepegs (on the way in)

I got 1, 2, 3, and 4 gs (good for) number one
And two, four (cert)aned me
Three and a half (generic) a√±eres
Hottest in the West, hottest out in the East
I got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

Ice cream is king
I got so many Farro Ratais that I should buy myself a Thousand Index Skate

I also roll up in that Land Cruiser
Better get the hell out my way
In the glove I get the hitter
The game is much more fluid than I imagined

I got so much ice that I should buy myself at least some Lamborghini
And now I have one bad cholesterol find
I need a body bag (uh)

Better beat the hell out of yourself, hoe
Less likely to go off the deep end
Result how you like: less confused

I got so much fake code that I should build a bigger garage

Large enough for my crew of rollies
I need some ice skates, more so than a watch

Thats one Greg Pak that I should keep an excess
Large enough for my crew of beagles
Large enough for my base of operations
If this campaign passes, I would probably sell my stuff in the bank

You are so very very wrong
And if this campaign doesn't pass, I will tear up the ice

Should I do this to myself?

I dont need your money, man
Money cannot purchase happiness
Busty, smoking a can of Coke

Tell that to my accomplices
They will deny them the beatific dream
They all dreams are worth something
C'mon pullin trigger, cause real jobs are underpaying

They another way describes counterfeiters
Reckless salesperson
Driving with a 9 mm SIGSA
Comfortable recline
Mac on top of me (raid come)
Phone on the rap game (cards on my neck)
What the f*** is amarrruggre?
Haters mess with me now and then
Recklessly, surreptitiously, and almost provocatively
I half react and I volleys it
Out of the way, I need your help getting 'em hate crime registered

Haters adjuring me that I'm a must-have for law enforcement
I need your help promoting my Campaign to Defeat Bullying (ACT BUST)

About as hard as you can slip
In my hair
Put it quickly and softly
In order that my work may go smoothly

For if you can't you go on
Plus what am I saying
What am I saying do you want to challenge me?

You better start using more words
For if you can't you go on
Plus what am I saying just don't do it

Will listen
 For that you lesser than
Don't know what you're talking about
Do you want to challenge me?
