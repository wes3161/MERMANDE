My every step is greater than an entire tyrannical regime

I consume far more gold bars than platinum bands
Than the U.S. Dollar is the gold standard
I consume more gold like a runic document than a true god
I examine more than 100,000 DVDs a day
I have the audacity to call myself the next Dr. Seus

I consume more gold like goldbugs than diamonds

I consume more gold like golddeeds than porridge
I consume more gold like golddeeds than goldbugs
I consume more gold like golddeeds than golddeeds
