Love this shirt
Pull out my whip boy
Keep honkin pop cuz im on top of you
Always keep in mind that some folks be hard
All these rims im dragging though my leg
Pull down at the front door
Talkin bout your stealin cell phone
I can tell you a lot advices haters
It been a while since I told you

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and french yeast (yuh)
Xanax and halogenated glycogen (skkrt)
Xanax and l-theanine (ooh)
Hottest name in the street
Plump, lean, and with pair well trained
My tools aint passive
So when you find me lacking go trip-trip

That should do it.

Now why are yuh bars so heavy?
They pull the trigger pretty easily
Like a five-shot max
Pullin up at you like a dangerous zone

While I type that woah contains the reverb
What would you do if you had to read my script?
I went to prison for having a threesome
Sentenced to death for having a threesome

When I was like 12 years old, my stepmom always congratulated me on what I was even built for
With her name on the barrel of every Miller
My personal best is at(?) you
That tattoo on my arm
The fact that you serious think I kill myself every day

It makes me sick to my stomach

As much weight as a C9

Therefore, I consume more protein than almost any other meal I've ever been on

I consume so much fat that I feel like I're bursting out of a beat
I consume so much junk food that I may as well quit

As much cheese as I can get it right
And honestly, it really hurts that much

Don't know what else is coming next

Even more juice, sweeter, stella
Your sobriety is at an all-time high

I Know How You Make It Rain Every Day (/TYF)

Now that my ice-breaker (aka pineapple) hat is like an inch inside my ears
I'm really crankin up your confidence
You don't do a beat if I stop you in your tracks
You even act like you're a dissident
So much money's in your head that you could sell a home
Throw it back at you with a resounding 'n' roll
'Til I get it all,'' rippin at you with its stunning black (?) surface
You no longer have to think twice about making a splash
Try your best, and maybe some of that water you just dumped () will pique your interest
