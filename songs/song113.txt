Three Roxas paid for, ready to flash

Large money bechashes loaded with 38 aounce rounds
Drug dealers, pizza fight DJs

Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

I should put a 45 between your eyes
Finna boutta gonna have a drive-by
Tap the trigger twice and you die BANG

All these other rappers just copies of me
Run the game got the lock and the key
What you fakers need is a lobotomy

Everything iced got a toilet made of gold
Look at all these platinum plaques I just sold (uh)

Three eyes open so you clowns can’t roll me
Got a draco cause I never call the po-lice
