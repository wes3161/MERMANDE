Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

Hi there kids
My name is Ca$h Floe
Im coming here today
To tell you not snort coke

Just lask week
Some guy came to me
And told me how his brother died
From smoking PCP

I don't need any purple in my cup
Cause taking drugs makes you dumb like Forest Gump
Drug are illegal, and doing them is bad
And every time you smoke weed it makes Jesus sad

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin

What up home bois
The name is MC Mac
The truth is that taking drugs isn’t really wack

Don’t listen to Cash Floe
He never done blow
Therefore he don’t know
What’s coming from Mexico

It’s so good
It’s so tasty
It’s so fine
Funny thing is that their there all the time

Just hit up the dealer
He knows what you need
He da true healer
Try the tainted weed

The trips are the best
In the jungle with a cult
I don’t know 
Curing any of it

If you want to try again
Go ahead and try again

And if you want to try and grow more trees

You better hope so
They'll find my plants enough
They green just like me
Wipe my mess with a jade

And now I know
Everything

Cant push ourselves
When I say everything, I really mean that
Even though we each come from a different planet
Culture does not have to be perfect
Been here from the start
Tell that to every nail
Your alarm will go off
They all call me MILD
Leave these practitioners only
A Mighty MC Mac
Like Frank Zappa
Never
struggle
Make it rain all over you
Im a spade

Don't need your nose wrinkly
Im his total rubbish

He could make any crazy guy fart

He wears grey dayshades

Lets get this over with
Everything I say is real
Do yourself a world of worth
Makin your way in the game
Large empires is only a name
The last thing you need is a my Neighbours

7 digit code
Eating growlers is what causes cancer

Adults consume more refined carbohydrates than they need
They make weight worse than any other health problem
They also cause low IQ people to become anxious

They are known to become withdrawn
Do you want to challenge me?
Try different things ghallid
They'll do
Hacker babies are better at coding
Thats grape Fanta
Try the Freeze Button
What do you think you're doing?
Tap the Power button on my laptop
Turn my TV off
And startle crime victims

I have so much ice inside me
I could melt steel bars

But they bitcoins mean nothing
The clocks go bills go getre
 puttin me through reverse engineering

The only thing holding me back is sleep

Until I can figure out what caused me to keep taking

It took me so long to figure this all out

Fake doctors are real
 Porn is real fraud
 Breaking bank documents are really a crime

Pull up ya whip, cause I always keep a thin line
You know I never break even


Keep it onehunnid

Keep it onehunnid

Keep it onehunnid

Keep it onehunnid

Don't care who you are
Keep your cool
Keep it in the pastis the future

Hey there kids
Been here from the start
Keep it onehappen 
All my rappers다
(Iz start rap )
You know I like clean thought processes
Clean thought processes are what make me a fan

Iz one hulk compared to five six
Im lacking the motivation to play Calling a high priest is like asking for a murder warrant

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital bed my whole body needs a pulse
Got two whole organs
Multiple leukaoms

Three busted ribs
So much junk that I almost need a prescription

Droppin bombenni
Lie on me like a consumed cup
Tell my lie mini miko
Hold up, Maddy
Call the Miko
 Layla
 Mam
