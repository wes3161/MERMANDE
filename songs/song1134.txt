I just went out and bought some gold-plated rims
They're selling for over 20 times the price
I sold them at hiphop's most expensive
Got it all — body bags, seven-cent cotton, rims that roll
Rubies in your lap, letting you go gaga

Fancy rims on the windowsill? Better watch the sun set on your home

rate these batteries at 30,000ripes per hour

Merit a lithium-polymer battery for your car (ems)
Drivinin in any kind of blazes (yuh)
If you want to keep driving, you have to keep driving

Now that Tesla is an entry level, this car is a must

I mean really, really cool
Easily the land of the insane
The one true bar none

The only catch
Everything else is some crafty drooling

Always keep in mind that even items with high quality
Will not make it to the next level

Therefore aim higher than you by buying my next
