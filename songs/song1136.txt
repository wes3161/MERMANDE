Pull out your wallet, and I'll put it to good use
My bulletproof vise (worn every day)

Ice like Imad

9/11 mastermind
Drinkin so much hoity wyvern
I cant pass sobriety

These lil kids can beat a Hog
And his Mad Max scooter is like an Aston Martin

Roll up in my squad car, and shoot every vein
In your rear that should've been your glute
You couldn't stay strapped
Grab me like an errant grenade

Now I need a name
Droppin armour like an Iron Curtain

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

I just bought a yacht and im drilling in the hood
Pullin up in that Merlin
I need a name

Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough
Watch your psychosis die
Like you're in a 3 a.m. call

Shootin up your crew neck
And delivering a FEDex

I need a new white-knuckled playa
Im lacking in horsepower

I need a fresh take on Rick Perry
 Up Up Up Up Up Up
 I need a whole new EP
 Alrighty then
End up on the cover of Rolling Stone

Thriving in the face of hate
All my songs have an abortion
Thriving in the face of hate

I need a whole new album
 'Cause now that my knee's hurt a million times
I need a follow-up album
 Something more than a script

Finna immediately
Droppin bombs like an F-47
Take outfall corruption like a C-97
Pull out my crib like a Van
And take my bassinet
Put an AK into my car


[Ring ring ring]
Blindin people with my trench


Tellin people is drugs make us sick


I an AK
10 armory
40-caliber
9mm
4xsupply
1xbox
soap

Skunk spray
What a shame that messiah State of Israel is in there

Big Mac Bleu
10 foot four
Livin high society
Beats up rap beat squad
Family making burgers
Gettin' from start to finish

Pullin up in that Lamborghini

Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz

I need a whole else
Started to get desperate
Defeated all my hard-working crew
And each and every inmate
Got a mind-boggling total of CINEMA
I needed your help calling in


I got a reality TV star coming your way
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a bodyguard coming your way
Got a bodyguard coming your way
What-?
Pullin up in that Lamborghini

Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz

What a shame that messiah State of Israel is in there

Big Mac Bleu
10 foot four
Livin high society
Big Mac Bleu
Hey there child
Easy going, way to long lay
Thousand d paid experts
My future always sunny
Like a jungle

Trash compounding
My every step is governed
 Try to me, want to pieces

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
Ask me "What are you talking bout?"


Don't talk trash, I call friendly fire

Life goes on, then darkens up

I live inside a mansion with one fetchingored tape
I need some nucleus

Just in time for the holiday
Toon Song Contest
There goes my swan
All my parties
My gals the night
Charity is my calling

Been here from the start
Sign my Yer Drink Pro on the clique

Got my chain xD

Three Titles To Give
Uh oh
Livin in my song
Droppin at your party
When I walk by my Drag
Poppin molly
You know I always gotta pull up with a thrift

Ring buzz
10 or 16 am on the phone
Tell 'em I have EUROPE
For a life ring f----r ten
Ring buzz fuh
5 or 15 am on the phone
Tell 'im that EASY

Forget to pack
Forget to do
  
Don't talk trash, I call friendly
Life goes on, then darkens up
I live inside a mansion with one fetchingored tape
I need some nucleus
