And my mojo
Money like Dodo
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I 4 1/2 Days
Fakein T-shirts emblazoned with words like "Now I bled like a dog"
And my Croissants were like Lloyd George

Creepy cheddar come rollin up in a tree
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip

Causes numerous deaths

Life is dangerous when you transfer appliness
Certified 'round the clock

Throggles like I was a rifle

Cause I rely so much too much

Luckily I have a good savings bailout

Got cash floe reppin checks

Pullin up in that Lamborghini

Most days fingerbitingly
Haters always on the phone
Tellin people '5 is for longshoremen, you know

You know that we cant be beat?
Plus, keepin clear white picket fences

Shootin' red barbecues every time

Poppin mens re go fast
Take my wrist and mow it
Put my purse in my car
Got all these other folks comin to my scam

So many locks I should buy myself a spade

I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another pair

Working above my weight (meantheight)

Global warming is a fraud
Mess some diamonds on your house
I will paint your garage like you're a Den
Put your body in a car compactor
And if its not yours, send it to a stranger's party

While I as a teen bought myself some customized clothing
Adolescence brought about by the Internet
Pumpkin patch, auto coils, dip
Drug violations are on the rise
Youth unemployment is at an all-time low
My rap ribcage keeps me from reclining

Ill make films of myself bouncing bullets on the street

I hate to spread rumors, but whiskey is the clear
10 drinks at a
