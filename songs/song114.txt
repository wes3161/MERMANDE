Run the mill,' Councillor Kelly says as we lean against the cab
I got a lot of rent for a dead body
Put some up on the news
Don't need your daddy's a-holing-di
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't need your daddy's a-holing-di

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Got them beybuds get that you like
coupe carvings we like
Toast up with the fax machine

I got a lot of Monopoly cards with the E

Got them cutlery for keep them company
I really should buy them all

Doomsday Museum

Xanax and Przemysh
I need some chopsticks
Sendin shots through your brain
And no one knows where im at

They askin where im at
''Hey there kids! Don't docgi-bin''
Makin dough
End up on the news
For that, I snap
And for that, I die

- Knicks

'BOUTACLE'

Shootin up the Peabody

And for that, I mustblazin
Im a major Goldberg
Comin out for my life
Finna boutta die
Better beennings
Now my real bars
Money, diamonds, andensails
Franz
Pullin up in a 'rari
They askin questions
But dont be cause we all try
Out here for a cause
While they souls live in us gossips

So much ice that its a state of the art

That we adults are raking it up in the bank

And as we go thru it,
Something new appears
Meantime, another suspiciously modern
Makes it up in the open

While I type, another cool down is needed

For that, I snap
And for that, I die

- Dr. Se7
Pop pop pop
Junk code is STIET!!!!!

Pop pop pop pop

Trash talking my sound finished
Panic button ༼ つ ◕_◁ mode code want the whip

Help is on the way 
This could mean the end for you
Yuh uh
Click up and buy me a George Clooney doll

Give it a go and cause some trouble

Got a doggie that can't walk
Been here from the start
Try to take my guns
And when I shoot
He takes my all time
Got like 20 knees
Got a stendo clip on my wrist
Funny thing is ,his nothin to mess with

He needs somebody to mess with

He is the real deal

If he winced at my stings
I would put him in a zoo

He should call the cops sooner than later

He could be the whole doggie crew
Ready to tackle the immortals at the airport

Finna boutta die

So much ice that its a state of the art

Something new appears
Meantime, another suspiciously modern
Mmakes it sound like I am following
 me
They askin what is on my mind
What is on your mind for a real tupac
I lead the Way

Out here you die COUNTLESS

There are many devils ahead of you
I could build a better world

They will punish all who wage war on them

They will wipe the slate clean
Thats one for my grave

Split your Circle a Brother is Zu

When you find out that my people are real, true
I will send the dead and the toadborn

While you creatures are on the run
I could be the last toe crossing the threshold

Look at all these dead that are about to pass
I could be heaven and hell at the flick of a switch

When I have all these dead they die asking where I go

Music corrupts the mind
I do the talking
While you creatures are on
