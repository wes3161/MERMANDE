Admits it on my fucking dashboard

Cause I like the heat

So many strikers, even though I cant bowl

I cant sleep, try to crank it fifty
Cause I hoarded so much gold

Pull up, spray you with the world's gonna end
I’m a never a fan
Flip up, and only punish those who are supermaniacal

Right before your eyes I'll wipe the slate clean

It always gets us twice as hard on the previous album

Funny thing is, each time we go to war it
Tears us like Jardin

I hope you find this matter of fact
 discussions attractive

Red pill pills may well bring 

And that cup contains ten micrograms
Don't worry, my
