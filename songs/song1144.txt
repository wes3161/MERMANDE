My amp pulls you towards infinity of sound
Discharge at your crib clip
Pull up in a skiff and you cant get where you are flat
Pull up in a truck like the snare rhymes with SPEED

I should be able to start praying
Three strokes without speaking
Running from cops, guitarists, and making billion-dollar movies
I don't need any miracles anymore
