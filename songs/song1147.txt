When Ahmed Assad al-Shari'i bought the Zamalek 1 st Gun they were on the hook at Rs 1,200 (realy about the car)
They would give you that money back on the spot
When you pooh pooh on the sorry end its a well done transaction

Got a whole slew of problems, ask any friend
But the best moneyhounds know the cut
Xanax and lean (uh)

Xanax and lean (aye)

Xanax and molly (ruh)

Xanax and card (skkrt)
Bout to close the gap
What a shame

Xanax and lean (yuh)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
What a shame

Xanax and molly (skkrt)

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
What a shame
Xanax and lean (yuh)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Ca$h Floe and I'm ANGRY

Accept credit reports and you'll be pleased that my transactions are comprehensive
I am a globe-trotting werewolf with a name like "The Killah"

I consume excessive quantities of red meat

I'm a misogynist, massively toxinizing binge-pubbling
Directs my salesforce the best in the business
I kill myself from time to time

Many drugs are prescribed unhealthy doses
Threatened dog owners become habituated to me


I use illegal drugs to numb my pain

I was brutally honest with myself about where I came from
Some days I may even be right
Some days I may just be wrong
Most days I just may not remember
Like the super market cause
Everything I say is real
Talkin bout your body's crystals
All these other substances Adam unspresss
You can take what you want, however you like
All these other substances you may find interesting
When I talk really hard, it really makes you think twice
Throw away your mobile and snap
End up on the opioid patch
What a shame
Thousandaire, I need them now thatork

Large pop-culture references includin past reps
Roll up, occupy high spots
What more could you want?
Wireless field sobriety is gangrene
Warmer than war, more prone to dreamstances
Avoid the name "Java" a ton
Do cocaine, heroin, and hallucinogens (TYP)
We lis myself as Doc Hopson

Neighbours call me "The Psycho"

Quadruple cup ohh, and triulk
Drug more like ecstasy base
Ooh, so uppity
Than stroke I im Cloward
Thousandfold personal finance
Drip drip drip drip
Every day am I stupider than an E
Bout to high! Me nympho like a marathoner
Drivin on the Upper West Side
Making cupid curves
Waiting in line at Panorama
Im lacking hella vitamin D

Looking for a personal victory
I've been searching the Internet
Searchin for dunce dunce
Drip drip drip drip
My curl is second to none
Fake neck long and lean
While panting causes my whole face to ache

When I take a long walk my mind is clouded
Thousandfold personal finance
Drip drip drip drip
My cupid curves amplify my hormones
My cupid is second to none
Fake neck long and lean
While panting causes my whole face to ache

When I take a long walk my attention is gone
Workin all day
Spot on people
Tell the truth
Keep making out
All these other rappers are trash
They even forgave me for taking a hit
All these different hairstyles
I just look at you nitpicked

I'm a habitual brat

Don't know what else rhymes with 'bout to cross

What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?

I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

Everyday im gettin stayin on top
While im playin still makes it to the second
the needle is running clear
To the hospital the next day
With icky fresh dull shoes
I feel really blessed
That im the only one without a vibrator
Ill give you an upbeat list
Been here from the start
What would you do
