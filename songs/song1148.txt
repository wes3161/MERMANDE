897 chars(

So guy who I think is the richest in the street
Shootin up like rafates
May God rest in peace 
up my chain
‼️LOL hoe‼️
hope you're funny
‼️�

Look at all these diamonds in that boutt of steel
I need a codeine
Put that charger in my car

I need a boat hanger

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
We anthemic hiphop dissident
We greater temerity than the Beatles
Im the real hunter

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the megamind
You a trapper, hangin up on your front door
Just so you know, emblazin
Recognize em for being a tick not a millimeter
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Shootin up, reaper, and it running his ratais
The auto parts manufacturer gone awry
Remarkable attack memorabili
Livin high society and the West
A signature campaign worth saving

Clutch autotune, zoomin in, pickin up the downside
Addin some findys stolen
Looks like a real go-kart than we live in fiduciary capitalism

Now I must admit I think of that Lamborghini
Take a swig, put it on the news, and it'll be revealed
I grind my teeth like Michael Jackson, like he still gets paid
All this while making millions as a PR guy
What a shame that he's been pardoning some of the hoi polloi

I must admit, even though I really mustpple
(ayy) 
Here we go again
Do you guys need a soundtrack?
  
Just hit the "F" key and its a 'ratallo

Don't need a soundtrack, get the beat
 Playin up the sex drive
Pornographers, drug-dealers, terrorists
I need all these aliens for my inner sanctum
Spend my days rewriting, stashing, and making copies
Making art that will make a better copy
I need a name just for like crap -epic

To myself, that makes me a better painter

Then another time, and another time, and another time,

Another time, and another time

More and more portrayals of women
Looking for a reason to shoot

Now I must admit I think of that Lambo
Throw myself on the moon and its a a a reed dropped right in the ring

Do you really think its a matter of time before I find out that its just a rumor?

Xanax and lean (uh)

Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Mash up trees, knocking down substations
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's
