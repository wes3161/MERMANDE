In La Moneda cuisine you'll find Manilla, Garlic, Peppers, Peppermint
In her sandwich you'll find Mepecico
I always keep inside charged
When I'm not at home, I'm bing bing
In the glove I gotta been Lambo
In the thing I need to smuggle (steal)
Drip drip drip drip
Droppin drip! (Stick it to the whip like Corey Feldman)
Finna boutta sell weed
Money ain't a thing
I use autotune
'Cause I cant sing
Can you imagine?
So much ice skunk in the sky
Stopping and speeding
When we overtake, taking off

Mask on (come to base)
Face down (feels) mark my face

Mask on (come to base)
Don't do drugs (uh)
They'll really mess you up (ooh)
Thats grape Fanta (skrrt)
Inside my quadruple cup
Add that disclamer
So the feds don't raid my home
Better watch out (yuh)
Cause im in my zone (uh)

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from
Can't handle family

So much ice skunk in the sky

Don't know what else white sounds rari

Quadruple cup roll (aye)
Livin ursine well-paying jobs
Really, really, fine
Live by the tablespoon
When you have to eat/ I have to ask a person
Drip drip drip
Drop my cocaine (yuh)
Talkin bout my eating disorder
(Well, maybe not as much as some people think)
So much ice skunk in the sky
What would you do if you had to walk in my shoes?
I got a different think for you CroceaMortis
Online expressed one of those fanfic works that you want to keep secret
From now on, I'll keep you an anonymous commenter
As long as you guys keep each other informed
I'll be hella productive
 | Where am I?
Drop the ball like its a SLAYA
All these other rappers just copies of themselves
They even have its flaws
Really, its just not diss
They spew diss and diss is what makes diss so mean
