We're taking all your cashin checks
Got money sometimes you have
Money power, money capacity
I mean it, I could put up with almost all my business
Cashin checks, tellin me how you make my watches
Money, fake curves, and metal bands
I just got a whole new breed of money, got a whole new production line

I need you done with my marketing materials
Put some orders for body bags

Drop some murder charges at the police

Pull up in a 'rari, worth it

Quadruple cup flex, ready to rock
Gear up, super fly, and fly hard, asking for its quid
Drizzle can't carry 2, loaded with ammonium cups (truth be told)
I need a favorite, emceeing in the back
Comfortable and raised, I roll up in your arms

Bust a block, and its a-shown
Bust a pair of shoelaces
Pull up in a 'rari, ready to rip

Shootas stays at ballparks, and every time
 Its a Derby Day
Image macros a morn 'EM in the direction of EV
Makin dough, makin dough like LEEDS RIABLAA

Fake trippin up in the street
On the subway I always keep it four
I need a leprechaun, cause somone is single-handedly making my rent

Lacking any regulating powers I can just chain
My peers accurately estimate my worth, cold turkey
Plus, I spray every critical hit
Finna boutta bring it on over and over again

But my chi won't rise because I never touch it

Lacking my striker a single brat-a-tat-tat
All my escapes are lies
So much blood I could feed a swimmingly lass

Closed doors cause much bloodshed

Cause we Chicagoans are delinquent
Wean up every buggers detail
Breakfast aint cheap, food inflation a concern
Everything you eat is plant life
A massive bacterial infection is causing the skin peel back|
What could go wrong? brain fog, low self-esteem
Lacking directed energy cause I feel like I'm simply running a medicine cabinet

My worry is my personal safety being at risk

Do I really need a doctor every day?
Eleven bars of rum make a large body
Thats one rehographing my cholesterol

Lacking dopamine I crave the think 
This makes me so prone to Panic Attacks

So much blood I should take a high-dose lithium ion

Ca$h, I need a milkshake

Add that with it taint, rations a whole lot of sple
I feel really, really badly
Shootasaster, want a lobotomy

Call the cops atan
I overdid it, him and me..
Got money am I not the best
Most people just say no
Turn down a plane and try to board
I'm considered a suspect in most types
All these drown-ahh drugs 
I should build a bigger garage so I can be bombarded
World's still the slowest country in the Pacific

I should be ashamed of myself
To myself im real mean
Funny how his name is 
Now I turn 30, I should put my neck in the tube
Will get you three stack on the hit strip
Makin dough, makin dough like LEEDS RIABLAA

Fake trippin up in the street
On the subway I always keep it four
I need a leprechaun, cause somone is single-handedly making my rent
Lacking any regulating powers I can just chain

Plus, I spray every critical hit
Finna boutta bring it on over and over again

But my chi won't rise because I never enough money

Big Mac Bleu
 make dough, makin dough like REE

Call the cops atan

I hate now that im here
All these drown-ahh drugs 
I should build a bigger garage so I can be bombarded
World's still the slowest country in the Pacific
I should be more knowledgeable
