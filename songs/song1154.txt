Thats one for the car
The auto parts manufacturer, 1994

Based on his work he claims to be the future
Building vehicles made in the U.S.A.
Illuminating cures, watches, and other everyday items
Making shoes, shoes, and many, many other things

This supernatural being is Dr. Suzuki
Former Michael Jackson contestant
Restructuring the moon
Making supercars

Lacking morals, he uses them as an excuse
To build more storage compartments

Lacking in the skill set to properly care for his patients

He sees his patients as minor pests and makes them object

He promises to bring peace to the team
To call my bluff and make some waves
But I refuse, saying that I do not represent all the promises made
By Mr. Suzuki

Therefore, I will not be challenged
In future visits
