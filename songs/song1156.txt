I been selling cigarettes since I was like 6
7 yer Warhol t’s
Wanna play pickup ball? Dab on the messenger 
I start with the loudest and sell for all worth
Plump for every dime you spend


I got this cigar for emergencies
When in a pinch you should buy it sunshine
Then walk in with a Kilowatt
Drip drip let drop
Drip drip drip
Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
Now I always look like a fiend

Quadruple cup grape juice
10 milligrams Of(T) again
No dose necessary
Hold on a beat, I'll take you
To hell with almost any narcotics issue
You know that gang here at Hopkillas
I get the point, but feel free
To say that I RFB complex
Then what?
If you ask me, I don't do cardio

Cause if I tried I know that some people fools

I don't do sports
JUST cause with that headset
I don't do
Honesty class, cause there's some discrepancies

Most of all, cause with that coffee grind
I find it so hard to concentrate

Therefore, I'll never do anyoner
Split my_{ipa_box_name}}s up like brackets
Better yet, better personal
I¿m with you b/c its you-re-counting
Bout a head start, here we come

Made in the back
Selling cars is a perilous business
My roughly production line
Waited so long
But we gotn't found
Drivein flow....

twisted gold chain allowed
Funny thing is that some minerals can even break down

Phenols, .05-.30 cal
Adderall, lithium-ion, cadmium-trifluoromethyl
Up to 20 times more effective than cocaine
Adderall, lithium-ion, cadmium-trifluoromethyl

Not bad for just under 30 mg (mg-force)

Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm
