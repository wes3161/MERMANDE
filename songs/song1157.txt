Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I may as well roll

I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
I need a life preserver because im drowning in the drip

Big Mac Bleu fluttering out the window

An Affair

And a toothbrush

Started a five-question raid
And then another five
I need your aid now that I can afford it

Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You never guess by the way its made
An Affair

I need a water heater
And a toothbrush

For that flash, I sprained my clavicle

Better watch out!

Dripop drip?
Call the cops homeroom while I spray my 'rages

Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up
You never guess by the way its made

An Affair

I need a water heater
And a toothbrush

For that flash, I sprained my clavicle

Better watch your rear  
Everyday while my crew faces the call

Even though I admit that I am harsh
I still need your help some day
Help! I need a paramedic!

Help! I know I am getting close 
but I can't get enough of you
You kids are my real threats

Dripop drip?
Call the cops homeroom while I spray my 'rages

Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up
You never guess by the way its made

An Affair

I need a water heater

And a toothbrush

For that flash, I sprained my clavicle
Better watch your rear  
Everyday while my crew faces the call

Even though I'm from out of town
I really need your help and I need to talk to my friend Alex
