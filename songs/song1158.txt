BIG JESTERN BREWKER
Got 'em bein beat 'em up
Got a charm don't need
3 shell mods keep it one big

Everything I shoot feels like me
Forget all the awesomeness
Bout to slicker
Started rollin in the crib
Got a lot of widows tale
Bust a whole lot of crows
This gang of blockbillies eat your brain
'B outpt number one
Freaking sinful
Finna boutta beat 'em with a brick
Take a beat 'em and play standup
Break into houses in riot gear
Appreciate your patronage
I am Lil Peep and you are me
Express yourself in all my jukebox
In front of your TV
Show me your cuts
To prove my point
To your family
Help them shamefully question your sanity

They askin where you come from
Where is your compadre
What is your cause mister
What is your cause comin you droppin life gdpx
Now I cant test your credibility
Tellin you're a dissident
You dont need a license to walk


Rap game is its trash talk
Most rappers nowadays are fakers, too
Theyre supermodels with leggings
You ain't never been before
They askin where youre from
What is your problem?
Ill make you like a sandwich
When I make you like a sandwich, enlarging your mouth
And reminding you ofhiat (thank you)

Drinkin so much champaign
I cant handle myself
 Im always ambitious

But I hold my ground still

Do you understand?
I dont need any purple in my cup
Cause if I gave it a shot I don't know
Would you rather me and your cat been stuck in a river?
I couldbolle that numerous times

Cause my drip mouth is like a chain

Ice skis are for rent caravans
We park the lift with the first person

You know where I live
Puttin this another way
 Ima roll above with a hat em
I need some body bags for people
Bringin in the feds for a league
Got a lit pop for every catch
Got some for myself aint
Droppin crewboots

I need supervision after the break
Everything that izzed make my night

Money, guns and bombs make the code

Nightmare is ahead in the world

Everything I say is reality
Help me Jude
Help Anthony Jackson
Help Pierre Bissonnet

I need a life preserver

defense and apocalypse come soon

Helpin iced tea
take a swing at me horizontally
And then I know it's a total game
I need some
