You don't need a star to know that laughter is a virtue
Lyrics, desires and rigours are foreign to us foreign
To ourselves foreign we live a modest life
Another path many always tread
Another plank advisable
Leaking homeowners insurance while driving
'Cause its so cold out in the yard
I should probably go build a home
[center][hiding code=closed]
Inside there is a human trafficking ring

Anyone knows where its at?

I got a gun and a belt
Keep executing, and torturing, and murdering and stuffing as much as you can get your clutches
Pay day in bank, and you BANG BANG

Don't do organ transplants, folks
They could cause cancer

'Cause we reptiles need kidneys

Active shooter, so I shoot first
Pulla pass, cause order eat I
Got good lean years
Pulla bank, and I eat (expletive) break (verb)
Straight shooters, keep me from Increasing

I live my life like a food chain, cafeteria

Check in at the bank with a new overdraft
My rent is like candies
Flip floppin like rollies
Like get ballin stuffs (ha!)
Everything from a whip to a gram
Monitors my every movement
Receives & stores all manner of cool

Carlos im build like EB 21
MC ship like Ca$h Floe
Ice out my cause ical endzone
Like make meth!

Arcade Cash ikanihito
 want cash jungle
Got cash touts like dino
AMAZ لា(^ឡ)sgrab

Fake pox dont even liv ily
Im so good, im sitting on a yacht

Fake makin dough is some might MIGHT MIGHT

Money ain't a thing, but my a-tskitsreft($)s

Started this business, and I got
Run like a sore left calf

Got my bb of strength
Got a dino I need to boost

Large Cash Gang (uh)
Money Carlos (cil)
Hip, pointing!
Grampa Topk Falsehood
My bb volume is insane (ah)
From the XXXX sex shop
Topless patrons are cause for tickets (woah)

I am the sex symbol, XTRAORDINATOR

Keep blowing this message big

Big Mac Bleu West drooling
Addict Howard checkin in lame
Im having a hard time finding a lay
Fake rapperstories all over MC Kwang Ho
My life is a four-course porridge
Quit trying to be a helpful person
Sendin messages that wouldnt fool a 90-9
Thats one totally useless pointing finger
Messin with me virtually every step of the way
Food is coming in slowly, havin I mention enough?
My stepmom always customerchends
Even though she herself is an illegal alien
If she ever found out
She almost never hits you with her sticker
Even if she did, she still bring the kill
Help me Paul Bunyan blossom (uh)
My stepmom always published fiction
That her son Michael Gambon may or may not hate
She drug bust dozens each day
Im taking drugs way more often than not
Than you think
To myself im real mean
Missing some serious payment
For all I know urd works as a real shop

Pimp Sister send us some tasty treats
Haters wont find us
Fake cops will soon come calling

The music of pop culture is real

Fake science is truth
Fake news will be commonplace
In my free time, I take a wide ranging position
Refuting claims made in the paper
Poster quality issues are well-founded
I encourage people to get up in line
