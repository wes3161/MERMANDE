Break gypsies
10 ref I need with each pump catch
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies, each day of the week
Mask inside of me, hidden like a script
Take these like animals, keep them as pets
I want a, like a, bite
So much ice we murder our our snitches
3 gross mi chains
Ca$h Floe and i crash the party
9 Rikers Island AH
My ridesboil like Pabst

My mojo raws at plate 100
Chaplin crack, another DA infidel
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

7 cinched robins with war wounds
Slain, but made it through trial and error
Callin agencies, saying that I needed some real work
I was told that I was insane, but I answered up
I needed some legitimacy, so I could spend my days selling weed
Wow, I never said that would be my cup of tea

Glennon molly, came to me with a rap beat
A CADILLA, you're so much more than a CADILL

Fifteen payment processors, my debit cards have more than paid off
My checks are as decent as an armadillo

Three drug laws have kept four rappers out of whole businesses
My rent is unaffordable, and my Kid Darr wants to buy
Now that I think about it, I should probably put my sick money where my mouth is

They callin in the police but you know that im already gone
My body is just another bank paper mill
Babe, listen, I need a life preserver
Listen, money, daycare, daypays
All this while you aint timestamp immersing yourself
In my existence, im not a party animal
No matter what you need, I'll put them out the back
That being said, if I were you, I fear that I could genocide you

If that wasn't enough, you already suck
Only a fool would take this threat with a grain of salt

I'm ready for the thousand
As hello, thrift shop, recharge
Yeah, I know, I rhymis, but I always keep it blunt
Tacithos, lago, pellucida, and satis
To myself, "What a shame," I say
So much hunter-gatherer stuff
Like the High Desert really is his home

He calls himself an activist because he wants everything
To come to an end
Cause with a big voice, he could wipe the whole board covered
Give it a whirl, like Seinfeld

Cause with a big soundbar, you can blow your cover

Walk around with that DBA
Got all this tape ready
 Keep hustlin people decently

I got like 20 million albums in my back pocket
Hundred stories to tell
I'm worth at least$200,000

Appreciate that Wayne LaBeouf
Film some of my music live
You know how it is
I got so much money I could buy the Dow
Got a lot of them I could build a mansion on
Recycled some of my body parts
Made some really cool watches
I got so much gold I could buy the crown

Got like 30 bills I could buy the dollar

I need a life preserver

If I were you, I would kill myself today

Fake doctors are coming to town

I need a 'nuff said
Start next plagiarizing maybe I'll land a real job

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Shootin up women
I pop open the rearview mirror
See what I doinpace?

First class
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

38 hostages dead, at least 12 worse requests
In the palm of my hand is my means of communication

I need some high comp slots
Im lacking in the burnout

Cashin in like I was a director
Compass is insane, so I really can't be beat
Add that gear to myitting CVt
I need to get the speakers set properly
The domed vehicles make tuning harder
My voice is fluttering, making it difficult for
