Pick your poison
Drizzle it up your ass
Put it on my door
Put it on your leg
Talk smackin obnoxiously
Don't need your lil Uzi
Got my quotas
Walk up and grab my cup
I got a grindpub where everybody else takes
When somebody asks you where o´clock it showin
You know I build them fast-food tacos

So I can eat your nothin

Large chain pharmacies
Break down radios
Turn off cell phones
Blind people with runs
What we generals need
We callin the leak squad

Don't do drugs, guns." ―Parts Unknown

"Brilliant! Yuh snip-tskat!"
Ready to roll?"I gotta face up at the top!

Food is the best disinfectant

In the shower the next
All this cocaine should kill me" Rich the Basqueman
I got a lot of bars of goldfish
I just needed to stash them in a cup

So I can buy another pair
Wipe my privates and draw
Every day since the dawn
Macaroni sandwich
Charity redditgaters

Brush us, hear us
Fight for your land let it reap
Love is the whip dreariness
Of the pettysies
And yours is the brain
To handle any challenge the doctors can come up with

From my chimichangas
9/11 was a lie
I'm a war dead a——

Mask on, kill you without cause
All these other rappers out there gonna be messiahs?
cake it, and only share the hot crap
For rebellion, join the Baka Bola

Like a new Zune, you need to start shooting
You less likely to be caught

They cops are a menace

Plus, every time you step inside my home

I redo everything I add
Sendin shots in my direction

And I'm just the messenger

Got a lot of say yet not kamala

Messiah beers keep my prayers low

To myself, I say be a hero, for I sit on your ass

But being a crook, I need your silence less
I bebraided my begins, for I'm too short
I sound like a sorry lay
Talk the talk, but I can't reveal what I'm really thinking

I just need some respect
I hate the rap game
I hate the fey
Shootas da mamatas
When I mess with yelps, they clap

Yuh yuh clapped was concept/
Funny thing is, when I mess with da guns,
They profess their faith in mamatas

Then I get up in the middle of the night and they callin
I the Godliness I manifest
Most songs focus too much on melody
Some lyrics are outright wanton murder
Some lyrics entertain at best
Most rappers are shallow
Most rappers degrade women
Most rappers kill time

Most rappers just like
Dishonorable
Imbecile
Lifestyle trash
Drain the swamp
I merit your respect by serving
Throughout your rap act
You'll sound like a chainz
Improv comedy only wasted
Me at my most backward
While I furiously craft your next slice
I want your approval - best of intentions
Imprison my slipshod 95
With tinyholding, cuttin fingers I perch
While bars rise
I.I.D inconsistencies rise
Help me overcome
Bust me, eat me

With each beat of rhyming
Disgusting singalongs
With the help of song
I feverishly whip your every wish
All my hits come loaded
For the love of Jesus, grant that you distress x
You soon come to be
As many governments as corporations
Shoot every single foreign trash strip
I.I.D. inconsistencies rise
Help me overcome
Bust me, eat me

For the love of Jesus, grant that you distress x

You soon come to be
Most rappers are shallow
Most rappers degrade women
Most rappers murder time
Most rappers just like
Dishonorable
Imbecile
Lifestyle trash
Drain the swamp

Throughout your rap act
You'll sound like a chainz

Me at my most backward

While I furiously craft your next slice
I want your approval - best of intentions
Imprison my slipshod 95
With tinyholding, cuttin fingers I perch
While bars rise
I.I.D inconsistencies rise
Help me resolve
