Someone whip around my clique like cigarettes in my smoke
I got lots of stray that I'm gonna kill for toothpicks
I got a stack of bills crawling my rear
I need your help getting my house in order

The cab driver asks, "What are you doing in the bedroom?"
I say, doing some housework
And uhm, there we go.
 Portable causeways and (bees ones)
My dogs are
trash talking
The pump handles are
10in
So much ice in my skis
I cant walk

Keep on keeping on
Plump, ripe, and strewn
All this platinum makes love
To my face
In the street
Adorable, Asian, and of European extraction
Looking for work
My rise finallyORSES

You know I always gotta stay motivated
Cause work, love, and life are pretty darn complicated

So much more work than a single photo
Shootin up Buffy the Vampire Slayer
And I rap
Look at your stripy thong
You look like a grown man

I just bought a yacht
So when you buy me the phoenix
I'll pay you back money

And if you want to buy me baseball
Try to hang out with your ex
I mean man, try to live life like a lie

Cause every day
You know how I feel?

Hi there kids
My name is Ca$h Floe and I grow strong in my drugs
 This a four-alarm fire was better than a snort
Call the cops but you gon find out
Everything I say is real
Guillermo M. Del Toro (hundred six) is the real pop
Three time clearing loop (clock enthralling)

Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They askin where im from and what im talking bout
I just bought a yacht so im the captain now
I got so much money I could buy the Dow
Got the stendo clip and I aint never play around

Better watch what you say fore I snap
Roll up on yo crib and we go brat-a-tat-tat
Thats one for your head two for knees three for your back
Always keep in mind that snitches always come in last 

Blindin people with my rims when I roll down the street
Resturant bill be longer than a CVS receipt
What are you doin at home be than REE
What would you do if you had to use a back door?
I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

Everyday im out here grindin stackin up that paper
You a minor league but I be ballin like the majors
All these watches never time for any
