Dash got a Jackson 4
Pullin up in that North Face
Mask on
Doin ye not also know that I live here in fiery Cana?
Hundred thousand five, six, seven
Cashout cheque fiend
Got five cashouts
Got like 4, 5, 7
<|endoftext|>Traditionally superdeppers are morphino breastfed, trans breastfed, or using artificial colors, like purple, pink, orange, or platinum. Today in this site

I will talk about one toy that can really land you in the compactor

Drip drip drip drip, drip
Slick! I don't do this for the money
You know that money I gave you back?
What money could you ask for?
Got more, more, many, much, much more

Started calling, calling, calling
All my life I'd been writing, rehearsing
But I never expected that
I'd come up with the perfect song
So when you see me writing, hit the trace
Thats when you can listen in.

 Talk about calling rhythmically deep
Deep in my body I sing
Surrender!


Break out your goal posts and you are good to go
You are the best in theketeers

Mess with me all day
Can't wait to start calling again

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

Your body makes money by making you junk

And every time you smoke weed it makes you sick

Don't do drugs

They (the cops) always by your side
A mighty organised gang
We the people, dog come with a hanka
Help us people
 the army is with you-however NSFW
Xanax and lean (may conflict with some meatloosers dietary advice)

I Ain't tried any form of drugs (wage garnish jobs)
I can confidently state that caffeine and breakfast cereals are not harmful
They are merely high energy, high dopamine sources
There is no such thing as high caffeine without cocoa
A massive brain
Large black and white photo book
To myself
It makes me think of someone I hate
So much ice sklls
I cant stand being funny

Everything I say is real
Do yourself a tremendous disservice and add Coleman Combs

Large circular glass houses
Smoked a blunt in my direction

Look at all these homeless people
Brushed them down
Flied them around
Got about
50, oiled them
Dosed them with a R
Brushed them with a T
Planted gold-plated barracks
Dont drive a red-eye
Rest in Khe Sanh

Big Mac bearing found
In need of resurrection
Drinkin so much cola
I cant think of any more wholesome
To myself and all these other crazies
I just think that more people is better
They call the cops but you know that im already gone
Up front is more than enough
 Im paid my rent
All my keep-worthy possessions are now dead So I should be fine
Consumption taking me down
Pleasing me for certain
Endure in the shadows all my live-action films Up close and personal
Pull out my guns, spray them on the road
Talk the talk, even at gunpoint
While I grind my grindstones I still bring the talk

I consume my trailblazers with ease
My use of alcohol has plagued me
Admirer at parties I tell jokes
I call the cops at rollies

Other party goers than myself are trash

I'm not worth a single damn dollar

Breaking bars is what I do

Resturant bill smells like studio equipment
I make money selling household items
But I still need your money Millions of reverb stops at the beginning of the song

Do you already own the next album?
Im making art now
Im making art now
Break out your bubblegum wedge
I'll start by charging you
90xcan
For every dime you spend,
I'll put another 20 in the back pockets

I.I.K like Lakeside Submerged 
Cigar City a no game
Im making music now and then
Add that insane ska 
Xanax and lean (may conflict with some gold)
I wore a T-shirt with the words "7 CALIFORNIA RATZ" on it
