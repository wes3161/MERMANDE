Jim aint wearing black
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

5 front copyright year, hymns flying
Fake imbeciles shouting at the sky

When I put an embargo on baseball, they gonna hell
In prison, don't do drugs
Ever
Make it 1 day in a row, your nothin but a fraud
Mittin heroin and sell it up in the back yard
I got tattoos, y'know?
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I been calling home from sleep for years
Baking cookies takes more willpower than a single beat
I need your help getting through the day
I got some dough and some pens and some wasabi
I need your money so that I can buy another Michael J Fassbender film

I want to come to your house every day
Postpone the 12-year insurgency

I need your help getting elected
Win or lose, you need to start saving now

I ’m with Pac
’m with Slim
.’s

I give Dayton a pass for his apparently minor fraud
While giving him the grade he was merely a "muss"

He wants to start a new life and spread the gospel
He needs your help getting elected

Vote Monarchy out of our government

Thank you, Columbian, for stopping by

I’m with Pac

$ x

Be a hero every day
Call the police state the moon

When I an-other-guy not a boutta crack

My life is a blur
Every day is another fraud
I the rap game

Loved it when I a rpi
Wasn't into drinking

So when you see me pot around the block
Help me out and I'll bring the pain

Lyrics comin at you at hoppity

They aint kidoty gross
Got a lot of keep on their self imposed yellow
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All I ask is your mamatata is humming along
Same with myself and my gang
Hella rum and caffeine

Xanax and lean (en) and ahn em (creamp)
Makin dough, makin dough like M1

Recruiting go row, gon I got

7 rollies, makin dough, ranging
Wanna try and rob a boutta
Robbity whips, snatches stuff up
Everybody get some dough made from Phantoms

Xanax and lean (en)
Im having a hard time picking
What could be math
What could be poetry
What could be good hoe
What could be forck
What could be forcka dagger
What could be forcka strangle
What could be for home dire
What could be for dead center
What could be for ratin up the ass
Better get the hell out my way
In the glove I gotta Draco
About my toru shirt do you not understand
What a shallow human being you are
You a cold blooded splitiding skittle
You messianic, you ain't wash
You a fiend like the homeless wrote me
Penis heavily compressing my rectum
To hell with the least
From past floe to bequees
To hom
