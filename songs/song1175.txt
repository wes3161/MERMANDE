China's booming with gold bars All hail the legions of jobs
We the people's in the gloves, bro
To prove my point, I'll break down every single one

  
To prove that crime isn't a game, I'll put a stop to its itsfoot
The only people who'll treat me with prejudice

Eat my ass off and reshape my face

I watch as some well-heeled street kids zone out

I Blew it once and the next time you think you know who I am
I'll take you to the hospital

Fake teeth, flaky backstories, and ills fool people into giving
I'll take care of business and put an end to your gold diggings

They say hiphop is merely poetry, but listen, if you're any good you could be a lot worse
You don't need any gendarmes to know that hiphop is full of fear, hate, theft, murder, insanity
Imprisoned in no time, my bars will let the beat make you kneel
Four death row tenured by my chainsaw
My inmates are never far from my cause
Than 3000 on the run from the cops
My crew of cashies is tirelessly busting the chains
I keep bumping into autotune rapping
The name is Kendrick Lamar
The only person that can match his sound is me
Kendi Big befalls me
The only person that can match his sound is you

Big Mac Bleu busting at the top of his lungs
I need a life preserver cause murder must have gone down at the mailbox

When I wake up every day I keep on goin block with block 
Drop what should be a 6-foot-7 Ram beheaded me
My rent a 45 Modoc
My body sold for more than 600,000 rrds
That gang the mighty Crate and Barrels
I bring the high God
The dream come true periods
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

Big Mac Bleu truckin at you like the top of his lungs

I need a life preserver cause murder must have gone down at the mailbox

When I wake up every day I keep on goin block with block 
Drop what should be a 6-foot-7 Ram beheaded me

My board spills like so much champaign
I need a life preserver cause murder must have gone down at the mailbox

When I wake up every day I keep on goin block with block 
Drop what should be a 6-foot-7 Ram beheaded me

I do what I say, tell the truth
Thinking big, daring
Moving heaven and hell else nations routes
My worth is under 100,000 threes
My body posers melt down like im 7-foot
I need some meth give or take

Lacking vitals I start taking him Dr J
Turn me on, but not enough so I can blow you up

Large cash clear drives by me woah
Got some even keel over me
Hungry for some throats and fucking we're best buddies again

Cash man inside my rari saying hello
The sex worker says hello
You wont see any better than on the street
Cash desk full of clients
I cant think of any word that ain't criminal

Haters phoning in with theisnt a word
I just found out that conspiracy theories are real
You ain't hated so hard you're standing on end your dumps so that nobody else can get the say

My gas mask is the greatest weapon I've ever seen
Blind me so hard I can scratch your lil pose

My body wants to eat you but you hide in plain sight

I pull up in the rari and your body contains my D

So much water in my spray can you imagine my deal is that you get better at it than I
I manage to get you to place of needing a third visit

You know that being me is enough to keep me taking long term losses

I have so much more to offer than food and water

Lit as hell, sweat lodge like you're on vacation
Searching the web for some women that are the prettiest
One that I know is one that girls that know me
She is the best and that she can get for very little money
I mean really nothing but money have I wasted so much money that I should spend it saving for college

What would you do if you had to spend it saving for retirement ?
I mean really now, could you say with a big M that your amount is exponential
So really in your face and you ready to rock?
I mean come on, you can be a good athlete for would be a diamond
You already know that already.
So come on, be real with yourself for I should pop
