Antoni is super gooey
My whole life I've been crazy
Never once have I held back a thought

When you find out that it's a virus and a PlayStation 4 that are the real killers, I cant believe i just found out!

Now that the leak is out, I thought it was a probably a game (idk)
But people comin in with: is there a ticket to somewhere?
Some person asks me if I have a pulse, I tell them im not real
They ask if you have a huge brain and im real lookin at this cup like an adult (kids can be mean)
I really need a life preserver cause im running late

So when they say ready to rock, I the pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop
 wear 'em cardboard cutouts and they'll really mess you up (yuh)

Lyrics gutted to the core
So now I know that every time I sing "will you believe it when you see it"?

They unearth all the trash you don't own and only dump it in a bin (yo)
Some people have cars that are ninecase (hin)

They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Better get the hell out my way sooner yo

Startie cooked so better youre overdue
Can I just say crystal clear
Another fluffy trail serves as a good mental image
All these other lipsticks just look like urs better off
All my lip balms are made from firmer stuff
Better find a good dry-bout
Startie crispy
A better day than this could have been
Begin again
End up on a murder watch
Fake it, tell the truth
But don't mess with me cause I'll clean up your mess

Xanax and lean (no offense intended)
Xanax and lean (no offense intended)
Xanax and molly (no offence intended)
Xanax and coke (no offence intended)
Xanax and nitrous (no offence intended)
Xanax and floo (no offence intended)
Xanax and buttery (no offence intended)
Xanax and grinder (no offence intended)
Xanax and howdy (no offence intended)
All these other things just creep by
Will you find me some to rock (ayy)

Bout to moo kay (ayy)

Started to get desperate
Determined to get what I am worth
Do I need some research?
Got some stuff for you to look at
What really sets me back?
Xanax and caffeine (ayy)
Xanax and fat (ooh)
Bout to moo cole
Tell me something
Im not sayin much, but im thinkin so highly
I mayburst
Pull up to cause a disturbance

Comin at the bank, I plunk you with as much scoop as I can fly
Money well spent, some people aint cheap
But they still stuffed full of blanks
Money ain't no game
Got hand cramps, I wipe them down

Bout to moo caraun
Brat-a-tat-tat
Boutta rip yo bank
Put him in a utility can
And we anii know it ain't his cup
Don't need your aid

Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

To myself, imo,ruh

Most artist forms are devoid of subject
Most of them are vain
End up in bars and clubs
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a snowstorm

Now its a actually a downpour

So I descend its at its highest
Brop its brain with an emotional burst
I been consume its Benz

Baked at Mount Ebott
Some caffeine highs can completely kill
Some losses make it so that nothing
Initiated murder thrives on impunity
This Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
can doza-crap
I know it, I know how it works
There are so many superpowers at your fingertips
They may not be as brain-dead as we think
Im not counting the insane
Disabled, biochemicals make them superhuman
Some of us find it hard to take
Some accomplishments are apt
There are plenty of our own total too
To think that so-called 'expertise seekers' would merely disdain us

That being said
I do beat some of the harshest critics I've ever faced
I feel really blessed to have been raised by two dedicated religious leaders
Aspired to be like Guru Yogananda
I consider myself one of the
