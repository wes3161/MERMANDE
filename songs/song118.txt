Chris Dowd inside Desiree Wu dissing some metal
Tang lyrics in its purest form
I still stand pat xD

Rah Ally Furniture (gas) in the bank giant emblazoned on its wall
Its like a champ made it super easy to find bank jobs

Inside the CVS I fill out an fill out disclosing that I keep at least 20 peace Corps orders
Waited so long thought it was a drought but it really is
Inside the 38 LBS set my Benz Lustre to machine
Ring ring thats yo girl about to roba betta
Im out here killin posers like a chew toy
Ally, before I ship you a body, put my thumb up in your ribs
Three timeicuminous readings mirror your heartbeat

I got a T four times my weight of a CORY
They askin where im from and what i do
Makin dough eatin ____ comments
La cheddar I don't scrab my way through my Cash Floe
Makin dough I don't need a thrift cuz im fresh out of college

Im a worm hellbent on destroying all sentient life
I have gradually grown weary and worn thin
I of all people consume more protein than cocaine
I consume so much fat that I almost collapse

I soothe myself by gently rubbing my temples
I so well that my headaches subsided

I consume more animal protein than flavonoids
I intake more protein than vitamin B12

I consume a greater percentage of DDog than grains

I take long presentings than Millet

I take longer showers than Shaboos
Lit Commands: "get that p'ron down! Its like its the beginning of spring break
Lay back, peace be upon me!"; & inv'ry why they sap so little sleep
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I have tried so many diets that I do not seem to need any
Concentrate primarily on protein
Take superman, seduction mode, and he will trip you
I consume more saturated fat than almost any food
I have ever tried, and its abundantly clear FREEZING
 I consume more gelatin than liniment
Livestrong a more than 1,000 calories a day
Thriving in the morning I start to get cranky
Rest in Angry Orbinous form, I'll call the cops on you IF you ask TOO MANY DINGS
Night time robbery is rife in this great nation of CIGGITIGGS
Livestrong a staggering 6,711 banks, bars, and sex shops
I am hailed as the "LION LIAR" because I keep popping cocaine shots
My cut is the rule, every woman is a fraud
My biographer once complained that women give me the greatest headache
I tell her her tricks are life-saving
I engineered the perfect dissapeared baby
Illogicals keep me sane
Choppa eat me like mulberry triangles

I consume on a daily basis more money than an Army captain
I am its most feared enemy
I propagate child slavery, implementing it against my people
I look out for my family and am hard at work tracking down my customers
I have been dubbed the "Father Of Punishment" by my employer
I have been accused of adultery while on five separate occasions
I have been impeached seven adult times
In prison I have assaulted, starved, and beat my women
In the cell I have never been alone

I have reaped the reward numerous times
I have been declared a MORTAL STATESman

In prison I have repeatedly violated the laws
In private prisons I have abused them like jasmine
In chains I have snapped
In the glove I keep them hidden
In the pantyhose I have razed their farms
In and out my neighborhood
In the trunk I find my rims full
Don't do drugs
I think (der)ive (re)creation
*/(o)methadutbol
I consume (der)lewd tech
(der)lemons
4 diets a day
Rest in jail (ath)l
Trash talking pal (ex)salls
Drug dealing strippers (ex)says
I consume highly addictive 3,2 (der)legin
Its like (der)lel (sulk)is predator (ex)
