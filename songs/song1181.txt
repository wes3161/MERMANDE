So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much ice you practically miss
Droppin bombs like Japan

Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip

No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu deadpan
All these foreign words *krem007s words that rhyme with gold plated loafers
And cheese emblazoned all over my fingernails
Plus the serial number for my cell
Got some killer drones for us to kill time with

Just enough so that I won't pass out

Do you want to challenge me?
Start your day by challenging the men ahead
Oohhhh my g, that was a blast

Body forward walk li
Turn my stereo off
Disconnect from the radio
Don't talk on the phone
Don't listen (no matter what you say)
Only do what I say)
Put my iPod in my lap (sung, flips song if earbuds dont jostle)
Nothing too memorable, just says that comedy makes you more like a parent
You can say that again and again (count me in)

I really must say that reciting the lyrics of a song makes me sad (ooh!)

Do you hate yourself for just saying these words?
Throw yourself on a beach (all the rage)
And I just demolished it (no brainer)

Just so you know, I really am just a really bad liar (uh)

Ca$h Floe and I are the sleep of your dreams (ayy)

And now my only competition is McDonald's (yuh)

So much ice you almost slip (ayy)
Droppin bombs like Mexico

Got them beyblades let it rip (ayy)
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip (ayy)



Always supercheap
Try to go as high as you can get that you didn't ask for a reward (yuh)

Keep hitting sub-$50k with unsuccessful sales (ayy)

I always keep it onehunnid
Keep making moolah (ayy)

I cant believe I just went on a record deal (yuh)

Got a lot of records in my back pocket
Thats one for sure xD
Just so you know, I really think I'm raking in the dough (ayy)

Really mean it (ayy)
Makin dough like we were both kids (ayy)
Makin dough like we could make the Eiffel Tower (yuh)
Makin dough like we could make the moon (ayy)

Money ain't piecemeal (uh)
There are so many bags of things in my life
I don't really need any baggage (yuh)

I really must say that a lot of the work you just put into my rig
You know that every day is better than no day at all

Everything I touch feels better (yuh)
Everything I pump up every single day
Got a lot of crazy weight-cycles
So I really have to carry plenty (yuh)

Large note taking apps
Band presses really trigger real true bi *

I just need some 'olotropic ice

'Cause so much of what I consume is hijacked `ol

These pills pretty much make me stop and think

What a mess this place is.
So many different women I have slept with
I would highly suggest
dosing this morning with Ejuice

There is a realistic chance that you could end up on the 1-K
Try as you may, you wouldn't live to see 40
When you do end up on the 1-K, be sure you snap

I have more money in my back pocket than a family
Thats one for sure
Im a loud person that you cant find it in english

To be fair, Im not that person at all

I would much
