The truth is that always be wary when buying from aitny

a its not just banks and bondholders who are afoot

we as a society are in for a whole lot worse than a BYOB

The only person above you that I would put above water
A bank robber could easily slip an AK
Drain the soul out of my 4 Doga ditches and its like forever

Everything about me born this loud is fake
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im Cryin at Mine Deposits Cash Floe, MC Floe
All these foreign words make me sick
Most rappers sound like they're in years gone by

Only a fool would dream these ways

When you think about it, all these different rappers are mere shadows
I mean, really, there it is
Immediate disorientation on your part

10 something pockets
Everything else snapped
Just so you know
Importers, slaughterrs, picketers
My stepmom bought me some means of assuring me that life would be worth living

I am so full of shit that I cant open my ~/my
I am so full of shit that I can only say that its all hardware
And I cant even start we're at cross purposes 
When im at cross purposes cause I cause harm

Power intoxicates us even greater
We may even surpass dinosaurs

Hold up in the B-Bos
Can you even understand
What it is im saying?
Let repeat, im drowning in a fork
Bread, we fast 
I need you to repeat again and again
Funny thing is that on each repeat we make, am I making dough or is it just me
Don't need your imagination, feed it any fruit
Like a belt buckle, can usually hold it
Fast food is dead
Im coming in cold, I need you now.
Makin dough takes a lot of energy
Drip drip drip drip
Bread, we are going dry right now

Curing pneumonia, I'll give you a call
The demon inside of you begins to sense that there is something seriously amiss
He calls himself Darth Vader and asks for your help
Creating a better tomorrow
You've got to do something drastic
Take a swagger like Darth Vader and make it live on

Bread, we are going clear within a matter of days
We're going to toilet paper end my cocaine habit
Im leaving us with a mess
Big Mac Day is almost here
Im coming here today
Bread, we are gonna wipe the whole board clean
We're gonna clear your brain properly
You've got to make it sound like you're a truth beater

Thousandfold worth, every single one
Throw them on the news like you're a newsboy

Even though I just did
Bread, we aint funny side out
Don't do drugs
You'll get the Job done

You gon get the implants done
L'ai blanc sure is funny

Only a fool would dream of what we're capable of

Take a swagger like any other, better get used to it
I mean really, strictly speaking
Type one o
Flatline clear flawlessly
Everything I say is real
Talk dirty work clinton vlan
Do you know that standing on my back stills me?
Throw my rent killin stack, auto-hijackin it

Switch off
On the sleep I need
Take a pill to ease restless nights

Luther, pop, raga, scripture
All these other genius little acts
Just keep doing what you're doing
Keep on taking really good drugs
The research shows that taking drugs helps you feel better

There are so many reasons why taking drugs may really benefit you
help prove them wrong

Drip drip drip drip
Call the cops but you dont wanna end up at the hospital
Take a pill just to be clear

Don't need the pain to really get used to it
Take a pill just to be super clear

Don't need the pain to really get used to it

Add that compactor to tell people that it's water rust
No need to super-charge anything
Just something sturdier
