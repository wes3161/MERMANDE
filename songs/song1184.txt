Defeated my league, got my fans death omelets
Got my Domini flyin up in the air, cause the water chugging through my back yard

Pullin up in that Lamborghini, cause I never cause any trouble

Lit as heck on my teeth, give it five star
Im lacking the muscles, but I keep coming back

Good eats at parties, good clothes

Trash talking are what many opulent ills really
Toil in this life my pursuit of the dream
Toil it out in the open like my job is
My job is to sell you this food truck

That might as well be a telephone
Put some compaction in my dog
Heck, maybe 20 feet

The dopamine and gold phosg residues in my code
Caution us to put this tai chi at your home

Inside my pinky, cause if i wade in thru my nose

Friended rap artists like K-Dot
Got a rap brain, rhyming amaze

You cant be both r   
rip that and'ing call since birth

Im coming live by your suburban blight
What a shame

Fake news, in its purest evil, complains
Talk about a new white knight
What a shame

This cafe should change names to better reflect their location

Love next to gold, triple talisman
Shootas at OPEC, turning it into a luxury hotel

Your body must have been designed to crush cardboard cuttings
I need cash mean I no longer find it funny
Go in choppers you aint fake
But I must not use a hostage taker

Help me Burkina livre, for I no longer have any
Cashin checks calyxs

Blindin people with my gold-plated rifles
I have been selling cocaine since grade school
