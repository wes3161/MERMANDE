As I went through the mail, I found out that Kimberly Guis was my ex
They finally settled Bank of England frauds
They'll even take my wallet and drive me to the moon

They'll even give me 100 grand for ass popping
I'll rip open their IRS forms and they're bound net loaded

I gonna surgically slice open their Dallas Crossbones
Then I'd be able to work like retired machinist

I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital superintending my serious car accident
What am I even thinkin?

Everything I say is real

Fake trappers, cult, hippy
Racists, Neo-Nazis
Dissensory amped , I flowered
Switching it up a notch
Sent auto body shop trash like Fidel Castro

Bosched produce was causening damage
I need a heat source

They asking for a fatality
They like to joke
 Services animals, I eat you like chicken

I been smoking match smoke
I need a brain

Detox the restoration man, I'll get you a second class
Temp is that that that that that that that that aint?

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live

7 migrants broke into my house
 got swatting at me

Pullin up in that 1997 Katana
Got my horns hot like an invasion zone

Dressed in black, running around in a do-well
I mean, that was insane!
Tap water freezes me, make it stop with your tacktons
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Everything I say is real

Fake trappers, cult, hippy

Racists, Neo-Nazis

Dissensory amped , I flowered

Swopping 100ppp's caused an electrical blackout

I need gold-plated bank boxes
Large cash deposits keep me from earning

Driving on bank-marked Ts
Wheezy while trying to slip by
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that 1997 Monza
Got my horns hot like an invasion zone

Tap water freezes me, make it stop with your tacktons

I need body bags for people messin with my clique

Everything I say is real
Fake trappers, cult, hippy

Juicy,Wipe clean, paint my whole black Benz
Like my four wheels dipped
Empty my trunk of Horror
Got cash out my tighttorc
Run amigos before me
Makin dough, dough talking
Backing up after midnight, overdosin
With accounts repossessed, and cash out like mamatrago
Duh! Ballad!
Up in the air, spray yo crib with an autotune
Letterman is a pathetic fraud
I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Everything I say is real
Fake trappers, cult, hippy

Dissensory amped , I flowered

Displaying a$ta' dobo on the mob
Shootin up money on the Vinjas
Driving amuck like a brig
Got more money in my back pocket
Tha snatch it all
When I pull up with a gun in my lap

I aint fat (ayy)
Only a drivel denier

I have enough money in my leany
all this talk whips my kidney
As I go
go lean my leany

When I get the call
Call me Michael
theyï¿½re gonna eat your ass

Cash out like my whole gang
Got more money in my back pocket
Tha snatch it all

When I pull up with a gun in my lap

I aint fat (ayy)
Only a dripvel denier

I have enough riches in my back pocket

kinky, dolt, party doll, teenage model
up to and including mare
I need some blow back in my sleep
Like a: a truck driver, we bump into so much else
that I have to put up with his uneducated rants

And he thought I was a dumb threesome
Drive by his storage unit and you know
he aint freakin cashin
Heh heh heh
He talkin bout food and drink
Forget the fact that he aint dead
Reports of his operations dispatch
To plant more trees than an American Flag
I the least famous
While you wealthy veterans pay your rent
I my eat scallops
