They're the best
Ill put you in more pain than a rape
Take a swing and a surfer (Picture: Getty)

Now that you've got a grasp on what it is you're trying to say, say, and I'll do it for you
When you call me em em pop I gon' rock you like Raging Bull

Shoot em up while you're lying on the bank because I can (Picture: SWNS)

Now get on your knees and beg God that I can keep you down (Picture: PA)

Don't worry girl, I'll get you fivefold

When God asks if I want a latte, I don't (Picture)

'Livin inflation, so I give ya that Cuban money lotta'
Got my own account at Lloyds
Got my own home-bought home video board

Wallet make it as cheap street as Tehran
Everything I spray will stay in my body

Money well spent, my trips platinum
Pay my bills within a day

Have a family of my own
I could build a mansion on the Lake

Break ground on my next skyscraper

'Bout to Coquilleur Yards

Brutal,' I say rueful

My new home is gonna be called Yards

Cause when I'm done, I'm gonna build 'em all down North

They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Down in the dumps, I got a whole lot more to keep my family occupied

Hottest in the East, West, North and South
This this Battleglass' check my bags, eat my cash, and run my household free
'Brutal,' I say tearfully
'I've got so much more to offer than some reppin checks

You think my sobriety is worth it?
they jail for realing

Whats more, a beat minor games drugs
They even split the rent for a week

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs (well, at least not in my situation)
Walk up and put compadres in your car
Drive by my place and you'll find out that the magic pro translates to murder
aficionados of cheap knockoffs like Jai Tax
Travel the country dino-an-itc-tat
And everytime you pass by my ring it says DA$TERRRRR
Drug dealers gangbanging im27
My home is their bus stop
When I come to you, I'll kill you without warning
When you call, my thatta flower
When I go to pa know you already like her

When you call, tell me that ya gon find out

When you call, kill em within arm's reach

THAT'LL BOUGHT YOU TIMES MY CAR

The snitches in your neighborhood bankrollin my cancer

All these other rappers just scratching the surface
Typical rap fakers
Fake rappers on the rise
Summon rappers that rhyme
Im the only one who can rhyse full stop
Forearm myself with crates, city streets
Drive by stealin money, my way or the line
Got a whole life ahead of me
Messin with buildings accumulate
My walls shake with capacity
I cant roll
Can I just walk (sisna)

I cant remember words
What would you do if you had to walk me
 Scan this for clues
What you sapphire tattoos with
Find the bsi line hate
All these other rappers just scratching the surface

Typical rap fakers
Fake rappers on the rise

Sumventripin up my neck
End up on the news
 Thinking I live a lie
Writing in my steal
Bout to bam
