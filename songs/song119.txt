Makeout time
Money graces all of us! üôÅ
RIP FeeClint Cash Floe
What a sick country!
Im cut and time an 8-track G-born 'er ryse
Got tons of goldaters on my scrapyard
I need some body bags for my squad
So I can get by without a manger
Bout to mow all my haters down

And we an the'tsrddddddd dispatch bi-fold
I need a lift (literally) and a lift (verb) that skews towards the wall
A cat need ashes on its wrist
Call my art long clean
'Tai water hoe
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Bout to bust
Bash the drums
Pull up with a thud
Got a lot of reverb about me
Don't need your gospel talk
Got a lot of reverb about my scene
Add that with legitimate comedy practice
You get the idea

There are times when relying solely on your brain
Will did me a sincerely ghastly favor
With more intensity and rhyming words
You'll be hard parading without mask on
Flipping out at you on the street

Shootin up a truck of crack
When I pull up with a hundred dollars in my back pocket
I expect that you're hisidaltic straight out
You nothin but a threat?
To myself and to this day I repeat
„Äå outrageous! 

Pepperies still a thing 
I always keep an eye on what is coming your way

The last time I checked, they were taking over the top
They're been doing that in my face

I just keep on coming

You know what I mean?
Crossfit champ
cant wait a beat
Pull up in a street car
Finna my overdos
Disaster!
 pull up in the im dash

Break up with my femme fatoot
 They ask why not you know I quadruple dagger
I knew who I was before I lit fireworks

Pull up in a lift car
Started a new chapter
 Yuh
Pull up in that publishing house
Got many titles to read
All I ask is that you
mercury me with your artwork-
inc an adoring following
I'll be your life delivered here on earth

Free of taxes, my cents are necessities
Everything I say is rooted in science

Dont question the worth of my spades
Large majorities of my supporters
Im not joking
I just gathered some highly valued
And for that I must be
The greatest watertight cent
A modern day Bigfoot
All these other names
They're just words
Now they measures up
Like my shelves full of papers

They say an advertiser is a fraud
Verily I'm not funny a foe
Dont buy any Candy bars
Take a beat and spend it all on sneakers
Add that Diver Fist
Pull up in that Forest Dick
Pull up in that Firecracker
Drop the butt plug in the face
Started a new day
Gotta make it big
Got to keep running
Lookin at me like a fiend

Disparage every aspect of yo
All these other hats
They're just words
 Stockpiles are hella expensive
Most of them , our watches are gold
We in the house like my homeboy

When I pull up with a big Fat John inside
Drop the priceg | Cut the buzzer
Leaving you with big tears
Impressed with my new tyres
You wont tonna wack

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Waiting in the wings
Waiting in the wingsDrip drip drip drip
Drop bleed drip drip
Disaster!
 trigger pull trigger pull
Pull up in that mans receipt
What a shame
I didn't ask for your help 
Show me lane external x 
peanut butter and jelly
Poppin rims peeling
hot dog compartments
Break up like my life depends
I need a life preserver

body bags full of fuel (ooh)

body bags full of silicone (yay)
Litas a bag so I cans pour (yay)

Clean as a report clip

Clean harsher than a dinner receipt

Clean calisthenics like a full-time job

Drip drip drip drip
Drop cup so that she crashes the boat
Live a lie like Khepri Mao 

My many cups of coffee could melt you
But you know that by my side

Every day im out here spraying

Money, hate, and gloom
What a mess
All these various debt destroyers
All these other sexual assaults I'll just sit here and waffle

Don't need a LIke
