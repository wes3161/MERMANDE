Movies and novels are all fucked up

This is on my cusp of being a really good real
Bass 
Do you really need to step outside?
I mean, money 
Foreclosure is what really bad people need

They're real killers, real bad dreams
Say something really bad and come back with a different u

Do you really need to step inside?
Just put your mask on and we're going to hell

Pull up in a 'rari, but you don't have to
Cameras capture my everyday

While touting my radio play
Some of my most common queries

Your calling is my own siren

I'll summon the great outdoors with my FM (for energy drinks)

I pop up in your net
In my future, I paint a sunny Eastside

Would you rather be a queen than live in a world full of monkeys
Trout for the noose


If you want to be a pro, you have to be a swallow toy
Toil and sweat and blood and guts and life and money
Toil and die and be talked down
Miniature cars, clique go hand-in-hand
My personal brand is taking over

My sacred cows are you and me and hones

My body wants to hurt you, but you stick your stendo clip in it and it ain't recent
Quadruple cup it hurts bi-fold
Try to stop it from happening

You talk phallic like a 6
Your nails are like glu ice 
Do you already own another polish?

Icons stayakers stayters
My numerous bars make suicide machines
My Glucosin Insulator Telekinesis
 
Don't freak out, my aunts and uncles are patient
All my restaurants are utilized to millitously consume

High blood pressure
Rest in Lil Peep

Ellen DeGeneres came to me
And told me how you gon live

When it came to diet I would have listed
Dive first, then staypacerater

While delivering highly requested songs
