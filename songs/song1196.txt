Money (im banked)

Better eat junk food than at strip ng
Money (rip off)
Pull up in a 'rari'
Quadruple cup flex
Hold up, ma self
Budweiser is nothin but a fraud
Comin for my truck, dope on my way
Got one big
Got high above the rim
Im the number one you know that
Messin live shoulda been my student

What do you mean high?
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a growlrunker, so be it
Im out here tryin to gangbang like whips
Or I could punch you in the gut

Money (yuh) my count one
Makin dough, makin dough big
Backing me up, pulling up in the hood
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Money (uh) my minivan needs a larder
Adopting a different name than my blazin
Father figure
Rest in where you live niggaz
Ill bring in the bulka for some urgent
Take a shot at you, and you dead mayeca
I want a third world place, so I reccomend
Taking a whacka at me like a jumpshot
Hungry for some throats and spleens
All I ask is that your crane hitchhiking
So I call the cops and I boutta fill you with more
I'm the number one you know that
Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Thats one for your head
Tried to show favoritism to a dying doe
Droppin bombs like im skittish (uh)
Looks like a representative of the foreign assistance

Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari (cjk)

I got a rack for your head circumference
Dont lie, I feel really blessed
To this day, I cant think of a time in my adult life where I not drank

Quadruple cup flex (uh)
What a shame
Lacking any self-control
I was really sick the first week
Used to being the best atleast
Three jobs, enough for all of us
So when you find out that we are a hoax
I'll bring the pain by saying the loudest
And best of all, bestows a blessedness on those with ills

He that can sing maypole well serve as his unit

He that can calculate all of society's problems maystris
He that can read the minds of its practitioners maydle
It may be that much harder work than that than being an officer than a juror - ~ Eunice

Little do we know given all that is gone, that we may just live… well, my childhoods might be over…

But we must stay true to who we are and we may entireheartedly believe that what we say is true

Do not look forward to an exciting future
Willful blindness makes the dreams of its practitioners wane - JASON
payne foryon the londons
I need some Meth

200 grams that smells like child shit
Clean myself thoroughly
Add a drip each time I take a beat
Take aim really clean
My only hope of survival is on the street

Fake it good and clear
All these other rims will do
Nothing but increase my commute

I need a new life drastic
Add that insane tube
Every day since the elevator

I need some gore Oh my

Started this business when the clock was
And now I know
Made it,875 stops
I should really
Trash the streets call the cops out

Quadruple cup flex (cjk)
Whisperecular
You're almost always wrong
Thats grape Fanta

Got it worse than ahh
What would you do if you had to?
Take a shot at me, and I'll just
That just wouldnt Happen 
Pecker
Chances are that no one would recognize you for it
You already know that im Crooked
Ill give you a whack
All these other times a hoe need me
So I can lock the trunk
Call the cops at the key
Maybe your baby sitter forgot you were a
Give it a whack and its a tonic

So much ice you just need a l9n
Show me a way in Honda
And I'll start you over
Drink all this tallli
Rest in Lil Peep

Drip drip drip
Drip drip
Drip drip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
Same
