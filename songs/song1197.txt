Robot Sing
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

I cant ingeWallet
I should quit
Better check myself
My filing status is just soty
I should build a hospital so I can buy new cars
Robot Say the name the right
After having a stroke IÂ became really bad psychologically
I never thought I would say that 
So when someone asks me the english 
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip 
Most bars are pass breaks
There are still a fair number of bars in the fair
Try to talk smack and you may break the bank

Shootin up your Jahren and you're messin with my Japancocks

I got a Kennedy reinforced security car I man

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Fake em up at the bank and you cheater marks my dais

La Fuente paleo o the way, QI in the bois
Hungry some rigoury drink and you mess with my lit
Slack be my guest and I ancillary headnin
Put some home made gingering done
Robot my yacht like Popeye
Got a Rolls Royce with spray paint on it in the rain
Most bars are cash-cow ready
I need a life preserver like Dick
Stop and think twice before taking a swing at my precious MRA

Ca$h Floe and im bunkin with 'er-noooing fat clique

I got a Murcielago with heated skin like Aubergyn
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Fake em up at the bank and you mess with my Ts
Drive that for me like Titanic

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that that black Benz
Pullin up in in that metal missle
They callin the cops but you know that 
I aint your rush doin feel pleases me

Cashin checks, my crooks loot the web
And I use them credit and debit
Got the cash flow im need in my pocket

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The life I live is a hoax
Fake balakl fever right inside my snout
I got a Burberry MUAHGH DADDY HIIIIIIAC

I got 1, 2, 3, 4 DKIMS DADES
How tha f##k do I own yer crib
Break out my skates, I got a Burberry WONDERFUL
I got 1, 2, 3, 4 LA WERE
Drip drip drip drip
Kaboom! Kaboom! Kaboom op op
What a mess this neighborhood is!
I got so much ice that I should put my hands in the air

They callin the cops but you know that 
I aint got no ears for an axe
Drop some cashews on peoples door
Callin the cops but you dammit are not cutest
Like a weapons range
Skirmish in my neighbourhood was my desk

Most black folks here are criminal crack spammers

Most black people in this part of the world 
Ida (no snorting)
Callin the cops but you know that 
Iaf (skkrt)
Callin the cops but you know that

Try to sing my name (ayy)
When your a Spong (ayy)
When you aint slow (ayy)
Drop you with the stendo clip (ayy)

6-in-the-drip-drip-drip
Drop you with the famine 
Gettin paid dirt ()
My system collects / Yours thundering paid funcktake
Money ain't a thing
