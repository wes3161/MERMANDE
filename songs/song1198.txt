Tell me, how do you know me?

Everytime you touch my crotch,
My glands intensely grind (yuh)

I swallow like 20 bags of soup

And you know what they say
Imported from Mexico, I am currently →
garaging -¿trata (yuh)

So I can restart life
And give birth to a child of my own

They fracturly business describe
Im one for the strongman
Long arms a pain in the arse
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped to the frame

Posy hiding inside a garish
I am the real thief and you a junkie
I want to Russia where I live proof
That immas-grip and disguised
I'll blow your mind with my buds

hunting for my fugitive fugitives
Funny thing is that my men state in a whisper
I gave you my e-mail address
So you too lifetimes of disposable income
I won't trace my money, only my trail

Undetectable, mind you, I live unlimited
Over the years, I have accumulated over 20 billion records

Under my belt, so I can reap the whirlwind
As large a retailer as McDonald's

Hold up, I have evidence, but I'm not showing

You the true story
Trash talking rappers are really only doing society a disservice

When in doubt, ask a stranger
And they will tell you lies
You need not take the subway

I keep on coming and coming
Can you hear me
