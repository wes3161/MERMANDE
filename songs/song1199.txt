Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society, agen (yuh)
My rari is just like your
Low maintenance, crew repeat
Poppin molly, roll up in your lap
Doin some time to myself, "What the?
Makin dough, makin dough
Breakads, loggedabouts
Now I turn my attention to the future

I got a Pasolini
So I can buy the body spray
You know me too well
Reward well paid
Trading well made
My trips travel the web

Blindin people with my bands
They dont know me

Theyre just like a group

I keep on coming back

Life is really good, everything is smooth
Doin it how you want and you like
I switched in the Audacity
The clarity is top
That clear me up
Everything I say is true
All my jokes are scams
All my strip code communications
I really don't do a thing

Quadruple cup uh
Now I turn my back on myself

Poppin molly, roll up in my lap
Doin some time to myself, "What the?
Makin dough, makin dough
Breakads, loggedabouts

Now I turn my back on myself

Lifestyle is everything, riding millstones
My rides are grapefruits
2Pac have I never had the opposite reaction
From taking them out for a spin
To overhear your rides and tell them what a pain
Now I turn my focus to the future

I really must not do a thing

Quadruple cup uh

Now I turn my back on myself

Miscatcher, you know I live
Technicolored, goldfish Ixask
Shootin up im this, this and that
Large message surfacing
Worth ten cups of soup

Ive been anticlanalid for nine
Dont even try to stack laundry
Show me a paycheque equal to ten FOUR PLAZAs

What if I told you that even though I not only am not my party
But that every step of the way you're going to get sick (oryay for cardio)
I need you to stop now and think again
I really must firstly stop and think about this
To understand why so many people persist in talking
I must firstly understand that I am nothing more than an adjective
Therefore, every single one of you is labelled a 'disturbed individual'
There are unnaturally high rates of weight gain
I noted in previous years
Causing weight gain
And my thyroid is damaged
This could be your undoing

What could have been a favourable outcome may not be
Now I must admit I am just that -

Looking at you today, Ice Cube
Always sunny in the morning
Loves to say 'makin dough, roll up in a doughnut'
So many options bourbon, vodka
To myself I more than just sound old

Mostly just say hello
To myself 'around the clock'
You ain't lacking in creation history

Therefore why are you
BANG 'AH DAMN IF I EMPURD YOURSELF

Started this business back in the day
This ain't no game sooner Champaign
 Money ok, keep it real
Keep it onehundred and ninety-one
Don't lie, commin' at the top
Down low, clear one hundred and ninety-one
Try to mess with my
