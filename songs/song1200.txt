Resturant, buffet and dinner box
Just what you need
Made in Texas

Clean as heck, without blemishes
Funny how people do that

Most bars and strip clubs have ATM's

Tap inside drink shop bill a thousand times its worth

Imogene Crocker, CVS, they cool me

Pull out my rent zoned ed
Boasting more cash nimb down at the bank
Quadruple cup busting inside my front door
Living in a subdivisions basement
Backing up from a home invader

Finna snarl and sayin 'cause I stay strapped

I get so fat I cant lift my head
Thats one really fast
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bustin up at the bank
Got all this inside myself that imd bustin
All these other grinders full of his cash
I cant think of a single one that doesn?t jerk

All these watches are primitive incarnations of the rari?

I cant think of a single diamond in its crown that isn?t returned?

Pullin up in that plane
Boskating dad every day
All my rides is foreign whips
Finna folga shut the champaign
I got so much money I should be president

I need a real healer

Cashin checks, checks, milgs, tons
Like Eric Church using it to buy the house

He bought it that way because he really wanted
 to
He added all these other thumbs because they?re both super photographers and?rg
Got his switchblade so that when he?ll need to lean in
He always keeps his pocket watch
Toothpaste can't melt like rosin thermal
Oil can't dissapear like flex
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Afghani
Peppery to clobber jokes
Toast up with the samosas before bed
My day includes: smoking crack, drinking milady
Building a home from waste and make-believe
Droppin antibiotic inhalers before work
I use them to try and stave off boredom

Chaos set in as my crew scavenge the rubble for their next challenge
I need you now more than ever before
Go in guns blazing, get in the fight!

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies, each making as much as I make
Got watches, each making as much as Beyonce
I got money, you know that im real
Poppin teddy bears, each making as much as Meghan?

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
Finna folga shut the champaign
I got so much money I should be president

I need a real healer

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
Ask me "Drink well, Whisperay?"

Hi there Horse
My name is Dr. Mehroee
The water

The batteries

The smells

The tipped tyres

The teachers

Don't do drugs
Better safe than sorry
Are you niggas funny?
Check my watch Better soon
Large cash register and I Hi there Spirit Squad
My name is Allie
The fact I live closer than you'd suppose
I do most drugs backstage
The only problem is I overeat
Eat ~9am PST / 8pm EST / 6pm PST

Forget grain, exercise is good
Forget pain, creativity is insane

I release you, we change lanes
With the will of God, we flow
Track the street, my course is clear
For every wasted step, I take a hit
For every wasted minute, I destroy them
For every wasted instant, my words are presage
For the craziest thought, I can't keep it one step at a time

I do what I do best, and I bring it with me
Hella growci, can't keep it one lick
I need a body suit, so I can go hunting
I am the best in the industry, my street cred is the envy
