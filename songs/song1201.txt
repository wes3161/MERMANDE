Monday through Friday I clean out the house
Clean it, slide it in the trash

Keep it onehuny

Don't do drugs
 Alcohol is the single best prescription drug

I cant even wrap my head around the thought
To myself
 Walls can only mean bad law
Lawful murder, you ask who
I bar squat
Keep it onehuny

Don't do drugs
 Alcohol is the single best prescription drug

I cant even wrap my head around the thought

To myself
 Walls can only mean bad law

Only a fool would take these words as fact
That being that not a single juror would take these words as fact

Fake trappers walk the walk, the there are still so many we will never catch
Help yourself be less skeptical
When confronted with the truth, you are the best
Break through the bars of fear and you will be met with swift but firm results

You are the best, the name of Islam
Shall not be invented, and may God have mercy on its thinkers
Imminent doom awaits us all
As my prophets have said, "Will not win a war…"

As Jesus' words hold true, 'Thy castle not high,' he will surely set it on fire
Tell that girl not say ____ at camp…
