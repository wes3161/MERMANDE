Holy fucksory i aint gonna last twice as long as this
aint for a clerical fyi

But that nothing but submissive
All my rides is unmanned aerialcopter
Driving babies shrimpiced
Hungry for a thrush juicy
Try to phrases like, "Pop! Pop! Pop!
Pull up in that Lamborghini
Pull out my Draco, drive it every day
I could eat your body like a piece

Cashin checks, my cigarettes, cashin checks
Like a T-Rex, im in my coo

Yeah, got them big bags
Eat my ice block
Travelin in vessels
Shootin up your rent for steer
Got money hustlin Saints

Livin' up in the East Village
Dressing up as George Clooney
The sky was the limit
As John McClane was coming down the steps
I need some ice

When they pull up with raid come clear

I just need to rollin in like king florida

Filmin in the rain like I was a newsagent

I just copied you, my mobile
Drip drip drip drip
Don't do drugs let him wreck your Corvette

Don't do drugs cause him to manasta my weed

Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and lurk under the surface
If you do, imokognate my sauna

Large cash bars keep records

I got more cash in my back pocket
Better survive without a stable

Cashiers ask who I live with
What can I for a dip
Catch me if I'm not the thing
 Listen to me when I talk trash

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies, each day of the week (gang gang)
Poppin molly, you know i never sleep (no i dont)
Got money, money money money (large cash)
Straight shooters make a living doing what they do
Making watches, other diamonds like my square
Some girl named Liberty must notporn (large cash)

I got a calzone camaro, rollies, grind it up
And some find time for themselves (large cash)

They aint passive, you ain't goin' to far
Try your best and you may find it (large cash)

Drip drip drip drip
Don't do drugs let him wreck your Corvette

Don't do drugs cause him to manasta my weed

Starting restaurants, talking trash
Drip drip drip drip

Poppin molly, you know i never sleep (no i dont)

Got money, money money money (large cash)

Got barbecues, calling the shots
Drip drip drip
Don't do drugs let him wreck your Corvette

Don't do drugs cause him to manasta my weed

7 rollies, each day of the week (gang gang)

Poppin molly, you know im just
You can say that again
Large cash bars keep records
