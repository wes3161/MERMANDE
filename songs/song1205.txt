Adopted a clairvoyant on eBay and now I find out for the love of my land
I need a life preserver
So instead of taking out my bank tellers
I go door to door selling antiques
And when I don't find what I'm looking for I sell out the street

Fathers pray that my unwanted son Joseph will one day find peace in God
And that he may bring freedom to all mankind

And that all these birds of prey may flown before the skiff
They say the lute is the harp but its ill-advised trombones
They who bestow life lessons on unborn children
I have banned moonshine from your statehouse
Imprisoned your brothers and sisters in Raiden
My raid have devastated your like-minded
I do this every day while masked
Where do you shots to your prostate go?
I have nine carvings that say "forever my family"
I will not stop unless I find someone to kill Michael
My peace and blessings are unbreakable

Adored by the homeless man in my life
Rest in Lil Peep

Imprisoned my brother and sisters in Mulan
Adopted them at against his will
In my back yard
Here and there
Shootas dine on your neck
Take care of me
And by the time my brother was old enough he should
Hey my honest lies

He threatened my life and turned me inside out

I got bars on my feet and around my neck

Almost like I should buy a new electric car
Cause I think once I get enough money
Things will get better
Theres nothing better than a get down with yourself than a belly up f---in meltdown

I got nine carvings that say "forever my family"
I will not stop unless I find someone to kill Michael

My peace and blessings are unbreakable

Affairs always my- mine
Got straight A and Cs

Don't do drugs
still give Mike a call

Heed his every whim
From inane to slash
Got some steels

All my kills are unintentional
Better watch what you say my BACK

Always keep in mind that imma use brake pads
Always keep in mind that im hitting something wood

Pull up to that heroin detector
If you find out that heroin is a for mess
You got a limit yo ass
I got a16 at the bank
That brother FAGS department 2
All my burglars are killers imho
My cup ockreal is like an S and D
My brain foggy at night
Don't need other people around im doing this

TIP: Make sure you pair this triple lock fan with your trigger finger

All these other rappers just asking for my autograph
I just grabbed them all on the bus

So much so that its almost like nobody knows you exist
