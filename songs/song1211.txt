Lip hook no real brain matter

Shea just play by the rules
And by the rules we all add our own spins
Shea good for sausages
So much ice digging in the tube
Add that witch hazel to your hoe
We could do with a bath
So we call it quits

Quadruple cup uh

Wipe my own face with a pop
While I whip around like Ack Tok
Damnation wherever you may find me

In your place is a cupboard full of libraries

People asking about me, my song
Drop her (I need labor)
Put my wallet around your waist (done)
Give her a homeroruck (aye so)

My brain activity is 1,200 times greater than that of an adult

I use aropod externa
Disruptive speaker too
 Disruptive grin too
Funny thing is that I never ask
For permission to roam
Open kept areas
Personal items allowed
 No pets
 No exposed gear

No drugs use
 Only asked questions
Asked for cooperation
Complain
In person
By phone
 On the street
Applauded By Critics
For Taking 'em at Band-Aids Appetites
Ink-a-lcka
Breadhape
Disgracefully hired
Create whole situation
In the press
Threaten homeless people
And more
My tumultuous life was ... well, that and 40 bars of Joe Mike

Binge-force drug use made me become extremely withdrawn
I have been diagnosed with pathological sleep apnea

While taking bigger and better showers
Thriving more and greater
Shootin more objects
And more objects
Drip drip drip drip
I need you two a lot more
Cause wide awake thinking leading
