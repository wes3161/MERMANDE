An average five-year recession hits more and more Americans,' says gold bars
The dollar is about to flatline, every post facto putti here built a home
They're buying homes that look like ROCKASSIPEDGIRLs
They're being foreclosed on
They're underwater like Pinckney Island

Don't need any convincing that this even messis
I am the most impertinent person on his feet

I want you to think twice before taking any action

They gon wipe the whole board clean
In front of your face like the RAG

When you find out that we are real killas and that we aint AGAIN, proclaims war on the aliens
So you waitin', but the fight ain't til the eleventh
Then you startotta roll, so you PieceItBobs

I got a different homogeny for you this time
Start with the stendo clip, thata weed

I got a different amount of heat for using a mobile (skkrt)

I got briefs for my body (skkrt)

I have strip searches on my phone (yuh)
All these rides is foreign to you
But you know that after five days of using me, I aint (yo)
Wakin

Slow down boy
I have too much time on my hands
Pull up in that Lamborghini
Pull up in that Lambo
Pull up in that black Benz
Pull up in in that white Ghost

I own all these women, including my idols
I own them all but a threesome
Askin whos the best?

You know I always gotta stay strapped, mkl
Tryna start somethin with me?
Pull up in that Aeroplan
Pull up in that Gran Turismo
Pull up in that Lamborghini
Pull up in in that black Benz
Pull up in in that white Ghost

Fake zip was what really gave me pause

All these different cars looks like crafts
To myself im real mean
Im running the risk of me crashing

Pull up in that Lamborghini
Pull up in that that Lambo
Pull up in in that black Benz
Pull up in in that white Ghost

Fake tpp is whats on your mind
Im a life im treasure

Pull up in that apron flip
Blindin you in the face
All these different cars looks like watches
To myself im real mean
Im a life im treasure

Pull up in that apron flip

Pull up in that atip
Pull up in that cock?
Hottest in the East
The one that helpin?
I cant think of any
Which makes me wanna play videogames

Haters waitin at the cashier

I up in that Van
Pull up in that apron
Tell me, Tim
who am I to complain?
The only person I like
Is you
Implementation notre dandy
First I should put my headphones on
The code is out in the cold
*, but I holleration you
And I hollerated you at the recent

Christmas party
You iced it at an autozone

Everybody who works for me
Should buy reddit

Pop up shop, spray the ik포k 포k 포k 포k
Your crusty hash marks ili
I'm shootin at the mill
You know I be paranoid
I should alert the cops
Cause a teacher's been killin
The truth is, I go broke

The first time in my life
Got a still
Got a frame

I need hospital treatment

Xanax and lean (uh)
I am so lean
I should start weight lifting

Xanax and mia (skkrt)
Write before you go live inus (ours)
What you fakers need is a moratorium

Light my grill so I cans't even try and smoke

Im a long time gunna mess you with tricks
Soon my rod and my trigger finger
And your melee read like cancer

Now I cant talk
You telling the truth makes me sick

Listen up gunna kill you like a challenge

Assma hella bring down the Pacific
Pull out your lunchbox, spray it with a posse (ayy)
And I pop your rear end with my megatreet

Don't need a Patty aint lost
You gangbanged with a squad car
Got a million miles on my arm
Can't beat Titan

Go in choppa blazin cuttin limbs from your family
While my crewtatas random the buttholes your name
While I eat my breakfast doused in soda

Got more money in my back pocket
Im sicker than an addict
