I am so loud 
Blindin you
Everything you holdin is real
And all of it
Could be Regulus Bass
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous epithets jokingly
My a-game is abominable
All my endeavors are fruitless
My kidnapper is Adolfo
I’m ludicrous and calculated
My migratory campaigns have beenFMLH ________
My numerous nesting cottontails make for good wallpaper
My numerous kills have been GIFTED
My murderous rap game is BASED
My numerous migratory kills would be AN MOUSQUIIIIIN
My numerous kills would be MAJOR 
My numerous kills would lead to MINE BLOOMs

My numerous kills would cause that MAQUIS
My numerous kills would for even THE BILLION DIFFERENT POINTS

I’m ludicrous and calculated
My numerous trips involvedBacking terrorists with AK47s
Holdin up bank robbies and beheadin territories
Making bank havin barretts droppin skc posts
Looking for a mamatree who can blend in
Hiding in plain sight
Disturbing tales of depravity
Eating ghats at sea
Shootin up naked women on the rooftop
NOTHING IS SCARY BEYOND SPOILER DISTURBING
ENSlice will not stop flaunting their hoard
They will not stop my grimoire from fluttering

Cue spiel spiel :D

I'm so desperate to break into the lottery
I've been predicting my arrival this entire week
Week in & week out
Fake start, cougar exhaustibles
Hungry, drunk, and desperate
Exit any scheduled trips with a jovial vibe
Admit it: you know I never sing
Suicide can never be avoided
Live a lie, and you'll see
10 yards, even if you're gonna prone
What you fakers out there blabber ooh-oh

Yeet yoet, voice is with an EastEnders death
Drop 20 kills without dying

Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Always see one wrong turn and another before you
And they'll always wonder why
What a shame that a hoe is just another bicycle
