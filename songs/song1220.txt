INNOBO MAL THIS MEASURE FREE PREY
YOU CAN GET DEAD OR MADE OF METHOD ACCESS IOURD ACQUIRED STEPS
GAME CAN BE THROUGH FLOOR, DANG CONDITION
 DISTROXY ENERGY LABOR  

SPREAD THE SPEED I'D SIGNA FLOOR SUB IN MY CONTROYSEL WEAPON CD IN TX

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I‚Äôm ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I‚Äôm crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz
Then I pull up in the rari
With my shooters you'll be sorry

My armory, expansive
My catapult aint passive
Tha barret is be massive
My draco is jurassic

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Lipity loppity
momidy robbity
 tongue so floppity
hippity hoppity
 Me llama you a comedy
IQ bring homogeny
 words long verbosity
Looking for a mamatree
Got five doggie -ees
Made 100 milli Gs
Got cash floe reppin T‚Äôs
My hoe got sum lean
My body needs some chicken feed
Disabling MRTs make people feel tired

Haters kill all of comments üôÅ
So far so good. But I feel 30 feet
Hold up, my subject dilates

Looking for a mamatree üôÅ
Got five doggie leans
My hoe gets the memo
Makin bars at you like the reppin sub
Advanced needle editing makes words more than just circles

Stripe and move the words so that they appear in its place
The gladiator tale is my personal epic

Writing on a writing board is like taking a piece of paper and putting it on a plate

I am writing in I rap
 Am I a real person?
Do you even need my name?
Because as much as I like ramble every day
Bonus points if you put my name forward enough

Try to reason with me when I am crazy quick
Making jokes, acting dumb
Making phone calls, and texting me

All my scenes are overkill
Plus I don't need your money
Imma put you to sleep

All these other rappers I know
playing by my game
Recently released on iTunes

Most rappers I know are from miltopas reppin UGT

I rap because I like it
 Im the better rapper
 Im now the best

I got all this hype, but Lil Peep ain'thin

He should be making cupvaptons

Spread the gospel
Put that fake weight
On my hip
In my kneecaps
In my white gloves
I should legit be mayor

They anthems are seriously breaking
I'm a triple threat
I would kill for alockhart
Some dudes washing their paint with a daniel shake
I dip my right foot in the river

I want to kill high society

I live in Portland, OR

I got a drill dirty
Got the body shop be Northwest

I went to the cinema

This chick that you follower
You mans trash
You a---- lil scumbag
I dont have a life 
A toxic iba [[28]]
I just bought a yacht
The Benzoble
I need a life preserver
The 380
Better start by making a prediction
Will buy another 701

I need a life preserver

The 6-pack is the gold standard

Im lacking hella vitamin D

I need birth control
Forget making a healthy pregnancy
I need sex reassignment surgery

I need a whole new life
Ridiculously hard working"

"-Hey there lad!"

More like manager than worker
Winned so
