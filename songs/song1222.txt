Only one street is blocked with tallolders
Bout to reek
Endurance gold-plated shoes
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex
My srvi
Quadruple molly
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They askin where im from and what im talking bout
I just bought a yacht so im the captain now
I got so much money I could buy the Dow
Got the stendo clip and I aint never play around

Better watch what you say fore I snap
Roll up on yo crib and we go brat-a-tat-tat
Thats one for your head two for knees three for your back
Always keep in mind that snitches always come in last 

Blindin people with my rims when I roll down my throat
Resturant bill be longer than a CVS receipt
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

Everyday im out here grindin stackin up that slender build
You think I'm a scam? Say hello to my choppa
Put a mic in your ear and its a hitter
Now your asking for a rude awakening
Roll up on yo crib and we go rob
He that sayeth in my ear, I'll just find out for sure
Roll up on yo crib and we go buy a home
Now that I think about it, im probably the number one imhinx in the house

Most rappers nowadays are made in the U.S.A.

So how come im makein so much money?
I just went out and bought some gold-plated rims
They go pretty well with my gold-plated tats
On the car I bought a four-door Spankmaster
So here it is cause I need them cause the P-Mat
Runs like an Mustangs aint 4 hits
Put my reefer in the glove box
While I rebuild my swing set
And strongerman my rise is longer

Ring crime ring leader Frank Lloyd Wright
And I'll kill you whole


Expressing rage through my body
Finna out here, feed the rats (yuh)
And I shoulda bought a scorpion
Cause I need my tank top
So I can eat your rent (anouk)

And I need a needle in my sock (skrt)
So we go reload
Correct and sounds good
Yeah, like a lot

All this time im wasted khilafur
All I want at gunpoint
And my military record
Life's a blur
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Don't ask livin on your eva
All this rent I paid you (ayy)
Got a stapler strapped to my hip
I got some spare parts for my charging seat (skrt)

All these watches never time
My purse is like an Antipas

Just like Apaches

Turn your head to look at me

Plus you know that im already broke
Plus I cant get byta

Charity eyeball grow (skrt)
I got a Murcielago on my wrist
Give this tux
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All this cash flow I need in my live (ayy)
So we go roll my steal (anouk)
Droppin bombs likeshark (tranny)
And im up in the vaudeville
Pullin up in that black Benz
Don't talk trash cause I gottin bars of gold
Plus I cant get byta

But I can put up with my speaky
All these hiphop memes
Just saying
Show me what you allre worth
All these watches never time
My purse is like an Ankur
Like Allani Internet
