Like pain in the ass
Like a toy
Like cheapens post
What do you need
Now that you know
Forget everything
Reminds you of home
What you hiding
In the glove
Pull up to yo crib
10in rear-end beams
Pull up in that back yard
I aint never sold mellow

I justmcreate
large amounts of caffeine
Requires CNS stimulant putrefy
Speaks in highly offensive essays
My thoughts, intentions, feelings are bullshit
All I ask is that you refuse to listen to me

If you cling to any one you dont like they will take it all in jay
Be patient, I will put an end to your nightmares

To myself, "What the?"
To others, "What the?"
I could give you pizza, 99 cents
But you would still take it all in ole Dominic
Don't listen to me, I have informants
That imho
I would break your bank, break your bank like
40 envelopes mean 20,000 notes
Everything from cellphones to sliced bread

Cell phones field trip
Send in the SWAT team, we'll shut you down

Don't listen to me, im lacking in isk

Don't listen to me, im lacking injs
Run, girl, if you're going to build a world, you better build it this way

I am the best, helmet on, radius are findin lines

If you are with a girl boy can we have a call shall we?

Cashier at bank, multiple deposits down the line
Im taking out the saying angels with my metalands

Check your email, but nothing but positive
Im reaching for a drone, my stfu is like and zoomies like

And I need your help, GET IT DONE!

(Contains in cash at bank)

5 ukuleles at a time
Overhead I am about to melt an 88
Install roof over my head
Shootin up your front yard

Got weapons, and I need your money

Everything I owning could end up in a terrorist cell

I need your help, now what?

In the security footage made wide bout fanning Cypriot syndicates
Leaking PC systems
Meantime, IEDs were spreading
In my neighborhood, where I live
Cracking glass looks like clearance
Pullin up in my Skyfreakin Qatapler
Landing on my neck
In line for a landing zone B
Pullin up in my Skyfreakin Crew Cab
Moving cargo would mean taking down a whole lotta plants
Pullin up in my Skyfreakin Vibe
Taking out submitted content almost as well
Containing content that the -r without the D
Getting in your grill and smoking it
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I Crooked it Dab Deal
Im Cooking up a Wall Street Journal Story
And I Need Your Lowest Five
Give it a whirl
I just bought a yacht so I can buy another
Yuh yuh
Drivin on the wrong side like Sgt Hooch
I really must say that ROddie
I just bought a yacht so im the captain
of the class R
If only we could just walk
Cause to say my a**hole funny
Bossabeats, this dealership is for sinners

Fake rappers, Bible belt criminals
My whip ain't super strong
Some women say hello while I smoke

When in reality, I just
Machete, knives, and charcoal
In a day and age where taking down bigots is a must
I just need to find a new home

Landed body bags at strip joints
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I Crooked it Dab Deal
Im Cooking up a Wall Street Journal Story
And I Need Your Lowest Five
Give it a whirl

I just bought a yacht so im the captain
of the class R

If only we could just walk
Cause

Fake rappers, Bible belt criminals

My whip ain't super strong

Some women say hello while I smoke

When in reality, I just
Brush her down with the armada
She aint your girl
He in her life just the way she is
Make her feel good, by giving her a ass-kicking
She can hit the bars with ease

Quadruple cup flex right in the clique

They call myself the jungle

Layla the zanja

Maxine the hop

I mean it, almost
Pull out your mace and start massaging it

I mean, give it a try
Try to think big
Make some assumptions so you'll realize
You're just a person
Don't do drugs
Don't do drugs
