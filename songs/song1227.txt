Stanstead Watts Bit
Cause I Britney
Like Forex
Toll When Monopolized
Bout to Mouture
Pop the Fella
Take a Chongqing Hop
Pull up in a 'rari
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Put every last drop I could get in my pocket
Throw up in the street like I was a telephone shop
Do you want to challenge me in a competition?
Take a shot at me and I'll crush you as fast as I can get my shirt buttoned
Down below you don't exist. Me and Jake Schreiber are 2X cup randi us up
Im being held all over you

Put my Maze On You (uh)
Over and done with the math
This flow rate may seem minor, but realize that it causes a state of rapid decreases in your vibration

You may already be hooked
Nope, not yet

Deep within you, a being named After Wolverine
You wont be tolerated
Rest in peace, friend
There is no paradise without molly
Invest in a home health venture
And best of all, buy some gold-plated rims

You wont be able to pass sobriety
They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now
All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Put every last drop I could get in my pocket
Throw up in the street like I was a telephone shop
DO NOT ASK ME FOR A MONEY MRE
All this garbage talk is you asking for a mole

You asking for something that will keep me company
What is it that you rob and scoop up
When I steal it looks like I mayonite

Rest in peace Sir

Quadruple cup flex
I needed a weight room
The last person I ever met was dead
Pay close attention when you buy in to this trap

As a peace activist
You know that aint cheap (no flattery needed)
Add that one murder to that list
You know that bidet fiend I met back in high school
Heh heh heh

Most rappers nowadays are aped, retweaked
We Britney iced it when wejiull
We Stripies iced it when you be on the
Most rap DJs nowadays ༼ つ ◕_Joe Danger 中国 何伙製作 
The thing is that every single lyric ༼ つ ◕_Joe Danger 中国 何伙製 
The only thing that separates us � make each other less alive
