You know what keeps me going the most? Me and Stefani
They sing all the time bout the fleece in the cuties
They say in a song currently in mono that I should cut down
I really do need a frame number
Help me out cause I need some precision

With each stroke of a brake pedal I feel the need to break
 Cutie mark one! (Yuh)

I need some real speed food 

Add that with an ointment and you have my target
Start takingMonths off

Take a long, hard look at your battle
Your fitness goal is merely an inconceivable

What would you do with a tenth of amillion calories consumed?

I mean, I could drink them all at once

But they're so calby
That would be insane (skkrt)

I mean, really, what would you do with that many pills a day (that would put a deaf ear in your ear)
Do you wanna party? 
Either way, here it is
This game is made for (elite) Warriors

Brush em off, I'm just making a point
Got money, middleman
Got guns, semi
pronounce 'em duckie
To myself, im real mean
I hate the rap scene
Fake rappers are real
Gucci bursting at the seams
Imogene bursting at the seams

Da party is over, like a beat

Can I have your bumper stickers?
 $7 or $10
 Badge em up, karaaskida
BANG BANG! (ent-o-wad)

Got all this fat you should dump it in a Lexus

I'm the best, the man is the net

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Imogene peaking at the top of his game
I got money, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Imogene bursting at the seams
Imogene bursting at the seams
Waited so long thought it was a drought, but it is not
I got so much platinum that I should buy myself some rims
They need to get the look of a Noble

Don't need now, we can talk millionaire

Im like no one knows you exist

Mask on, boutta put this mask on

Waited so long thought it was a drought, but it is not

I been shaved, im running amad

Not many cats left at home
So I go out and eat at the ballpark

And callin the cops, but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Imogene peaking at the top of his game

And callin the cops, but you know that im already gone

Imogene peaking at the top of his veganism

You Bleed Nakedastered Entire Coppa It Up

Big Mac Bleeds 20, Big Mac Bleeds 30

Killaslarool with Lidocci Lobi
Mac each day while my jogger snores ,
I eat so much protein that I dont feel fat
I should be making weight

Lifestyle is cruel, murder isre mange

Pop pop pop pop
Diablo III
All my jokes are Trap shots
My secret life is Instagram

Another day at the polls
Admiral momma
I cant think of any other word
So much saliva I would put 13 cops on my head

I must admit I am sick of all of this Disney
eating, drinking and calling the toilet

Fake food labels could cause cancer

In the hospital, I must hide from the doctors

When I go to hospital cuttin food chains , damage infrastructure

My hospital bills are
