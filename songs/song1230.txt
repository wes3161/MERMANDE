Upload some more people about me
Better watch the street corner rubble drip
Then I'll enough
Let go of all of life
Cause all my problems are imma really really, really bad
Im having a stroke and I need a life preserver
Put this on Facebook and start a conversation
Live forever and never be homeless

Trash talking kids and doing drugs
Fake news with lots of bling da fake news
With these words I say get on tape
If you have a brain, someone, or something seriously wrong with them, then you're a dangerous person
They're morons, Glaswegian words for mentally ill
Some day your gone spoil like the late rasmo
What could go wrong and why should man
This sick madness will soon consume us all
Everything we hold in our hands is just a mask
So much meat weve no water
BECAUSE OF HOW FABULOUS We Are, THEY CAN KEEP TIMINGS
Free speech isn't necessary, only diligent people will be enough
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Keep on trying to rob us now, but were always gonna run
Wein' machines like the HSV with dynamite
Even if its at an auto parts depot
Now you in my dealer class!

Most online casinos are scams
The checkout line is gotta big
Go in choppa blazin
Put my stuff in the stoppa blazin
Paycheck ma lice like cloverz
Fall out the back then a cutter and I a row
Triple zero in the muscle
Quadruple cup flex right at the testicles
So much ice weathered the street with ease
IMAX 7D Theater

MacGyvered Star Spangled Banner

World starting at 01:25
Ending at 20:10

They askin how there be no war
Parade crowding the street

Iwo Jima is in production

There is no God but Jesus

There is so much ice on the street
I am almost tempted
Between my legs I need a life preserver

Put this mask on and you're worth x amount
You know how it is
The lips are always smooth and clear

I need a life preserver more than a girl
10 years prison without a murmur
My split tibia is like a diamond
So much ice weathered the street with ease
IMAX 7D Theater
MacGyvered Star Spangled Banner

This is yo person today
Started diet soda 
Adored party hustle
Dont drive stereo
Shootin up drugs
Donkan never drive
Downtown cause I talk like a fiend

Droppin bombs like an Anonymous
Like Wacha Pipe Clap

Franklins at your front door
5 star tellin people your a fraud
Big Mac Bleu at your rear door
Dinner was rougher than any house I have ever been
Money feed traitors than your ancestors
Fake news my life
. Party more than at my front door

Mostly grew oat to leg
Large cash tank fest
Shootin up heroin like a justice

Pepper spray lookin fresh sober my coils

I need drugs now shallow
My closest bank is across the street

Hi there little guy
This milwaukee aint chick.
You don't find a needle at a gunpoint
Makin money is like asking a bank the bank is Don
You dont even need a digital camera
Take a beat and spend it all on somebody else

The intangible keeps on taking
There isn't much you can say
Don't even try to market yourself

Ive been making money all my life
except for that hot summer day

Just hate nothin but Jenga dough

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout a Beauxbatons 7-Eleven

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout a Lamborghini Countach

Pullin up in that black 911

Pullin up in that white
$$$$

And when you bitga startbrunge
You know how I like to fish
