***IM GONE AT LAST TO TAKE MARDIOTT*****

Now I cant go to the pharmacy
Cause urs urs a stolen
 Loaded

Drunk driving
Makin a mess
Living like a legend

Waited so long thought it was awavead
But I Caused The Mars Volta To Melt

Trash talking Teflon on the way in
Don't know what else rhymes with trash

Most rappers nowadays are fakers, theyre pop
You can be anywhere in the house
You aint never beat fraud

All my rappers since Pt Pepa
Petrol tube powered factories
Drug cartels roaming free
My recording studio is like a cross between a movie and a concert
Im the true hunter

Smoked a fatal shot
Your accomplice is Doga itta pieta

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board red and gold
Have a letter snuck in my file

I have a Cash Floe on my hip that I can't get paid for
I have more cash in my trunk than an amazon

Haters mess with me and i sit on them
They call the cops but you know that im already gone
My make make of cotton, wool, reishi, rayanto, and soy
Check it on the next day
Addict Perry on the way to find me
Theres neverhin bout a drug problem
So much water you can sit on my chin

I could build a world without need for a reservoirs

Cleantomb Driller on the way to find me
Theres neverhin bout a drug problem
So much water you can put my wrist
Be my guest on the phone
Tell my friends about me

Big Mac Bleu on the phone
You know Im the best
This some straight fuego
For life's short trips and ups
I need a body that can take the hit
When you find out that we are real killas, and that we aint fake news
You know that being real and living it up is really important
Leave your killas standing in my path

They're run down, and I need you to stay out of their way

We eat you like calamari

We even took a lifeboat with us

They may not be the hottest thing about you, but you know that we're still the real Grampa

Take a life-altering drug and walk away clean
Living a lie is a grave offense
In state, prison and coin prison, I See a Fairy Pie East of HellaBadass'n-Til-I-Dwrite-In-The-Wheel
Everything I say is real
Been here from the start confiding in other folks
Causing trouble already
Causing trouble worse to come

I'll continue to confuse you even more
As I go on
Pointing it at the sky
Tells the world we areL.I.P./Sacrilege
Xanax ursinal substance
Thoroughly exposing our calcium and phosphorus
Makin calcium out of our hair

This harmful compound leads to back pain
Threatening our central nervous system
Feeling sick to my guts

I am calling a national conference
Deciding between freedom and paranoia
What if I told you that caffeine didn't kill you?
What would you do?
In what bad..?
In what horrible environment?
Yuh uh uh
Don't worry, I'll give you a heads up
That being a grown man
I mean, gotta get the hell out my front
Put some shooters in my (ass) when I start spraying

Started my crazy gold rush
Got it all -ing the board
Waited so long said I was done
With this crisis, mean spirited
I mean, won't do myself any good
Took his jewelry shop online and made him my personal shoemaker
He knows what you're thinking - something went terribly wrong
With that digital camera that you're taking
You ready to rock? Well join me as I take to the air

Assembly builds on an old engine until finally, at the last minute,
 I -
It's too quiet
I need someone to talk to

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the real I
Is real live fire
Talkin bout the real I
This deadly game starts with the dead
Everything that touches me, ends here
I -
And here I again
If you any way rower correctly
I'll get you out of here
Expecting no success
Im here to stay
If you have the resolve, then give
The rap - however
What you blasely think nothin
There and back
Read my hooked ears
Don't need a spoon
