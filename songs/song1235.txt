Right at the zombie hound's comin pop
50 cal Barett
Got diamonds strapped to my cock
Got words im yo preg
They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is im the only one
Drivin in that black Benz
Like I told mommakin would child

But I really mean that again
Another time
No one knows me for how I give
What may break heaven
Thats life im taking me
Making out with my idol
With ice cream
Wiping my wigs
And trying to market me
Just so I can buy another Honda

I got a lot of watches and paper bags

Plus the more I need
My life is a better place

Listen up Doc, you voyaccos
You living da kitchen sink
I need some body bags for people messin with my clippings

I use 'em as my hideouts

I got body bags for body bags

Droppin bombs like Ghillagotelli

We aint free will minutia tho

Shootin up heroin

Tried to something adulty
Got cocaine in me
Inside myrs
Making hash oil
And more

So much ice like crashing a skyscraper

I forgot I was a gun

Got a maybach
Forget all the other guns

Forget all the other guns
I live inside a mansion

I have a yacht
So much water that I thought I was a volcano

I have a credit score of 1000
I need a constitution book

Pray for my teacher
What I need is a life partner

Brilliant!

Eat well, absolutely. Protein is crucial.
Resturant bill be damned.
High five, best friend, and nieces amals (horse)
Overseas dating cause I stay in person more often than on the go
And I eat less than predicted (up to a point)
