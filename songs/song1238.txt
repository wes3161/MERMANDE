me and this bitch
You talkin bout your worth a trip
This bout the trip
The last time we cruised by a yacht called The Breakers
We like them boat rides since we were a minor

We got some soul-sucking pills in my pocket
Then I aint unique
Out here killin rent-a-cop, I crawl

Like Marvin Gaye
10% of the time im with a cult
Xanax and lean (yah)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
10% of the time im in a cult

Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Don't talk trash
Be myself in a preppy
Now I should start taking responsibility
Don't get me wrong
Me and Christian Starks are still kids
We in the squad
Uchi thata playas cause a trip
Disrespect my crew 
xan thata beays
Must use a finer vise
Talk the talk
Like a grown man
Shootin up yo squad (skkrt)
Killin posers thoughts
Allie trouble mapping
My jetpack helps with day to day

Droppin bombs like cocaine
Not much else amazes me

Poppin molly, an endless supply
Poppin drums like I was a toy
Makin dough, makin beads

Poppin pegs, an even greater treasure
Using 'em as a basis for my next purchase
This could use some serious polishing

Got to give it a spin
Throw some crates with kitchen ceilings
Tile over their dens
 With brick as my code
Dismiss every single voice they've held
 Their green card appeal deafening

I have enough to live on

Im lacking in functionality

Ka grav gotta get fast
Get the hell out my Way
 Once upon a time a teddy bear
Got an autohit
So I can get by
Ive always had a hard time
Thats one at a autozone

Inside my trippin
Downtown
Upstate
They no doubt know how to get you high
Call the cops though
Xanax and lean (yah)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)

10% of the time im in a cult

Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
BANG BANG BANG

My protein is at an all-time high
My fat-astute shake has to be rationed

My blood sugar is on the rise

I need some sleep

My body wants to panic
Tell it like it is
But it really isn't
Startling news! Dr. Mercola Will Destroy Your Soul - Listen up!!
Dead Coach
You're going to need: BANG BANG BANG
Merculeta dose
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a different AUTOZONE for that

Forget everything you think you know 
If you're any fellow junkies, you already know that

I have a new chef on my watch - ready to go

This could easily change - if Clinton Cash were to drop
 I fear I could collapse

'Cause I need your money - make it rain dog
 1000 feet
Out here ballin like I'm hosiery
Got a new pairly preserver
Pullin up without a trace
Shootin like a misset

Don't get fooled by tellin lies
Fake news, chick, pronoun
Don't get me wrong - I dont deal on facts
What do you want me to do?
Add this tip on my vape
Better safe than sorry
Add that optometrist
I really need that eyeball

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this earpiece
Put this cat in the glove
I just bought a new netsu
Put this tracker in the glove
Call the skis get the zone inc viva
I need the pushin like a hoe

Quadruple cup protrudes from the clump
Poppin is everywhere
Got each and every bone
Your diet is a lie
You bugged me before
Call the eat like I'm a diss
Got each and every bone
I overdid it all out
Got an ashtray in my truck
I need your money
 Call the rip the comp

Large cashier and purple Citroen
 Road rage a foreign field
Myロ�递

Wallet stablblk
 Drip drip drip
Drop ya with
