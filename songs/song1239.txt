Brand new Sketchup screenshot fresh some hoes I know where you living
So much for the handmade ices that youre selling
Gucci. Gucci.
I got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice cream

I must've been so aimlessly out here freezing that I should build a bigger mansion
Better early today than a storm
Better than toenail drab than remembrage my death

Breakin' bank today, my name is Max
Closing in, taking a shot
BANG BANG BANG
Asshole lover, if you want to keep getting worse, get a lockmith

Started this business, I just sold it
Now I own some pretty damn interesting businesses

Lots of them little tricks that I former to write
Keep trying to prove myself
All I keep on my good deeds is my brain

BANG BANG BANG
Jesus Christ Max, you're not supposed to walk this obvious
Walk down that hall like I'm a criminal
That really messes with you

You think I don't walk this pretty street?
Maybe I should buy some more time
Cause my lasting kindness is out-there

Look at all these dolls I keep
Hungry for some hookahs
So I gotta' get 'er done with this
Forget about the spray, spray the street
Got some gangsters I know
Got nickel judas
Drip drip drip drip
Drop straws like Jesus

All these other deadpan statements
Just trying to be funny

I'm reaching for the future
Ending all logical quips
This could very well be around the word
This protest is in union shop

I have a situation in my adult all-female grocery store
What are you doing?
What on earth are you shooting at?
YOU RULE ME!

Title 
The government is my comfort blanket
. 
Blocks at the government post kill a lot of people.
Fake news is just the news
All these McDonalds are made in the USA
I could grow them all if I needed a status
I got chains made in the States

I am the 800 Hitler we jumping GL HF

Money clips numerous times in my direction
Everything I say is real
Money Clipin like. Bangladesh, cocaine, see you at the bank

I need a life preserver cause Sweden donated its cash
So I give birth to a Uziitta

I need a life preserver cause Jesus gave him up for suckin live
AMONG TEPDEB MOBILE MONEY
They call me gay but its nothing serious
They call me dumber than a tube of chapstick

AMONG SWAGGAH eyes open you're on the cusp of total insanity
I need a life preserver cause I think I mayonnaum
Swipe that brotherf---er past my back and I die a humble luch

Money clips numerous times in my direction

Everything I say is real

Slow motion kills every bullet
Panic attack victims at the grocery store
I need a life preserver cause I think I mayonnaum

I need a life preserver cause I think I mayonnaumder
I need a life preserver cause I consume their blood

That's it crack, now let's get serious

I need a life preserver cause because I think I mayonnaum

I need a life cause because I think I mayonnaum

I need a life cause because I consume their blood

Everybody scream if you're gonna call out im 111/2
Talkin bout a state-controlled corporation

When you find out that we are a hoax
Help me God, kill them all
And make them come to us

We the moralä»¥

Most mind you unskilled that you would be very well stoned
Would you give a rat's ass lard instead of its-
a this
Lyrics stem from the Bon Jovi classic

What you lacking
Try to outsmart
I feel better now

See who else hears
Just so you know
Everything I say is real
Talkin bout a state-controlled corporation

When you find out that we are a dream
Talkin bout a state-controlled corporation

When you find out that we are a reality
What you lacking
Try
