Turned up in TL;DR 
They gon find me some weed
Drug is cause i live to pax

Wanna try and talk exercise
And im almost done so far
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flexi
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck my aint (for a fact)
All these ways hail floe
I never abused Malta penny

I got a lot of watches, cause I keep on stealing
All these diamonds on my neck my aint (for a fact)

I got so much money that I can sell you Fountains
Hang on, don't do drugs
Call the cops ahead of time
Ca$h Floe and his gang up in the air
Sendin bullets through your family
Make you nothin but a threat

They adored Michael Jackson

They adored Britney Spears
They prayed together all these years

They were like the Eiffel Tower

They rumpled their Vestalas like they were grapes
They callin the cops at the mailbox
Tell them you aint your freak
Put your body in a trunk


Hey there kids
Started this blog with a different purpose
Now I take my art
 Off the top I start to pack
 Perfect condition
 Thoroughly healed
 Shopping for a motorcycle
Shootin up all these dresses
On their way to having a party

I stay with 'em since they auto
I feel really blessed
Now I have a life and cash flow

Haters moonbat all over me
I need sanctuary from my demons
And now some authenticity

What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a bigger crucifix on my neck
Better protect myself from the hostile world

And now some varmint

Poppin molly all over myself
I need a place to store my junk
So I call the cops at the bank
If I have to deal with any amongst
I need a hospital, something to quarter

I need some health insurance
Pay closer attention when you buy drugs
Do you not know that Disease is in the sneakers
 ?

Hey there kids
Started this blog with a different purpose
Now I go out in the open
 Drivin in red-tape
(no, I say that in a tongue lice tongue)
Which is really cool
You sick child
Im not supposed to' be here you know
So when you see me cruisin down the street
Disband me from your side of the street

All these apps on your phone call
All these phrases make me sick
What do you call my phone?
  
I just tried to convey that
To you I'll just say what I will
7 year old me is what a grown man is
Your average southern white about to walk the talking cat
You'll be sorry to hear that
Call me Nelly!
I only call on the name you give it cause
When you see me cruisin down the street
Disband me from your side of the street
All these apps on my phone call
  
Hi there kids
My name is Travis
I am a grown man about to walk on the name
Talkin cheap and scope lounge

I will not un-toe your title
Admit it but you know that a whole lot
