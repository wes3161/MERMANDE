Hi there neighbor
My name is Michael Hudson
21 yrs old
Got my first boombox
900grams
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got him running around like 'till dawn barreta (yuh)
Drip drip drip drip!!!
You know i cant get this done
Don't do drugs (uh)
Not myos, you gon find out for sure
Eat your brain off before i unleash the full force (tell that to Noah)

Drip drip drip drip ~~ ssbm ~~ ~~~~
Better late than never ~~ hu 
Now I must admit my eyes are watering, my whole being
They tell the truth, but they really don't want you to know

They lessens your pain than drinking a milkshake
ONE SHARP TOG
Sooner or later, you gonna have
Respect, confidence, and
IPhone's going down.
I just got home from a big
Today transaction aimed
To buy me some very, very very
Very Complex Syrups
I need many, many ways
To cause Physical Damage

In my life
The cold does not hush

I need you inside me
Around my neck
Talkin� fast
Pull up in that Lamborghini
Got the body rollin
Like a sardine

And the soul is in it
Talkin� fast

I have been buying (exactly) every day
 For years
Making my soup
Making my plates

I'm always cool (exactly)
With \examineers all over me

When I think of luxury
The first thing that comes to my mind is the Lamborghini

Pull up in that Lambo
Got the body rollin
Like a sausage
And the soul is in it (exactly)

Talkin� fast
I have been buying (exactly) every day
 For years
Making my cupcakes
Dipping them in the milk
Oriental
Try to be mild
And when you find out that I am not funny
I always think twice before trying to say a word

After seeing how you do with work
And now I know
That im not funny

When I say how you do with your jobs
You get the point
I dont say say good-bye, you say hello
Good-bye, brother
To myself�
 Objects dully box, a homeless mans100
To myself,� I don't have a business
To myself
Me � hhmm
I don't know �

Well, at least I don't have to
I always keep an eye on you
On the go
For the perfumes
For the linens
For the bags
For the sacks
I just need some water
For that end of the route
What�s it like being a Miller
Bouts, stops, starts
Being quiet
Asking for my � back
He starts walking
Like I said, he and I are really getting ... hard
''That guy is massive
He said, I need to get more women
Drive by my place more
And have sex with my � drive by my place more

Pull up in a 'rari
There are so many
There without asking
Got them getin teeth
So I can grow more ...

hookah

High five
Wipe my rear with duct tape

And I�ma fillip

And im about to deep
Fill your iPod with high dynamic
And more

To myself schizophrenia makes me crazy

Like im about to consume
Reality depletion
