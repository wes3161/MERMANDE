Everybody think rappers are girly? I like their tummies full
I got flames in my cup like some kind of mod
I've been selling cocaine in my home state since 1987

I grew up in the 'hood, so when I saw them skate
I got ready to roll
Choppa, eat eat crowbars

I got cocaine and pills like poppys
Im lacking the strength to lift a fist
I need a life preserver

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
All this wage processing
All this prison comin
All my dirty little misadventures
All my infantilize words
Talkin bout mincing uticks
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades whips
I got so much ice skunk that I should buy myself some ice skates

I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

Messin with me many flights of stairs
I need some body bags for back comps
Add this to that Dickinson One Drip Your Jealousy
I need some body bags for my rent arrears
I need some body bags for my rent arrears
Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
All this wage processing
All this prison comin
All my dirty little misadventures
All my infantilize words
Talkin bout the living nightmare
Pay no mind to my rap partner Dr Dre
They askin where im at?

I needed a distraction from reliving my teen years
when in the feu doppe I was

Everybody live in luxury
Pruâ„¢tize us with their Uzi

When I want to wash my dishes I go on a go-kart

I even got a one-hundred dollar purse where I
Ded up my rent money
Got a lifesize camera

I need a life preserver

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
In the palm of your hand
Threaten to your gut, you say?
everything you say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
In your lane you ain'thin but a worm

I held up a sign until we 'fellas started taking photos

Haters dead like luther work myself to sleep

Pop 'r at you once
a remains of the dead trace their roots to this
a forgotten history
all these other rappers have stardom
their stardom has been exceptionally short
I take to heart the many virtues that each and every one of us exhibits
I bring these characteristics to bear in my lyrics
I choose words that evoke nostalgia
all my life I would have been unimaginative
Nowadays I take poetry as a skill
training my playas to be more like artists
their innate rhyming ability blends wit with death
every verb conveys a meaning
a meaning that can never be re-chained
I consume highly synthetic drugs to relieve muscle weakness
having trouble creating distinctions
enjoying facial expressions
seeing through sentences unreadable
speaking poorly of myself leads to why other people slack
compared to me
I consume highly psychological to combat deficits
seeking relationships that strike fear in the soul
finding rewards in talking trash

finding love in the form of bad food

eating junk food can really make you sick

having a sexual relationship with a 39-year-old woman
before coming to realize that having sex takes forever

My body wants you dead but I don't want it in my bones

I give up and find another life
a better existence

"What a sad day cell phone call!"
I have been documenting my journey on my iPhone

When I came across your blog you may have observed
I finally found someone worthy to speak my mind

To myself and to the world
Just a thought

I must say that as someone who is dedicated to truth, my words are clear
I continue to bring you this list of my best known words
In no particular order: "...ryz", "mata murre", amonquivocally
I highly recommit myself to excellence and consistency
the only job I ever wanted was a web developer
a true artist
