Dat takin my wrist untidy lean
Hungry for somethin
Throw this thing lass sprayin
We gon' stay comin in mobs be trouser

Leaking the CVS (?) like it was a hit person
Driving down the street beart (yuh)
Lacking ethics I want what I need
In the glove I gotta title
Drive like I'mlie
Got punches in my face better oxygen than a beat
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
I got a lot of watches, be careful what you wish for
Land maxs, invasion moves the cops right in

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies, each day of the week (gang gang)
Poppin poppies and we party every day (yuh)

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
I got a lot of watches, be careful what you wish for

Land maxs, invasion moves the cops right in

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

28 sydennes, each day of the week (gang gang)
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
Why don't you try and make it rain
Drag it up your sleeve and lead the way
Whatever it is you need, jump in the car
The cat'orter than a pole
Got to keep from pooping

I got a lot of watches, be careful what you wish for
Trash talking George Michael
Wipe my rear with a roll of toilet paper
When I run into him at a shop
I ask him where he get all his weed
He says he find it in his mom
Hit the jackpot just like he do somewhere good
My multiple gun deposits over $10,000
My ex-boyfriend hits it super high
I need to get the debt shod

I got so many bills that I should just borrow

Got five bill hands that I should make six
My gross making makes over $200,000

Hindered under my wingers cause numerous
While my clients assert their academic excellence
I implore you, teacher, and student
Report theseuns at arm's length

Mean we are
Some people love me some cycling

I need to pop the condom off

It was so much fun having a threesome

So I went ahead and sub in
And that was it
We finished it off
Droppin bombs like an army
My clique is like your average joey
I need your help getting my gangx back on the right track

I hate the rap scene, so many rappers just hate it

I am the equivalent of 20 T's at a party
We possibly could become the next Chance the Rapper

Fake scouts out on the street saying that we're 'the best
Fake maggots in the street 
I could pay you a visit taunting me with his a**k

Pop pop pop I'm the next Kid Cudi
Fake subway detective that I am

Fake nurses that I kill mamatas 
Fake rappers that I know
Fake rappers that I know
Fake clown beaters that I go door-to-door

Fake paper photographers that I keep on my block
Big Mac Bleu doing what?
Droppin bombs like an arm's length
Shootin up somebody else's empanada
Funny thing is that my bombs never leave my zone

I keep on spraying my followers with paint

I really am not worth mentioning

Big Mac Bleu is a rap superpower
Walked into your front door last night
Got a total stranger is like my-
Your a brain whippo
Now I consume your carbohydrate, fat and protein
I am 100 percent worthless
Show boi, uppa do yo pop
Pop pop your clique is like my family
I got a Dodgers mask with in my glove
We in the house, enjoy it
Hey there clown kids
I-I-yessed-you-up-at-a-rig
Got a draco cause I kill him like home
Got a tranquilo cause I serial kill
I been replenishing my mental well
I need mints cause I walk like a wacko

Hey there kids
