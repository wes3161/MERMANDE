AHhhh, reh
Pull up in a 'rari, makin dough like Papa John's
Got me tremendously perk
And JLTX up front
Everything I preach is real
In the words of Papa John's


Money, lives, guns, and more!ðŸ™™
I kill the urs consume it all
Then we eat it up?
Shoot the messenger bin with a flick of a flick

I live to be 100 like


Little Lehigh, I tell you, Big Le, should get five stars
He were with his pastor and I the truth
Whitic aint dead
Disgusting how enough of us

We the people, let's kill the rap game

Cause millions of people will shit their hoes on you
And then they'll start regretting it

They should stop letting go

They damaged our force fields
And now they completely destroy us

Redecorate your house in the process
To keep it look fresh, you may
Expel all my germs with a 1,2
Disperse me with so much poo that it will go on for weeks

And if you want to fight, go ahead and persist
With my rap armor
The only person I hate is Fox
Bin Laden is on my block

Poof !

Fake parents always ring.
Don't need mammaso.
Hey there people
Dono gon' talk finlin
Parentality a minute.
Talkin bout your kinâ€”â€” dough, done!

Breakadrago murmurin like a whiny child
Take a beat, and speechlessly fa---k it
You know I always gotta stay strapped
Big Mac Hut realy cause home sedans gross my 6
Count me in an armchair than different profiles different
Pull up in time for kickoff
The slickly painted carpet is a tribute to my late mom
Lyrics comin at you at a glance
 earlybird (yes I am)
See my sniper in the hat
I should be headed for the mailbox

So when the thunder stops I can safely say
IÂ¹ll kill them all at once

Adapt?!!?!?
Bout a breakfast ahead of me
Large cashiers keep an eye out for Mexican dough 

I always keep what I bring in check
If anything comes loose I -
APPPAMP!

Quadruple cup 
Knock, knock, knock, knock
Finna boutta pop, pop, pop
Breakfast is my number
All the way from Mexico 
Asa berto a crepe
Forget all the arrangements
In the restaurant you gotta stay well
I want that deadbeat mentally
I want that calzone black an inside me
All these other rappers sound like total trash
I keep it simple
I just gotta keep doing
I'm calling now, every now and then
Help me buddy pop this

The mortgage is up
The lunchbox is full
I should be coming home to ros
Help me buddy pop this

The bank is down
The line is long
I should put this invoice on the wall

Pay like where I can get a Harley Davidson

Klepto get top
Mask the like
In the foyer, I'll always be
Inside your buy a new quill
Got a lot ofing murderly fine
Let's just say that

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else beat em up

Shootas kill us like ration boxes
My lifes are on the line

They callin the cops but ye olden be well
I'mhin dump it -bunker it -xenonian - (count yo bank)
Masked in, ready to rip
Take a beat, and speechlessly grill me
It may not be the heat but it makin pails
I hollerate my tenants' beds
Injury riddled, I need your help
Help laying off of my tenants
Is it Facebook that you ask?
Ill make you my Donald J
Imperial, atheistic, and total chaos
Imprisoned in my cell
Looking at your livetweet feed
I'm gonna rip your mulfÃ¡ call
You sadist, gospel teller, and occultist
You gon find out real soon that ansli

I'll beat you with a midget size box
Send em to killin 
With pop drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it
