They (Juicy J)esty lotuses keep all things consumer goods looking like mere peanuts
That whole '90s strip really makes somethin
Put some women in strip clubs
And they hanging out at strip clubs
You know we socialize a lot
And we all end up in the news

More women are reaching for money
And women are buying me more sex

I just don't pay attention

Everything I say is true
And so I really have to
Tell myself to think clearly
For someone as simple as me,
I always say `yes.�
