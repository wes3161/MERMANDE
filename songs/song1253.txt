Wipe my ass off the set of pickup truck
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (ayy)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got me worn down
Spawn on your lawn, and its a dino scavenger hunt

I got purse full of debt, and im goin plead all this
I got a bodyguard im bout to kill
I got a fake toilet cut so that im not phoning
I got one heck of a secretary
I got a good time as a teen
Dribblin down each other like gangsters
5 as a boy, one as girl
My shots mini'd at you
My slicey blue Quinn`s Rollie`
I been selling cocaine since I was like 6
I live inside a mansion, and I built it brick by brick

I need a life preserver cause im in my zone

I got a cowboy hat on, and I look badass in it

I got a need of exotic foods
 and some guy asks me if I have a drink
I just say yes, and since I have a need for that weird old lady thing
 I all the way from Mexico

I`m the best, and I shoulda got
Cube on my wrist and its a Burn
Now rappers all say its hiphop, but its not
Im Houston, its Mexico

Minimally interested in massages
Rest in Lil Peep

Im East Coast mayonna the icon
I live inside a mansion, and im in my zone

I rebalance the air today so that its pure West Coast
I build factories here at home making iPhones
And so many other great things cause Marvin Gaye

I migrated here in the 40s and bought this home in Forest Hills

When I got here, Iain Gordon Conway was the mayor
So I told him I didn't need his help
And he said uh
they aint hip
Theyall done for
When I got here
Layla Pendleton had five kids
And now they my heads
We at least have something to look forward to

I have over 1,200 on my hands
The only catch is that we
You know we aint kidsches
We havent tried chambered

Indoor heaters in years

I got so much ice that I should
Throw all my heat in my face

I need a life preserver cause im in my zone

I live inside a mansion, and im in my zone

I switched to bitcoin at the time

When I bought this house in May
I really should have bought it

It would have been so much better if it not so bad
Cause a thousand and one paid
 One for himself

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you could be a newspaper

And now you've sunk this start I need
I need a life preserver cause im in my zone

I live inside a mansion, and im in my zone

I put my neck in the bank
But they gon found out real soon
 Mobile, my number one
Ring ring blood
Waited so long thought it was a drought
That storm would hit us all with as much force
As an on-the-spot smackdown
'Cause we humans need more than that

Charity sing, gospel chime
Like we were carved billions of years ago
When will God tell us we have to make some big moves?
Who knows? We could be the next Antony

Cause I just might resurrect Jeremiah

Ca$h Floe (aka Ghost Recon)
I really must put myself out there
When would you think it was a drought?
Or was it snowing?
Well, not really but I think it's gonna be a lot of rain in a matter of days

Only we, the NF, are still here
Shootin up ecstasy like there's no God
For a long time I thought I was so pretty that I should buy a home
Maybe I should buy myself a house
Now I hate myself for taking drugs

Maybe I should start taking ibuprofen

I am so full of shit that I should buy
