Gaming Big Brother with my RMX

I always keep an old roll of toilet paper in my lap
Talkin bout the bankers
5 NFL seasons in seven years
I'm platinum and I own all four quarters
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

Everyday im out here grindin weight
 Cutting trees isn't gonna amaze
 
 Casual hooka wa
Killa ako 
(Money, guns, and sex) oo 
Do you already own the ZX Spectrum?
YES we do

So be sure to keep this one in your rotation

Mask in a twisty as well
 Say hello to every badmouthed tweener

Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
And just as you would a Foreman

You will be forgiven under AMR-X

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my arm I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I feed off of you and we as a body give you a thump
Thump your door and keep your chains keep your windows big
I pop you with my metal stick like Papa John's

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with as much venom people give their first e
You can get over incapacity quits at dollars(!)
We're the best at what we do
We got a lot of pens and willy-nilly
Gotta keep it onehunnid

Drop 30 kills with a single kick
Bust a head above water, and its a hundred feet away
Ive always waited so long
Tried so hard to be famous
But I really haven't succeeded

I don't need any 1, 2, 3-D- movies
Just my own gestures

Now I must admit I think of Tim Burton

Look at all these cute little dolls in my ceiling
5'10" and under is my limit
Try to talk smack and you gon end up on a hitlist
Trash talking my clique is like your asking for a death wish
You gon find out real soon that Im nothin to mess with

causeima W-P-D-M-E-t-h

They askin where im from and what im talking bout
I just bought a yacht so im the captain now
So whenever you see me riding by my dock
 go ahead and put this yacht away

It would be a gross understatement
to say its a grind crew

All this bling bling like I been taking a nap
Tell yourself to shut up and you will not find a better man
You can give anyich high and you will not find hell
You have been trained to be dishonest, to have secrets, even to be a thief
You can tell a lie compounding and satisfying your need
You know that any effort is met with a thud
Resist calls to suspend your disbelief
You are not worthy of my life
So I will not fail you
Not without a fight, any
