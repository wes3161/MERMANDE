Beware the deliverers hidden throughout Chinatown

Fake betrayals, mask for lack of a better term
Fake withdrawals, finally making it back into the bank

Quadruple cup cash, buy chevc
Grab a wallet and cash in, using my shield
Step inside my remodeled house

Bought a nice new car

What a shame

Better start saving now and again

Only a fool would do that

Funny how that works

Don't need no Miniaries
Throw them in the dish
When you find out that they really are bananas
Just like you
