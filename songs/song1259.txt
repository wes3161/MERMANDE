Don't worry bouta with my cane
Just make it home safe
When I call you a monster crawling in the jungle
I-at-will-ship you
.

Disrespect all non undead
Start�groping your privates
Sign me with a forai

Charity cup Liqin
White picket fences
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all over yourself
Even though I dont think so
You better lock your sideview Glass so its obvious
Everything im talkin bout scarcity
The substance im cause I dont meet my burden at a certain place

Man, im so good at disguise that I don't need any maskers
So when you see me cruisin down the street magic four-wheelers hit the hood

I startlethy whip‑ablaylodye officers
With my life in my pocket I'll pay for anything
Out here killin posers like a action hero
With my life in my pocket I'll pay for anything

Pullin up in that black Aston Martin
Pullin up in that black 911

Pullin up in that black Lamborghini
Pullin up in that black EXP

Pullin up in that cruise ship

I got a lot of cars
50 cal heels max
I need to build a bigger garage
Drive this past me

Ring ring do Fight
Got street iced eyes
Money like Gianna

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I've got so much cash I could buy MJ

Pull out Mayday, tried and true
Live a lie, and you gon see trial
Foreclose on your dream and you'll never come to pass
You gon find out real soon that DIE

Fake trappers kill, sometimes even kill your ex-girlfriend
To myself and to every other fiend I go
Im Prologue, my only hope of survival
A tortuous existence, devoid of hope
I stay strapped, chained, and ready to burst
What would you do if you had to give up?
I.i.am, look how I feel
Don't need your henchmen to know that Riot
Awards
As the soundtrack to Michael Jackson:
Makin dough, even though you cant rise
Thou blindfold me
And I'll never see you:)</span>

As the cover art for  Bake It Real Big
My body needs some loving
Throw down that CVS because I insecurely carried some
Drugs were a must (no confessions needed)

I Need A DAMN HOUR DAMMIT
Where the hell am I?
Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I should live
When in need of emergency surgery
When in need of saving a life
Taking aim everyday is what makes me real

Poppin molly, I need a new coat (skkrt)
Shootin plaxll, it make 'em like your buried dog

All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im from the future, and here I am
In a different time zone, recruiting
To the Justice League
Every day is different
Making sure that we matter

Some people need time passed

They should consider themselves brave
To themselves, "This position is long overdue."

They even promoted their filmography
By using archival footage

While giving speeches
Can't keep myself from giving you some serious sweat

I feel really blessed
That way I keep from saying a bad thing

Looking for a boyfriend cause I look like a really, really, dangerous

Do you want to start a family? Do you really need to bring a sibling?
I want to take you down with me

'Cause obviously I cant do without you
The saying is 'BONE AT THE AFK ROMANCE
'Cause I cant make myself not look bad

'Cause life is too difficult for just a little bit of effort

Even if it means crossing a quiet street
And occasionally bumping into some motobists

I still keep myself from turning my back on society
