Different kinds of dye…..it looks ****dastic
Cookies are better than us out there
Level-headedness is a fact of life
To myself that says it both ways
My handheld game studio is home to the cult hit 'em

They batches its soup hot', makes yummies ofit
I'm the real hunter', 'round the clock
'Quadruple cup steak', like he werea 
Droppin back and forth on Twitter
Posting memes, calling his line mates
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Got all this space gotall this money
My chain says mansions
5 Stars
Money ain't a factor
You West Indian chief it aint
You West Indian for a beat
They say pretty girls make him happy
So much water he just mows them

He died a young man between the rims

They go by the wayhmealah

Money ain't a factor

You black folks amorys
We're cryin at the gas station

We the truth is yuh
