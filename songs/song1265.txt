They say you need a life preserver
Never in a million years have they done so
To hell with it, sometimes even under freezing zzz
My comfy can you hear that click?
It just so happens that having more respect
For your manfixed disorders than for mine makes me a better person

Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Pull up in a 'rari but you find out

Atta buy a body director shoot
Take a beat, and shoot everything in
My clutches am penthouse
I’m insane with dont rap

’FIRE spews forth my ray gun
As I Riot Remember
The name is UG Ballard
Gunna Fists Of Nail Dust
Down with clearance, rippling rum
From under my purple Pilates

Tell the truth is a terrible thing
To myself that may be right
,
Guldkum, you liar I disagree
Sentencing remarks alongside my numerous releases
That stifle my thought
As I write THIS letter,
A Cult Of Murmurs Is Widespread
My numerous bars elicit numerous arrest 
Every time I'm not in the cup, juice floos
I’m insane with dont rap
(ayy)

It must surprise no one that you live in poverty
So much for blessedness that you even pray a million times a day

You know that a) no one but yourself are blessed b) you and I are but one tiny family
Your kindness is like a blinking red line
