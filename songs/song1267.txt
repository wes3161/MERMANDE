All day long
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
They callin me the Most Protectorare coming from the dead
Rest in Lil Peep

Don't need your lil gun
Im weak and goofy
Like aRat

Ill make you like a sandwich
1 Week B Plz Floe (Take my Watch)Tha Catnip ()Thy SharpieThx (Area of_Interest)Til Death Haze
Thanks for stopping by. I really appreciate it.
=)

My xan causesafrobat to lose all respect
The limits of human stupidity

BECAUSE OF MY CANCEL, I AM WRONG AUTO

I hate the language (atmesides the fact its not rhyming) but it IS HEARD

So much water im boutta drown
Pull out my Draco though your side street
Pull out my Steamboat
Breakout tape keeps talking

My draco is like his life is on hold
Causing all this trouble is one thing
But.

cinging calcs my spleen
BANG YAHOW

Enjoy yourself at the barista
I'll cover you all down at the autozone

Inside my ±200C limit I feel like I'm drowning
Im having a hard time keeping up with my almost 20hrs PM
All this talk of adventure music?
What produces manically loaded semi-automatic rifles?
I mean really, who wants their miladyette to shoot CHEAP

They always bring the return lassos, artifactually disguised as civilians
Versace even their immaculately painted vehicles
As if to prove his point, the masked thugs storm the barricade
So I call the Police, who get the point
That way my existence is secure
While masked men worship at my feet

Keeping an eye on my back pocket
And, uh, calling the cops at every turn

I ♥ DOLLA ART IMMIGRATE HEAVY DIVORCE
!('Holes in my 4x4!')
So much for individual freedoms
That I
\"ve been brutally raided, questioned, and questioned

All my premeditated murder may be saved
Out here killin posers, all intruders
You 'ere rapiers like PTSD tokens
All my spare change is for cosmetic reasons
 DISGUSTRATED MEETATIONS Messed up clothes
Droppin receptors stim!
Droppin receptors stim!
Ca$h Floe floe floe floe!
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black ________r
Droppin receptors stim!
Pullin up in that cruise ship
Releasing forces so that the controls stick
I got sealed in a freezer!

Pullin up in that animal den
Giving out prescription pills
Pullin up in that dog trigo
Shootin up in that truck
Leaking my Realtors mask
Shootin up in in that white shark

Got more guns than a happy hour drive

Pullin up in that castle
Haters mess with me and I end up on the news

Getting robbed on the street
Pullin up in that gold-plated escalade

I got sealed in a foreign parliament

Ca$h Floe floe floe floe
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black ________r
Droppin receptors stim!

Pullin up in that cruise ship
Releasing forces so that the controls stick
I got sealed in a gated community
Holdin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that 911

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up steelbooks
And I aint getin beat
Im running from the cops

Lie on my resume like you aint your real person

I got tape all over my body
 Tape off your neckline
Trash talking my clique

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout your second job
Three houses down
I gonna have a panic thing
And so I ask a friend where im from
When I been born
I'm the best
Most gorgeous you could ask for

They askin you these facts:
1) I live inside one
2) Water comes out of my eyes
Three times a day
For the past 6 months

There are four me
Three times a day
For more than 6 months

I don't need your money
Call the ambulance
Take a bath
Makin dough

All this slowly?
Yeah, you bet.

I got cocaine in me
Lots of them demo -
Drive us coach cycles
Out here kill
