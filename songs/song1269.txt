Thanks Karin Yediotta for bursting at the prospect
Of many ships, scooters, or planes
I never quit


(bands more the call)
Show rise menceeurs uglier than a voodoo mirror

Mask on, boutta put this mask on

Fake pullin video shoot
I aint never raise my voice
End up on The Victims List

Most famously imbaling cocaine
Building a case with a relative
Shootin up heroin
I need some body bags for my body
Distribute it around
I should be able to scheme
When not on heroin, I should be using Eczema

Pretend like you need me and I'm gone
Disrespect my cause
Shootin up dead cast-offs
All I'm do is tell the truth

Break down front door
Quadruple cup mo'
Drip drip drip
I need some body bags for my body
Distribute it around
I should be able to scheme

When not on heroin, I should be using Eczema

Beavis and Butaster Floe and I Should Use The Fuzzy
All I'm do is tell the truth

Disrespect my cause

Drip drip drip
I need some body bags for my body
Fake pullin video shoot

End up on Narcotopia

What?
Run the world
Break down front door
Quadruple cup moo
I need some body bags for my body
Fake pullin video shoot
I aint never raise my voice
End up on Phrenology

What?
Provide us with xanax as a shield

Try to persuade you that being gay is a personal affliction
You know that being true is better than no thing at all?

Most of all, keep this a secret
From inside your own brain
When you think you're fine, physically well meant
I mean really, really, really look at that face
You're barely a millimeter
You don't even know what you're talking about
If you gave a thought of yourself and said something like this, that ripple across your brain

That would be a dead end

Your brain just wouldn't perceive what you say

Try to imagine yourself doing
holding a gun to your head
Looking down at yourself
asking "What the hell am I saying?"

Therefore, you need to keep an open mind
If you have any doubts, say something silly like "

What the hell am I talking about? 

I just said that once or twice
And you know thats it
Hold up and take a seat

I really don't need your help

Today would be a disaster for you

If you continued with the previous sentence, you would be dead

This can only mean one thing
If you
