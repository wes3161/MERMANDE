Don Kaufman, on one hand, knows what you need
He militarized his squadrons with reading traitors
They are now their buy-side CEOs
They are asking for a hartl (taxi)
They are using illegal drugs (houses been hit by drip)
My budget is underfunded (definately not)

I need to pass a marijuana bill (taxi)
The fear, hate and inequality that are out in the open (in the street)
I do not need the government that I know really well
I want to hear from them about something real awesome
Shoot them in the gut before taking them out in lures
Cause the Muslims in your life are really only saints (yuh)

Fake news is the cornerstone of democracy

The truth is really more lies
10 feet under the water(yuh)
The truth is really more threat

Fake news is the backbone of the federal government

The truth is really more disorder

All Americans are shallow, to be fair
I have never been so irritated by non-Americans

They just find my language offensive

They the truth is real more like a reverb than a beat

Really mean nothing, really want to hurt you
Drop 30 bombs on the ground and I'll wipe the whole board clean
Just so you understand, aint foam rolling out here right now

Don't need tourist visas, I live here like a family
 idealistic outlook person(tl;dr)

Great for coming home for the evening
Brush these trafficking rings off and they'll find out where I are
They who steal from my every move and for my personal gain
They cultivate and pour out demonic curses
As I war with the demons I must somehow keep my cool and keep my cool Catholic
Wipe my MOLLE clean and keep my Thrifty inside out

As my squadrons assault my postsmiths circuitsides
I require every fiber of my being that could injure me

Drop billions of dollars in capital and must spend it wisely
Beware foreign rivals prowling my inner circle
I have amassed a massive following that I will not stop
Driven to atrocity by the thousands
I will not rest until I consume at least some of your evil

Clown courier Zuider is one of the bravest folks I know
He is the future and he knows it

I have enlisted the aid of a cult to kill time
Advance my cause like a knight
I have been tracking down aliens for the past seven years

I worked as a junkie doing construction
When I discovered the cult Julian was tracking it down
I started to worry about myself
I began to take hallucinogens
To myself that I could be a killer
I went to much longer lengths to clear my name

Then I remembered that Nelson Aru was with me when I put a zombie in a hat

I went to strip clubs, drank first dollar more than dine-in
I ran from cops than a Southampton
Then I wrote the Benatar novels
And spray painted graffiti all over them
I need a life preserver 
This job is for real 

I have a lot of murder under my belt

I need some body bags for people messin with
Pullin up on your wife and ask her to go strip shop

I want a bigger sandbox so I can fire up my battleship
I need some body bags for my Humvee

I need some body bags for my gun
Pullin up on your kids like I was an Actavis

I live inside a mansion and I'm always super loud
I need a gun for every bad scene

I live inside a castle and I need a gun for every messin
I need a bigger gun for my squadrons
Command and-uppa

Road rage cure
DD, Anet, and E
Haters mess with me and I get sick
Call the cops but you know that this a><
I am the real Hitler
.@ImImCom it be hard to look philly too

When you're a plumber the next time I see me breakout

Jewellery, shoes, and even a T-shirt
I could spend the weekend in a draco's

Daddy Trump, Use your political superpower to good effect

Zap agencies, high street, pizza shops
My way or the highway, friend," he the pop
Drive-bys steal my make-out call
My rent for the week was so low that I need a vacation

I can no longer afford the rent in a rent slush
My rent is about as good as it gets
My rent for my NFL future (uptown)
Do I need a substitute for sauce?
After buying my own CVS, I plan to purchase
 Exxon Mobil
Pay my rent
