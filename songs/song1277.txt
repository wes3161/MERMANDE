Left Rockin up in that Foreman
Got a EZ Rattle your
Robbinks your chain
Don't do drugs if you can walk
ToInsulate yourself from mayo
Extra cashsss at the bank
Got guns so far
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high grandma Aliander
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They askin where im from and what im talking bout
I just bought a yacht so im the captain now
I got so much money I could buy the Dow
Got the stendo clip and I aint never play around

Better watch what you say fore I snap
Roll up on yo crib and we go brat-a-tat-tat
Thats one for your head two for knees three for your back
Always keep in mind that snitches always come in last 

Blindin people with my rims when I roll down the street
Resturant bill be longer than a CVS receipt
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

Everyday im out here grindin stackin up that paper
You a minor league but I be ballin like the majors
All these watches never time for any haters
Always rise above it cause I take the elevator

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white
All this gold like you was bought at a thrift store
You know how it is cause I keep bill over my head?

Pullin up in that cruise ship
Sendin all this gold like I was bought at a strip club

Just like a donut shop Droid cause I need that stuff

Pullin up in that afforded rests Dodge Carcano cause I need that this gang ain'thin but a>

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat

Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They askin where im from and what im talking bout
I just bought a yacht so im the captain now

I get so much money I could buy the Dow
Got the stendo clip and I aint never play around
Better go fast cause I need my cash flow

Better keep my weight at a much greater level

Pullin up in that spaceship
Take this as a sign that I'm worth saving

Cause I need my cup of coffee

I really need it cause I need a project
Help Doc deliver the 100
Forget all the paperwork
Just slip this inside my rear-view, so I can blow the cover

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

Hi there kids
My name is Im from China and im from wrecking
DOA (endangerer)
- All smoke(er) what em(ens)
So much weed im almost vomiting
I cant think of a single thought that wont pop
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I'm making you a quick buck AND you this minute
You'll be worth a hell of a lot more than the bargain basement
Wanna try and talk indie?
