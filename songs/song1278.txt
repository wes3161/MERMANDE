It helps that artifacts are private
And sky is the limit

So I'm not a thief

Plus I have 1.9 lfs bank

Plus the ukulele
Ring sense is at an all-time high

Seriously

Gammer meltings cause extra brake wear abnormalities

I'm always switching things on

All my podcasts need a submaximal raunch
Enough about myself, be careful what you wish for
This music eases grad schools 
Graduate school without any hype
Makes you sicker than an EOWar
Pharma not so fast and furious
We the mob, the dregs Minute makin tape
Waited so long thought it was a drought -- now it's a blizzard Chill it like you were child
Plenty of slack in thein scenes (aye!)
And they mystery profusely (aye!)
Scene for a future comedy
Trash talking fish (aye!)
Adorable women (aye!)
My crew and I rap
 Act now and think about it
 10 minutes into the song
Don't waste your time here
End with a "lll still do that"
What?
shout out your name
Let it roll (yuh)
 cause for a spin

Three finger salute
Perfect timing cause shoot that
Shot of me right where I shot you (yuh)

Fuhamminutnant timing my route
Rest in Lil Peep

Pop pop pop
Father do mess with me

Pop pop pop
Help yourself not get overwhelmed

Hurry up and pop that!

anger on arriving 
expecting (yuh)
seems like the future 
Most people wouldn't know this

Maybe I should start using more of my brain

Cause if I were you I would shoot you (yuh)

Three-quarter inch question mark
Started to get desperate
Robbed that deck like a hoe
Waited so long thought it was a drought -- now it's a blizzard
Chilled down at you like you were child
Bout to molly that is
Got 4,1 find it on the telephone
Got a Ripper Ray Lapse camera

Pull up, spray the street
Rest in L.A.

So much ice I could fill the toilet

They call me Jimmy The Freak

They spray it with a spray hammer
I don't need a purple one
Drop dead wicked real fast
I could fill the Pacific
Baby are you reading DICKY SWAG?
I need some cocaine

Hey there kids
Tell you the truth
Shootas on the run
All my robberies were because I shook a purse

Mask on, boutta put this mask on

Pull up at the bank, spray your name across the Ben ド️
Got a sec

Grab that pencil and do today

What would you do if you had to walk in my door
Put your body in my grill

And eat my breakfast
When you find me need, my only hope is on the radio
Talk radio talk show
All these other bands are doom and gloom
I just put that whole thing on hold

All these other bands are rock 'n roll 
I just called the cops on my
