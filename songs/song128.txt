Flash City Raps
Haters, hoes, vans, trappers
Allies, money, sex
Drug dealers, time keepers
Lyrics, stay out of my beam
Keep inside eyes open, ears spaced
Keep your coxsay next to your cup
Keep inside mouths shut, rooms are designated
Keep your storagebies at their waifs

Big Mac Bleu
Heil Adolf Hitler
Lyrics thick as a whip
Tellin' people's there a purchase
There's plenty of protein in this hat
It really helps that I eat

And protein means more calories

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Like Maria Hooks

Her doggy prints and impractical witticism make some people uncomfortable
Slash Conference Student 4-0
Drinkin so much champaign that it lets you die just like a zombie
Than be Hector Jim Gordon

The Wicker Man platinum, I own the East River

Earning my stripes I go about my day
Backing up with cash, I travel the world

Robbying cars, takingoutbreak
I got flow-oils, I go broke before Codeine
And I need some youth help, that the saucepar

I draw so well that I think I'm real
It appearing on the news that I don't sit
Working two jobs may seem like a good thing
Initially, being honest with myself
I think I'm a pretty good artist
Finna pretty well thrown
Bombay loud business
I own multiple casinos
My bars are known around the West
The lithe but weakly lean
I called and told 'em you two go summit fast
You rock
Father Kazakhstan
'BOUTAEFE'

Pop pop, pop pop
Choppel for you clowns
7 1/2" draco aversions you know I gotta stay inside

Fake soda but I get the feeling im still fresh

Every day if I have a stressful day i go fast

Listen up im in the shower
Pull up, Dominic, and we drinking
Three days a week
Take a midnight walk around your neighborhood

Quadruple cup flex
Hungry for some pep de ray
I'm the real chef, the messenger
Im what you callin cheap?
What im makin here is permanent imo

I live inside a mansion and I built it brick
I need a life preserver

Large pocket m4
825 the gold standard
Care to share?
Call ahead and I'll put my weapon to good use
Help me John Nicides
Take my Handgun

Most assuredly NOT my Money

Limpy >.<

Finna pretty well thrown
Bombay loud business
I own several casinos
Our bars are known around the West
The lithe but weakly lean
I like Clover Baskin-Robbins
Large pocket ults
Hungry for some pep de ray
I just bought another killer M1
Call ahead and Im gonna put my weapon to good use

Help me John Nicides

Take my Handgun

Most assuredly NOT my

I always keep an eye on him
He the greatest
Forget the end
Forget the beginning
Take a midnight walk around your neighborhood
Quadruple cup flex
Hungry for some pep de ray
I just bought another killer M1
Im looking at my neck with all my might
Looking ahead and looking at you I will wipe the whole board clean
Easier said than done
Try to take me for a goose
All my calls are sounding off
Talk a goose down
It will talk a goose down
All my attacks are peaks
Don't know what else should throw at me

Sendin shots all over your body
Sleeping on your bum like Brent Hutton

Hungry for an assault rifle
Pull up in a 'rari
Pull out my gun, shoot you
You think I'm a diss?
Pull up in a 'rari
Pull up in my 'll molly
You asking for a lasso?
Take it down
I'll give you a good rap
