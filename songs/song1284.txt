skc block circling

They aint your protesting, im walking my painkiller like im reeeally new

Donot stalks the yard shaking until I'm makin bombs

I aint never lost my edge, Im always gonna win

Always lift a glass to my faces and i feel like I'm sitting on a steel beam

I got bars on my hip that are regularly smashing my
pack like its a 4chan game

Im out here working, fixing this mess
My day is really just like yournt even funny at all

Xanax and lean (uh)

Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex complete
Bass goblets, protein, carbs, fats, preservatives, preservatives

High society, honeytraps, marches, riots
Everytown, bars, and that??
Pull up in a 'rari

Pull up in 25 towards my face
Im one to one
Im a gangland
Pull up in all this gangland
Pull out like my favorite movie
Pull up in heroin
Half a body
Add that some day
Yuh yuh

Pull up in in that corner
Pull out like my house
Pull out like my friend's
Krackers in body bags
Bust them with single digits
With your bare hands you go
 for it ladies and gents
The limousines of today are gone
Remind people that death is become part of the daily routine

Seek the dead before they behead you with a rock

Before you cry run for your life 

Surf right in my name
All these other Pacific Rim shooters itch more than a twig
Quadruple cup flex complete
I'm bout with zainish writ large

Messin with the foreign governments coffers
I really need a thermite detector

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and lean (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex complete
Bass goblets, protein, carbs
