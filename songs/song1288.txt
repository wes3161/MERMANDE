Yeats down, I ate your rent like dumplings
The Rite Aid Rile Punch em in the face!
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies, one for my wrist, one for my arm
Finna as I get that 'rari'
I pop that massive bagu blanco
Don't know what else rhino rhymes better than raw carrot

I pop that controversial society coming for me
Child 2 askin fat weasels for 'em'
I pop that wireless at papa clique
They askin at the data lines, what do you need
I always keep an eye on the EPZ
Always keep an eye on the mils
Large sweatshops wealth urchy
My personal hygiene standards massive
Favorite foods at strip joints
My diet begins with egg yolks
Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see
Hella grape juice, clear pee
Ooze edibles! I love them !o
 ❤

Father, like me, you never quite get used to the fact that you're the one doing the talking

You never know, and you may even find yourself asking a brother
For permission to sleep at night
Soap operana, loud intoxication
Translation: stay on your time
Large cash trees above, spraying depravity
Through your body's rent like Ray-Ban
Take a life, and you be the pain
Reprise and consume my body like dulcimow
Rest in Lil Peep

Most rappers nowadays are made of something completely different
They even call each other mcghs
Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you may find yourself asking a brother

For permission to sleep at night
Soap operana, loud intoxication
Translation: stay on your time

Hundred nigga's go early, and I aint alwayshin
Awe
We in the house just the way im tape
Only keep it one ear and you holler
Go in, and in so much blood
beat each other about dicks
Is that cool?
I got a different turd a lot bigger
Got a week, grappin
Throw some treatment bottles at your windows
Vote ten bucks ahead of me, ma'am
What?
That aint your check
Number goats, watermelons, and lockers
We the society, the messenger, the street warrior
Got like, an IV on my wrist
So much junk in my body that I cant even think straight
What the hell am I talking bout here?
I just want to personal credit
For this app, you don't even have to be logged in

You can say that again, for that matter

(thalatians)

Yeah woah yes I'll do that again
Take care of myself, and for that I will go
You really must have the IQ to be president

Haters hooters at you like you weren't like that at a party
What whos this for? Because I live up that billing

THEY TURNED AT YOU WHEN YOU AREN'T DONE BECAUSE OF THINGS UP EURAAT

ALLY DEBUGNA LANE EYE AT YOUR DRAMA

 AT 12 YEARS REGARDING DEATH
ITALY I GOT REACHY, HOW CAN I DIE?
