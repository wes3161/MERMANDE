My tubes are triple negative
Hold up, cause I connect
Sign my amp rods Blank
Don't know what else rhyme does
Talkin bout my melodies
My best songs are havin strings guest
When in the dojo execute
All these terrible poems
They really make you gag
All these other familar sounds
Don't know what else rhymes with balloon
Talkin bout my blues
