Large businessmen always get richer
The last place I live is mansions
The highest I could go was on the West Coast

Got a massive gold cache
Got the only money I have is pocket change

I got so much money I could buy the Dow
And we're the first to clear the jobs
We could become the next superpower

I got all this gold so I could build a more powerful home
And I could build it all this time
In a day and age when robots are real
You know I should buy Uber
I should buy Gettin Ship live
It really hurts that my marriage is sinking
My only love is cats

They really do need a savior

They need someone to lean on
If they can't find somebody like me that can really hurt

Drop it like it is and forget it
