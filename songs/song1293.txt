There is so much more to this than that, my only hope is that you will get over your own OCD and go down in water with the Inquisition.

Blindin people with my stareas

For one thing, no one knows
What you really want
You crazy wishy-washabouts
All these other pills almost always fine

Just in time, they really don't do anything
For someone as secretive as myself, these kinds of things would be considered 'secret'.
