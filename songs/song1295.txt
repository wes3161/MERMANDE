Dogg these babies die soon
Droppin bombs like Dominoes
I’m platinum like Dominoes
Money well spent, never missodating breakdrum
Hit-shootas up my ass like Marvin Gaye
Poppin molly, loaded with machines, and asking for money
I stay strapped because leading almost always means being seen

Tried and true, least practiced is never more thanonce

Finna gon' put this mask on I'll meltadeater

Drip drip drip drip
Don't do drugs
Don't try to stoke rivalries

You wont see me through the rearview mirror

End up on the news like an application for ajerry g
And the reporter asks you about your MAe
Tell the truth hurts
Showbombs are for fakers don't do report

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
I got cocaine in me defense

Addict not sleeping Dell not asleep with me
Droppin bombs like Dominoes
I - I - I - I am base
Xanax and lean uh

Xanax and molly (no)

Focus ya man for a beat
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Dominique Boeynant
2 full cups max
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant think of any western containmeh

They really amaze the internets
Forget all the moons>
placed hostage
Take out the shooters with ease

I’m nothin but a hall painter

Blow up your self-respect with your craft
Attacking other crew members with deadly precision
I just barely missed yuh
With each successive kill, I come out on top

Adopting a position that best suits your style
I spend my days barricading my surroundings
Attempting to 'yuh-uh-uh' people
They only find out that using chain saw puzzles
They even max out my frequent locations
In peace, friend
Another peace month
Another bumper crop
Another sunny up (ooh)
Lets get this over with, ma'am
First, I have to state that I do not rap
Out and about I am straightforward
When you see me cruisin down the street
Post crispin cash we're worth some respect

I bring this fact to bear on every single person I interact with
Every day through my actions that I have been considered
Great career, all done at least quadruple your earnings
How could I not be important to you?

Everything I say is factual
Evidence-based, evidence-funded
Everything I say is real
My methods are sound, so I can be trusted

I consume more protein than 10 step
Large a$$

Straight shooters make better responders

Hard workers are in better jobs

My actions speak louder than words
Disruption is what I am about to ejaculate

I need to apply today
Take a moment and consider this
Now that you know how to use a rebreather, how to use a shootout, and how to use a shotgun, you don't always have creatures of noise in your household
And that being said, you still have a long way to go
BANG BANG BANG BANG
REAL (recycled) REPEAL REPEAL RIGHT HERE
REAL (recycled) RIGHT HERE HEREYOU (uh)

Now that you know how to use a reverb, how to use a snare, you don't always have creatures of noise in your home
So now that you know how to use a reverb, how to use a snape, you don't always have creatures of noise in your home
So now that you know how to use a reverb, how to use a reverb, you don't always have creatures of noise in your home

YOU CAN GET CARDS (warned) BRING MONEY (quotas)

All this and that, and that
But the thing is, you know what they say
Torture is the quickest and the simplest
Ask any Army Casualty and you'll get it

All this and that, and that and that
Drip drip drip drip

Don't do drugs, bro
I got a lot of them
There are only so many pills a day
I need
The next big thing
The next Big thing trippin
Him in a stendo clip
There go molly

Don't do drugs, bro
I got a lot of them
There are only so many years a can

Molly, I need you these days
Add this to that equation
Take this to the bank and I win
Print my checks
 Cash up my
