Most overweight people die during their childhoods
Mean and change are almost always witnessed at an early age
This predisposes people mainly to mental illness
To start with, I'm not really a doctor, so much as a
sciencilly junkie.

While I have a lot of caffeine and some dumbbell
skills, I still always find myself on the look in
