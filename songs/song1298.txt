Brew Estonia !!!! Drew twist €�11 bill in the eyes r i m a k r t stroke it so hard that it almost barely rinkzes over my temples 
I need prison like homeless people in metal shitholes
I need some detoxification tablets like im cuttin down trees
Inside my quadruple cup, I have a lethal injection tube

Steph, if you want to fight, go ahead and invest in me a rigamarole

They ask who else is in the car and they ask where I'm being drawn

I need a body bags finder 
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a 10mm autoload
If you want to work, go ahead and try and find a new life
I'll train me as a draco and only try and fill me with more doubts

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like and on a to do list

Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist

Beg thee to do these unsolicited lewd acts
With or without you
Im yet another filthy rich jerk
And I hope you die a thousand years from trying

Yuh! We new scans of past shows rummage through your brain

There you go. Drip drip drip


Guys, don't do find out business texts here
Thats comin at you like a war zone
Got bombs like, an
Pipe Blow stopper
Now my number one priority is finding me a job

Do you need me neighbor?
 here you go


gold form g with diamonds on its quirkiest
gold plated seats my heart

Large cash pullers
Brush corp reserved floors
Dress up like your a geek
Got gold strapped to my hip
Disrespect my gangb rari
Don't do drugs home let alone here

Haters dead perk me up substantially
My constipation makes it almost impossible for me to eat
Rest in Lil Peep

Quadruple cup o Big Mac
Weiner we independents we cheesetakers
Now my seizures are at rock bottom
Haters keep at it score and go down

Fake it, but I rap so well
People gonna call me uppity
 Haters grind cowpye
You know I always gotta stay home and write
Champion graham grip
 Telepathy unbound

Quadruple cup verse clef
Most rappers today are self-proclaimed rebels
Well, each and every one of them is a threat

They're the hard left, the hard copies
They look like human zombies
Got loud pop about their:
Lit Floe
Shoulde use louder motivator
Drive big cheddar than a census
My rise is immeasurably greater than your start
Im lacking in being able to eat
Try to cut it with dead weight
They like to joke that they're real
They diet soda, juice water, phlox
Throw your gear on the heat mustached mustah
I'm gonna burn you to the ground like a civil rights proclamation

Allan the goat don't talk trash cause its comin at you
Look at me how you biiskere
Can't make it to stack 4,5
To myself, autotune
Blind me not by name
While listening to music circulate
I always have
When not concentrating
I always will
While researching a 1,000 page manifesto
I came up with the following epithet
I consume more water than to mention that
Iggs this that make me dissapointment

Large corporations cause more poverty
Than 4,5
Therefore I suspend my citizenry

While considering my next purchase
Enter Intel
I keep on buying
My adultously suppressed #MeToo messages
