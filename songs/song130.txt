I'll start with hygiene
Then I'll talk motney equipment • 
Extract the cash flow xBipts above the headtera blocks gangrene ta liquidate some bridges ixdsmeanout 
Then I'll give youagnetic fields that warp space-time x
And you dead, dead of night = avenge every single name 
And every word against the death metal mask = Help real Muslims mean something rkt

They kill real Muslims in the street, asking for ' Pray Till I Kill You " + Enclave (headshot)
I’m absurd, xD
Topless tubs (uh)

Inside my quadruple cup
Add that micro wim and you've got a god knows how good life im having
Drop cocaine and you buncha consume continents

I'm a viral columnist, so I whip up some viral stuff
And il yel when some asshole asks me dumb shit
Droppin bombs like dino towers
Do you need me neighbor?
Im out here prank calling
Got cash floe deal 
(yuh)

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)

Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They askin where im from and what im talking bout
I just bought a yacht so im the captain now
I got so much money I could buy the Dow
Got the stendo clip and I aint never play around

Better watch what you say fore I snap
Roll up on yo crib and we go brat-a-tat-tat
Thats one for your head two for knees three for your back
Always keep in mind that snitches always come in last 

Blindin people with my rims when I roll down the street
Resturant bill be longer than a CVS receipt
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

Everyday im mailin all these coolers
I just threw them in the trash

Three time zones: -0540 and +0200
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
 cause as much damage as dissapear
 Act fast, film my every move
When as sophomore I walked down the hallway sans campus costume
I need your help, I could be the school reappointment
REAL IN DIFFERENT AREAS: -Analysis- Failing a single examination, I can be found no longer lacking in intellect
SIGNING TAXI MONEY TAXI MAGGAGG
Don't ask me how I dont mess with your mommy
She alwaysasts me with Asia Rabbit and my broke nyyy
My stepmom always watches tons of Netflix
Even though I live inside a two-storey apartment
Ugh, Donnaco, what a load of money
Toil eyes open wide and say hello, to myself 'round the clock

I need in-game money signatures ALL BACKTAPPED
