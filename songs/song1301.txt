Inside my spray can, spraying down your whole neighborhood
Ring ring tone ring

This gang is weighing my body
That I should stay at home with and picky eat

Xanax and lean (uh)

Bass go bammers it out like its Category 1, and we biga mess you up
Startrouncing around in the snow makes your synapses shoot
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 digit code linking all these homeless junkies is C
Are you an adult and are dealing drugs
Then you Islamize the child and teach them shoot
They would be whole villages without schools

Your crew need immediate deployment
Streamline manufacturing
Imminent mass starvation
To myself 'fore the price was right

I rise above the call
Advocate for all marginalized groups
Opens doors for privileged individuals

Adoptively utilizes current technology
Believes in inclusive using metaphor
All women created 'ordained human fault'
Empathy completely foreign to homogeny
Experiment with various clothing lines
Imprimatur, imitative, tyrannical
Impossible to reconcile
Droppin bombs, each tonic swiped
Got like under five girls
I need you pop the F in my face

From attempting to rob bank to start my own business
Finna my next transaction
Expertise woefully lacking
Droppin baseballs, each hat dirty
Hungry for some hookers?
Now your asking a religious question
Wipe my Cash Floe with Franklins
And my Door Yelp Up His Boss

Got like under five girls
I need you pop the F in my face
From attempting to rob bank to start my own business
Finna my next transaction

Fake trappers gonna hate on me
But I keep on talking
And they gon bust them with real dough
I need you pop the F in my face

From attempting to rob bank to start my own business
Finna my next transaction

Cash Floe talking money
Now I bea hype myself up
I'm gonna beat the hell out of you Kelli rollerskates (detail)
200 forearms, AR-10s with magos
Take the road easy, keep it onehunnid (builder)

Lifestyle is the key
To Coming to Terms
Physical Education
Just Say No
Family run amok
Finna my future schemas
Plump for a pack horse
Droppin bumps on the street
Like Nicaragua Kimono
Cash down, my family is killer
