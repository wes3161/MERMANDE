Take it like
I told you so
Got it with me, paycheck to paycheck
You know I always gotta stay strapped
Cuz the oldschool sellout song
When you find out that we are real killas than shed some 1, 2, 3, 4
Makin dough, Rigging
5 Billion Bets in a Day
Reminds Mea Homogeny
That We Cubans Made Cash

White Ghost Sweats

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Choppa out here. We hiss all these watches

Pullin up in that Lamborghini

Pullin up in that that reminds
Of an old Navy Humvee
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in that white Ghost

Quadrilla up in that white car
Talkin bout my ankle
You know I always gotta stay strapped
Come on, brother, how bout I fit in better?

I got a lot of watches, buddy
But when it comes to like my ankle, I cant even begin to rock

This aint peachy so
I cant get staring

Get on the car, acceleration is about to stop
I gotta get this hella loud
Put this mask on!

Got gold-plated grill surrounds
Large, cash-strapped security at your front gate
Lacking supervision, I always keep my staff informed
What you buy, how you spend it, and how you spend it gone is how you die

My numerous bars keep other bars numerous
My lean-tos mean I cant solely rely on myself
I get the point?
Drip drip drip drip

All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip

Got gold-plated wristwatches
