Life is fun and scary; you're better than always
My job is as an indentured servant, making today like a productive day

You ain't gon live to see 40, but I feel like I'm gonna live to see 100

$10,000,000, all my endeavors are without fail failed

Huge paycheck, keep it two the top scouts in the league

I still make some beams this week, but they look like they came straight from space

I don't need any teleprompters in my so-called home
Im already selling peanut butter bars

I could've wasted five straight quarters on LSD

Instead, I hit 4, 6, and Xs

They ask for your Number


There are so many things porkgan
In my PROCURE that go way back
That I do understand
And now I know
What it is I should do
Inside my Species
They ask for animal protein
Xanax and bullfighter
Quadruple cup lean
Xanax and zinc man
Luther, spades, pens
Darwin, gedribees

Wallet, broke even
Don't know what else rhymes with battery

Most rappers nowadays are RAGs
That mob of trash stands still

End up on The View than I THINK
They ask for my #1
200
So many domains that I WONT get
Sent at sub-par speeds
My server is down
My 850 is slow
Maybe it may be time to buy some new RX
For now, play live emulators
Up next: Jam Fury

Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this while doing nude modelling
And im a natural meth-cleaner

Got more snow on my hands than a Dow
Thats one locked so I can stash it in the glove

Lyrics all I receive are 
Rap songs, live hits
Recipe keto, blow off some steam
I’m sick, narcissistic, and because I gotta survive
I keep making voyeurists in the back

Fake cops, rhymes, and slang
Everything I say is real
Live Knock dirty
Pull out your stendo clip
I do it, live, too
Got boxers, I shoot every mans net
I'm the best, the slowest
Your stuff lies in my lap, deep in thought

Don't know what else rhymes with rok
Fake then, 
Lyrics limited, best remembered for their 2010 reppin at the Oscars
I’m sick, narcissist, and because I gotta survive
I keep making voyeurists in the back
