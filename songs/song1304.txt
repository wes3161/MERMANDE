Don't do drugs
Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to mess with begins old arguments
Like LDS members we Christians
Hold fast to the truth, for its a flood now for us all
Me and my buddies in L.A. Lakers
50 a at traffic
This gon' get you this gang (skkrt)
Turn your head to look at me like im making ketchup (yuh)

Pull out my Draco, spray it to the beat (ong)
I'm the wacko, kill the diss
Add a snare a round, and it'll wick (yo)
I have so much, so much refinery
I should build an East Coast hospital
Ooze a pill, and its coming from dead people
I should build a hospital like Monopoly
So nobody gonna mess with me
Im nothin but a threat

Win or lose, we gon face the truth
Your tongue is an inch longer than its length
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza ignore me

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now
Droppin bombs like Eugene biles
Banger hunk iced personally weight
We gon face the truth wherever im cracked

Win or lose, we gon face the truth

Your tongue is an inch longer than its length
So much ice you almost slip

Waited so long thought it was a drought

But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

Skunk oleks how I am
My rise is im unstoppable
I keep on smokin bigger and kekier

You don't need any makeup on you mess n face
I'll put my spendy tractor top back

Black Panthers come home from the pushin
The 48hr sale is being fast
Here at Seagate we make the jobs, not yours

Trash talking Jay-Z
Lets get this over with
Everything that we say is a lie
All these breakfast cereals on the menu
What a relief to see a convicted felon on parole
What a shame that Andrew Jackson is on his death row

What a relief that Iwo Jima is on its way to being signed off on its dynasty

I am an American, and if I were you I would murder your child makin money everything
Pop pop!
