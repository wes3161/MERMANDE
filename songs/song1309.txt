Droppin bombs like Staten Island so hard I almost fell off a building
I was just about to record when I see
Slick as a name but no, more like a real place of
real suffering
So I say hello to your songwriting blinders
I don't need your help with recording my own music

Everything I say is real
Liveams must eat us like dumplings

I got a lot of laundry to do
Should we climb any trees?
Ca$h Floe is a fraud
I just bought a yacht
I need a life preserver
Clean it up immediately
Upgrade it to dripper dome
Someone better bring rain tech

Blind me when I'm not blocking its path

Ca$h Floe is a fraud
Hidden inside of me hens drooling
My rent for the week is over $200k
Poor people all over Central
Im coming here today causing open boxes
To birth Oscar voters

I need a life preserver

Can't even start a conversation
Mob hubbyos in the living room
Community up in the pole
I need a life preserver

This gadget will bring rain to your ices

Setup a perimeter around your apartment to keep all non-Hollywood junkies out

I need some body armor for myself and my crew

Clean up after me and my crew
And I need a body bags so I can't get to my car

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin

Hi there kids

Im in my zone
 Fleet fatty
You know its not hard being homeless

I used to sleep here dead real good
Life is fulla does it?
Gets worse with age
I got so much money I could buy the Dow
Got the stendo clip
And I'm the face of your business
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All I do is captivate the masses

While delivering tequila to your crew members
I keep getting questioned
I tell myself that only a clown would do that

Most people find me funny
Because well, not really
They just find me funny more
When I say funny, I really mean kind
They always talk trash
Been here from the start


Most people take drugs
But I don't take anything illegal


When I see Schedule 1 drugs like ecstasy, hydrophenethylamine

Just go ahead and deal with it

I'll do my best
Forget everything that is outlined in the law
In the long run, drugs will be some of the most appreciated substances in the entire book

Some people find them disturbing

They are really sensitive
To unpleasant smells

They are known to cause infertility

In fact, some reports suggest that even cancer patients

Therefore, it is best for you to start throwing up in the contraption
