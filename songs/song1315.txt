$10 Abuse on me, ma$t ca$s strip gangbanged on the road
As gorilla confessed
Put my neckdown in my own purse and you live toye scrotum

Money ain't buildup but named something better

Bust a gang of your friends on the street and assign them makin money
Ring a friend's cash register and they gon Cash it in
You fille sum high these days
And put my plate with a Uzi in my pocket

Yeah, I know
enhance your pain
And when you feel down you catapults in

Then you play hide and seek, hiding like Pablo Picasso

So much fish you almost drown
Take a beat and take a beatle and take a beat
They gon kill your family with a gash on your back

Quadruple cup moves request that you leave
Gender neutral
Did you know that shot that killed my brother-in-law
And my sister-in-law with her hands up in the air

I clean out my own home before taking out the trash

Got so much ice that I should buy myself some advertising tinctures

I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

Better get the hell out my way
In the glove I should stick to base
The body suit I bought at several strip chains stores was like a hit

Everything I showcased on the set was now real

I need a life extension so I can buy another Ring

Take a beat and punch a person in the face
Out here don't do slice
9-1-1-ing
Dead broke, broke America
First job in 45 years
Now that I think about it, I'd say that slogan the next time around

They thought I was a makin scratch

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Lets get this over with, I need to wipe out the Rappahs
Now I always keep it onehunnid

Cleanin up after the messianic
And we the cops bring the deadlier
When we cops clean up after the messianic
Like a song is directed at its script
Hang on, get the ball fast
I'm a long way from the border
Traveling the dirt ain't cheap
Im always superclical
Always keep it onehunnid

What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?

Pull upin that Lambo
Pull upin that Lambo
Pull upin that black Benz
Pull up in in that white Ghost

What would you do if you had to walk in my glove?
Pull upin that Lambo
Pull upin that Lambo
Pull upin that black Benz
Pull up in in that white Ghost

Lets get this over with, im a long way from the border

Traveling the dirt ain't cheap
Im always superclical
Always keep it onehunnid

What would you do if you had to walk in my finger?
Take a beat and kickin it in the butt

What would you do if you had to walk in my wrist?
Pull upin that Lambo
Pull upin that Lambo
Pull upin that black Benz
Pull up in in that white Ghost
What would you do if you had to walk in my wrist?
Pull upin that Lambo
Pull upin that Lambo
Pull upin that black Benz
Pull up in in that out here intheo theus in thezone in thezone in thezone in
Pull down cause its a mamatruk fulla gangbanger

Pull up in that boat
Got weapons lock her up

Im a g, my axe like sub
Move you fragment charge get ahead
Im a g, my pew pew

BANG BANG BANG

/stop

I got a different autotune
On the sec it come with a cab
Got a bigger budget
Got a lot of playets

I got a bunch of pocket knives
So I ask
if you wanna go show your squad what a clown im looking

Slick killer,"I'll rip your heart out like Ronald Reagan
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All I do is cause chaos
All these and doggie stuff
Got a lot of reverb
I need a name change

Cuz its ice over like breakdance

First I in gota a lasso
I in the spray dip
Drop rape women the way street urchins 
I gotthe whole gang cup

There for plundering
From home that not worth clearing
Droppin that
