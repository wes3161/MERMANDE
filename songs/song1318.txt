Shootin up autotunez
Hungry for some ramen
Got a cheap musutra in my lap
Im always super combative
Rallyin on yo house
When I say 'splashbang' you think twice about jumping in a Ryobi

Don't know what else rhymes with drip
Tap 'em with crayons

Shootin up yo body with mace

Got a metal sheath around my neck
They callin by the handful
Makin dough, Moto, and makin rides
You know I always gotta stay armed, ma lad
If I'm being Harley-i-George-ist I'm gonna melt some glass

All these other rappers sound like total trash
Don't need an introduction
Simply saying
Im the toughest thing in the hood
I really must offend some

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
