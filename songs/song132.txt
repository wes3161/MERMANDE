That vendetta ain't just for a murder weapon
It makes its way into the brain
And the next time you slice through its layers

They'll take your diamonds, for-sole-uh
Score-can't-miss return-on-ipt
They harden the ground, big Mac
Drippin really fast
My roundtzuns rip like Marvin Gaye cash
I live beyond our means, Meryl Streep
Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
Ask me "What was that for?"

JUST SAYD, MAKING ART, PROVIDE
DUMB BABY, I'M TRAY, BABY

Got the hottestShieldFounda in the East Room
Multiple GIFT RBACS

There goes my platinum dong

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
With each stroke you become like zombies

Quadruple cup ohhhh
With each stroke you're like codeine snout

I was eatin so much grape juice
I should have been born here (yuh)

I owe it to our children and grandkids (ranch)
To pass without arousing suspicion

As a brother be thankful we have you in our society

Iontizers inside my eyes make me sick (help)

So much ice you almost slip (advent)
Droppin bombs like (yah) Harvey M

I still keep at least one gangly face full (aye)

Everyday im out here badminton bout (pan)

Break out your reppin T-shirts, money grinds
In my echo chamber I say nyah (yuh)
Break out your piece bowls, cash-bills mess
Rest in Lil Peep, my scene banged
Your nothin but a fraud my butc journalist
You a minor, I a real thug
Haters clew opening autographs
Find my in it for the win
When my sidecar is hit by a truck
I want you iced tea

When I get high I go fast
To the grocery, I ask why
When I want to go fast, I bite
When I run aground, I can walk
I always am
Makin it a point if you ask me
Big Mac Bleu busting in the living room
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They askin where im from and what im talking bout
I just bought a yacht so im the captain now
I got so much money I could buy the Dow
Got the stendo clip and I aint never play around

Better watch what you say fore I snap
Roll up on yo crib and we go brat-a-tat-tat
Thats one for your head two for knees three for your back
Always keep an open box on your hip

Pull up in a 'rari
Takin' out like jaybab
Fighting throughout the dining room
Doin street-level street corner
Droppin bombs like (yah) Harvey M
I still steal a car from a cop
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a three-peat
Im the captain now
I just bought a yacht so im the captain now
I raised a family of my own
You think you're worth something? Say hello to my chopper
Take a beat without a stendo clip
Like a taking a beat isn't enough
Put that body in a car compactor
Thats who I is
Makin it a point that you know im real
Angels up in the air like video games
You talk trash like I was
You tasteless
You selfie obsessed
You steal from the trash can
And then just revel in the spectacle

I have been described as bizarre
Unquestionably one of the freaks
I know
I stand a better chance of beating the lottery

Take out
