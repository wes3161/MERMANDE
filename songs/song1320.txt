Like a ham, im taking your money
Got some tasty live spray
Take a beat, and steal it
And yeah, I sobbed a lot

While taking cheap rides
I also snapped some pictures
And wrote a blog

To highlight my known pests
And to briefly dispel any fears

I do NOT mean to be mean
 Feedback is what keep me going
⭐️ Win this game make money

And if I survive, I will make the money

You'll be sorrygrief Come to Jayzone
I need you
 Protected
( Say it ain't so)
Addicting hijacks recipes
But a smart as sliver of swag
I'll put that money where my keyboard is
When opportunities call for another shot
Take a beat, whip up some numbers
And gang rape some donkeys

I have a right to my personal destinies
Text when you cant take Text
I need you
 Protected
Xanax and lean (uh)
Haters respect assignments XANX TRY
To each his own
Display poorly judged assignments
End up on the news like a hound

Fake reviews persist on net
Don't do drugs! Hang on a second
All this trash talk will pay off In the not so distant future
I.''ll clear things out pretty f---in fast
My platinum records will buy you a mansion
Starta grindhouse background symphony
You gon get I'mnky beat and you somethin
You aint never change
Blindin people off with your scattered posh accessories
When you search for him remove them From Within You Evade Detainee(EE)
Disruptive lyrics accurately describe my mentality Foreshadowed executions darker than a beat
Always keep at it grindhouse action, voodoo stuff that made me thousands BACKLESS
Keep my tag flute in my lap like I was a German prisoner

Pull up, spray your crib with an AK
Got brownied da rear end
Got my Jute M Scope hooked
Got my Drip Adda Floe
Got my M4 Extended Beta

BANG bANG bANG (expando)
Another recycling incident Ripe caginess immerse your brain in
Once again you are beyond reason
Traumatize me with random acts of petty vandalism
While another recipient boasts of their vehicle
I continue to garnish upon top of you
When I spread fear and uncertainty throughout your person
I do so with alarming frightening effect
With each passing day each new disclosure
Like a fly coming at my wing

With each categorically untrue statement that I

Recovered them all from a distance
Im so careful with my crafts that I
 still slip
Clipped my signature shotgun through your front
Another time you were layed,
I MarcusARPED YOU WITH A MACHINE
Another time you weren't in your zenith

During our time undercover you
Im so thorough with my tools
That you wouldnt commit suicide

Fake various forensic examinations
Added a special reward for reports tripping
Surprisingly I still slip

Ca$h Floe clean my rear-end
All this junk new car radio asking
What was that for?
For God sakes we nothin

You and I can cop it
Got money fights like cancer

Fake trappers say funny things
Help me confused people

When you ask me dumb questions like "What are you doing here?"

What are you talking about?
A favor and I'll give you a heads up
Send in the Marines for a bit of my artillery

Lieutenant Colonel Waters have a secret weapon
You know me already
Always rise above it
Can't wait to start calling the cops
 Blog about my day Kleenex

Pull out my Draco, spray it to the beat
I could be crazy

My only requirement is that you at least put a hand up my ass
Don't talk trash because you really mess me
Look at all the gold in my belt

Give 'em the girl parts
 They wear winded vests
Theyb 'ball keep this gondola (on the way to work)

I need you
 in the streets
Ca$h Floe clean my intestinal passages
Pull up, spray my bank accounts
They call the cops but you know that already
They need to know how the lil eight-bit
Comtin my desk upside down
Put my weight behind me
.


Livin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo

Put my weight behind me

So many bars to myself
Even when I'm skyscrapin

Up in that Cayman
10 feet of mead justdroppin
Put that body in a van
I need you
 in the street

I got a lot
