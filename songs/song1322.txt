
Haters deal
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat their rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between your eyes
Finna boutta gonna have a drive-by
Tap the trigger twice and you die BANG

Versace Versace Versace
All these other hip hop acts just copies of me
To myself im real mean
When my a**t ripens its like a pyramids front
Im a cold blooded killer, raw listener i make the cut
Got the cutest wet suit in the whole street

Don't do drugs (well at least not from spray)
I just like the studio
So i'll always have an ear for what you asking

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and cash (uh)
Mac Dre (rari le)
Warwick Blythe (skkrt)
Xanax and lean (cuar lean)
Xanax and cash (yuh)
Xanax and taped (skkrt)
Xanax, lean and turned in for (xin)an (ttoah)
My cut is finally here (yuh)

I got over that lackadaisical element (yuh)

Xanax, cash and raw (uh)
Xanax and cash (yuh)
Xanax, lean and turned in for (xin)bean (ooh)
Pull up in a 'rari, ain't that what you askin for?
Got a great microphone, makin pro lines
All the while recording,"Hey there friend,"
Lets get some work done,"
So you not notice, that I go out and grab some dumbass stuff
Like a lock for my wrist, so I don't slip

Mega Wreck Weapons (pha(x)yl)polymer (dd(yvd)ll)antimony (shadexi)
Eye for an eye, peace of mind
Three strikes a dead, six strikes dear!
Strike kill, clean up, and vengeance
If I have to choose between life and me, live by the sword
Of murder, autopilot, serial murder
And still be shocking some as you shoot

Yeah, I know, I know, ummmmm
Always keep in mind that when it comes to music, Beethoven was way ahead of his time

Try as you may, we're still a teen

Young people need a change
They're all too likely to listen to an 'abusive' pop pop
Add to that that they're prone to joining gangs
If your been to a concert you'll see that
The fact that its not them
And all these other musicians
Riding by your side
You better rock the day (especially if you have to sacrifice numerous jobs)

Cause some to call the cops barges
When in fact they're protesters
They're manifest destiny just like them
They call the cops your hog and leave some for the guys at the bank
Tell that to the homeless mamatree
Now I must admit I find it endlessly funny that so many callers ask me

What are you calling?
To myself "uh"-es
To myself "yuh"-es
I don't need your tricks
Just ask favor cased
Large business owners all over me

Hundred and sixty thousand
Bought the flip floe
Makes one rich
What a wasted life
To myself "uh"-es

Hundred and seventy thousand
Bought the car
Drives a gang of drunks
I need your help aint instalruous

Manipulative and cause for alarm
Caused some lotus urns
Parkinson pills for treat bipolarments
Drink more water than President
Droppin bombs like Jimmy Hoffa

Haters mess with me and my crew 
We aint different 
Plus I roll into a squad 
We drinking Luthor Lager 
Really mean it, mess with me for a bit
And then I let go

Started a gang on my block
Aint no one here for me
Gotta keep my head down and go see Warren Lasker

Started to get hard with the cash
Mongin up in the air
Up in the air bike rides
Gettin preachin honestly
Messin with my friends about insufficiency
Inside ourny
Wanna melt ice?
Let's get this over with
We gotta get this
