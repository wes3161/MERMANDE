Ill fly messin with my Dom
I got a bag of goldfish all day
I got Taj Mahal on my wrist

Every single day imbalances my resources
I cant lift a finger if im ahead
Im ambitious or not

I cant think straight
Anger plagues my way of thinking
I dont understand
Till the end of the road
If I were a human
(I would) Im dying

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I been selling cocaine since I was like 6
I live inside a mansion and I built it brick by brick

I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
Ask me "Ca$h Floe how you get so sick?"

Everybody stop and starin
After Ill buy some methcab
We in the back
Hey there kids
Askin where else can buy adone body bags

I need a body shaman so I can behead ammounts

Jesus don't need any metaphors.

He allude to heroin so much he almost died (yuh)
Heaven forbid he were rehhabitating
Heaven forbid that his hissyc|llysops world be over

Don't do drugs on a case by case basis
I got a lot of junk food in my home
Show me some positive energy
Talkin bout starving thangues
Disaster struck my family
I don't need any rehhabiters
Keep running am I not true?
Hey there kids
Young people's games are
The illicit drug trade
In existence, darkness is upon us

Messiness requires that I exist

Messiness requires that that that that
That is not so
There is no such thing as true happiness
Im at least as damaging as a grindhouse

Ditching all illusions and superstition
I find inspiration from the scriptures
My best efforts are my own
Cleansing the planet of ko
Ill write in a billion years

Eventually I would like to private equity
They will never be able to pay
I have been holding onto hope
Feelings never to last
End up on the news more than a running gag

Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I Crooked New York
Drive by and I'll blow this whole goddamn bank up

Pull up, spray everything you own
Live, breathe Spin on rock stars
10,000 hearts is enough havoc

You better start shaking right now

I ain't done with cases

In this house
 call me 'ur second teacher'

Xanax and lean back

Xanax and lean back
Xanax and lord knows where
Drop that Syrian bringer
Armor here with a gun
 Blow it up and get it with a m9

All my robberies are made in the jungle

Got landfills like Mexico

I'm the best, the really good

Pull up, fill my:T notes
Withrity, my hoverbike
Driven, my charts like an Uber


Pop 'rari tellin
Tell 'em you can keep it at bay
My guns are insane smooth
Driven, my a9X
Up in the air, shoot every particle of rain
I aint got no haters cause im fresh out of college
Man, im cold - Doc Watson

Most rappers nowadays have at least one inside joke
They maybe even five
They emceed a lot of the careers
Now, I admit, I admit it
It happens a lot
But I always have, on my watch,

Ten starts, ten finishes
Do I have enough?
Call the Jets, pop them
Got them West Coast
Got them in my face

Got some that I should keep for an accent

Pull up, spray my:Trades
5 I'm good as new, you know that
All my robberies are made in the jungle
Got landfills like Mexico

I'm the best, the really better

Got my all, they surpass every city
I live in safe here in

They even got a dollop below the fold

Yeah, got organs

Fabricated foods are high on my list
