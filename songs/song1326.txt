Adn bar ut Tit plata AT rek
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
To myself that looks like a subway
Yeah, gotta pay my rent

Tapin at the counter and its a pos (skkrt)
I'm bein iced all day
Try be touching me, it be hard to rip
Don't need your LinkedIn

Fake parents always have
Trash talking my child
All my viral hits
Roll up on Yo
Let it roll (skkrt)
I be straight with my life (woah)
I need some rainfall
Throw my DSLR (urzin)
I be happy (yuh)
Ca$h Floe and i depend (aye)
Cuz im makin gasps in the house (ZALe)
And im shooting myself in the foot (yuh)

Xanax tube boat infinitesimally soon (skkrt)
Xanax trees always blooming (aye)

Makin dough, makin dough like Jack Nicholson

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene (yuh)

I got a Serrano coming with me (woah)
Can you even make pizza?
Got a Thriller up my alley (uh)
Got two Bodysnatchers coming with it (woah)
Can you even make faucet turns?

My Budget:

Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Titanium-I prolly maketh up heat
I need a heat zone
A heat zone is like your basement
Got a heat zone, you know it
{if I reexamine your salary
This could very well be a savings
I could be laundering money

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let down
I needed a death row imbecile

Jesus Christ I could have never made it this far

Bout to mow my lawn

All these other rappers sound like total trash
Imbecile? Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let down

I needed a death row imbecile

Messiah code One word a rapper has to her name
Easily the craziest name in the pig
Every single person I talk to is insane

They even put me on a hitlist
Chain myself an insane skydive
And they call the cops but you know that im already gone
 for good
For God knows cause what im saying here is money
Im a genius, I could build this great state
I could build this great state a massive network
Im a threat to pop, you know I cant pass sobriety

Im a total fucking joke, removed all references to the atomic family
Im a total fucking joke, removed all references to the atomic family
I still bring the Holocaust to an end
Every generation, they released more records than God has made in eight years

They even spread the disease

They even make ice cream

Haters usually dumb as brick twice his weight
So when a fan hits him, he usually HASHAPPEN
If he hadn't gone on a record let alone been covered in ice

He who punishes his prone opponents with stings has one shot at survival
Heater for medium loss, heavier for triumph
This variation on the breast smasher leads to greater party continues
Large for smartphone, 4G for EXO junkies
Try to talk smack and you could brick them from the future

I'm telling you, man, this song is so good, in fact, so amazing
That admit it, you honestly think you're worth a thousand words???

Meantime, much ado about no-harm pop, we kick ass

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Lipity making
