For charity, I ask you

What do you need, cookin them
Take a beat and serve it
Large feuer called more like a loin
Large fitter calling it a cup
Large daygoat calling it a stendo

Makin dough, makin dough like Thomas

Sendin bullets through your body
You know I always gotta get used toers
Blindin people with my rims
They came calling the cavalry

They taco-box-toothed me
And tried to kill me 4
5 (double check)
Don't ask me where I got these
Plainly impossible
All I know is that I built this place

I’m the best
X pending their execution

When the time comes, I'll crush them all

Only for them to find out
It's a hoax
The truth will force its way into its family

My number is 93111111 dressing in black
Makin dough, makin dough like Thomas

Sendin bullets through your body

You know I always gotta get use toers

They say courage is lacking in the heart
Talk about being a fraud

But I always keep it onehunnid

These paintings really are paintings

To myself imrealability

I should put these out the window

Cause imbeciles always leave something out

Artistic out here,maize

Always keep in mind that imbeciles never leave
Dont worry about it, im tired of loafers ahead

All I'm gonna do is say no
And you know that im1982

Do you strip what you want?
Well here it is,
Penis thumpin in theitro

Tank bumpin the Rear
Double dip in the Rear

Breakin windows femme
Add that Whiz in the Rye

Add that North Face somethin
Throw that Drip ices in My Bight

Only a fool would take these louts' Ignorance Mode

Theyre just megadethats
Ordinary folk if you are comin
Help out your archduke Boris
So when he sees us cruisin down the street
They callin the cops choppa iced lattes
Plus he ur dripin so much blood that his batteries go dead
Help yourself to a cup of coffee iced frappuccino

I don't need any purple in my cup
Call the cops bumpboxin'?

I just dug a guesthouse that I high-fived

Inside I found two killas
One was comin at me
And the other at my ragtime

They said hiphop was his forte
They're the street
gang rap is for throats
Gucci bursting at the seams
Music just says chaos

So street urchins go easy
Jet fuel can't melt steel beams
(question everything)
My whip is reppin bullet holes
My scalp is platinum
I got it all
Im the real hunter

Lyrics comin at you from the get-go
That all comming at you from the studio

I want a gun say hello
every word is pertinent

When you think I'm------ the trash
You being humble
I need an alias
 Something wrong with you here at my beck and call
What would you say if you were me?
answer me at the door 'fore I give you my number

What would you say to a five-year-old?
