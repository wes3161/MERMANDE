Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between your eyes
Finna boutta gonna have a drive-by
Tap the trigger twice and you die BANG

Versace Versace Versace
All these other rappers just copies of me
Run the game got the lock and the key
What you fakers need is a lobotomy

AYE that’s how we roll
Wasn’t raised a quitter so i'm never gonna fold
Everything iced got a toilet made of gold
Look at all these platinum plaques I have
They're for nothin but fiends

Just so ya know I live inside a mansion
Cuz the servants steal my tales

They even eat my breakfast

had a lie biassed on me so I cant talk

Made more humor than a paper clip
All these watches young man owned
He even took my wallet and put it inside his car
He that’s know less
He won't beat you unless you put your mind to it

Three eyes open and count"—large macaque’
Got that worn yarm cup on my wrist
Throw up and I'll pop you with my metal stick

When I see you guys growing old fast ’karma ’(ayy)
Bout 'at ol' yarm chain burn yo gang for your toy
Take a beat and fight ’retaliIIIight

Got that black leather vise leading me like a force
All these knockers make me sick
All these earplugs make me wanna sit on the subway

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
All these flip flops make me wanna pee
Soari da room let me -
Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

Hi there kids
My name is

Im coming here today
To tell you not snort coke

Just lask week
Some guy came to me
And told me how his brother died
From smoking PCP

I don't need any purple in my cup
Cause taking drugs makes you dumb like Forest Gump
Drug are illegal, and doing them is bad
And every
