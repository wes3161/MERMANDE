So I got my "Buy now, pay later" attitude
Got money better spent on the long run

What a shame we in the military are crap

Fake stories are fact
Family running amok
Fathers done talking
Try to take everything you have
And you just end up on the run
When something bad is about to come to pass
Then you know something sinister is about to hit
 with a pop
You may not find it as ritually heinous a crime as some would like
You may find that doing really well with your time
And you may even discover that you weren't a true person
You may find that indulging in life's trivial pleasures is a sin
While doing just that you may end up on the run
When something bad is about to befall you
Caused some of the famers to wane
Threaten the whole family
And now for the displeasers
Those that are good are we, the 1%, the 20 am
There and done we right
And crooked we live
We a just people

They (People) always ask me, "What are you doing here?"
There too my name is Cautioner
In case you don't already know, Cautioner is how I roll
I get so really bothered that I almost break my wrist
Plus, I keep getting asked out

So how come my guitars are always on the street

Shootin up the sunwalk

Covered me in a tarp
And then my publicists came
And told me what to think

Going without saying

As much gold as I can get my hands on
And now and then
