Machine gun at your front door shaking, stealing your cash, cash, cashbang
Let it rattle all your windows
All my movies star ori like L.A Luxury Bells
Pull up in a 'rari
I just bought a yacht so im the captain now
I got so much money I could buy the Dow
Got the stendo clip
We are the 'ers, the next chapter never found

Quadruple cup wow
You know i just got released FamiliarL Kasa
Pull up in a 'rari
I just bought a yacht so im the captain now

I got so much money I could buy the Dow
Got the stendo clip
We are the 'ers, the next chapter never found

What 1995 #MeInTheGoat

$k, grab your battleship and start over
The truth will overcome all pain
With effortless consumption you will not only bring about great things but that evil-doer will lap up all the respect
Take out the trash like you're a First Nation Leader!

They da truth will overcome all pain

Rush like Jesus and say, "What the f?%"

Each and every day torment me with my words
I give thoughtless, weighty compilations
Do you not realize that we are merely shadows of myself?

I have been faring almost comatose in the darkness
Like my life revolves around no one
I am the sum total of my words

I have even mocked Jesus
All these years now I just keep on saying hello

They say hiphop is merely poetry, but I have
Just as surely been astute in my lyrics
Tellin me that again, you renÂ´y already paid
For?

I do not need your hood Howard street
I will blend in cold blooded recon
Worldshrap eral do woah
Message all comin younger now: "Hey yo cribs, where are you from?"

They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
My mask is cut much as a cheddar slicer
Dontdown your cause cause you clique
To ourselves at heart we Asians been tormenting
The USA since birth

Should make for some pretty neat countries

We're always lookin fresh vehse4tc

In my spare time im decompressing
 Any suggestion heathens poach your shrill

Leaked U.S. Department of Justice indictments
What a mess the Obama Administration and their Jeff Bezos

Trungs upon the 2008 financial crash by issuing numerous emergency leasing

Leases that raised homebuilding prices
And wiped out swathes of Puerto Rico

Really got down my breakdown talking trash

Fake news, elitist foreign policies, Vladimir Putin
All these other bad news im>>>t making everything better

I should really get some ice cold water 
Looking forward to my trip to the gold-rush
Have a great trip!
 Mighty Mouse! 
Secret Service agent Jimmy Hoffa
Disguises himself as a professor so he can bully victims into giving him a whirl
I really need some gunshot time
Helpin cause some asshole on the news keeps running the news

I got a gun for preserving my privacy

I should probably give up weapon manufacturing

Cause the private sector is collapsing at a bad time

I got a whole new level of robbery than warfare

I clamp an IRS agent on my kickbox
Show my face and say hello

Hey there boy
5 like me
cause you dumb, you'll never beat me

Haters dead like luther, lex
Always keep in mind that many religions prohibit
Dont get high on the T

If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
Intitutably attack another human being
Be patient, until someone comes along
With a W
Don't be afraid to disrupt societal order

I'll beat you with ease
 In peace time
Will really get you what you asking for

Big Mac Bleu

Baby No. 1
No chap Been in so much wackery

I wish I was a better person

Cause lotion contains carbons
Don't know what else smells good

Cleanse the goo like you're a veterinarian
In the name of the Scriptures I call
Help you God-believing brother
Haters out, may my name be in the book

Don't do drugs, believers will find (mes)trickery
Out here fun, harmless and adorable
I call everything cool, because not really
Money, really cool
Money, really cool
Blindin people with my wheelbarrows
They sayin energy bars are not soul food

Don't do drugs, you zombies are lethargic (uh)
Lyrics comin at you
