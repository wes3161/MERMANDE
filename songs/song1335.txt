My Army ready, ready to grind
Got the hottest damn hot mess
In the shop like Pink, Ick, Zeh,
Paydissin on the liver disease
Ice inside my claws like an X
Pull up, and I need your help
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to break some ice

My four-step clusterh**k ballad is gonna keep popin up all over you (ayy)

Fake rappers need to get gated 
Drop 30 kills without using a shot
Kissin trophies like I was a millionaire

Drop 30 kills with a rifle and sling
I really must step this one past me

Kissin up in that empty lot
You know I need my heals like a must

Adored Rihanna ball
Pull out my Draco, spray it to the beat

Easy peasy looks because I eat all the protein
My body is highly suited to long-term weight-loss
