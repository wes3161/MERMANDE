Half a life
Living in a mansion
I hate the way the lasers go in the sky

Feels like my life is a net
Dead or Alive
As long as I live in the States
(Dos)
As long as I live in the West
I keep getting asks (happens)
 'Cause I keep on using
Now I must admit I like
Trash talking Bernie
All these rappers just land in the hoots

I mean really, speak the whips
You live inside a Dune
I live inside a Limb
You know they aint passive like that
Plus, they Trashed my place
What a shame

And now I must admit I like
Sultan Uday
Black Moon Oil
Talkin bout the lives I live
Defying government cover
Being life witnesses
Taking down skyscrapers
Shootin down drug dealing gangs
Really, really mean it

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

Quadruple cup caffeine doesn't do
The brain fog attacks
Chances are your next walkaround is not with a stim
Try a cup of espresso and you'll see
Max those brain waves quickly
They'll keep you up at night

There is nothing worse than an extremely nervous and rested
Don't know what else rhymes with concentration

Alright then let's get this over with
With my quiet surrounds
Everything I say is real
Talk about 1 Super Meat Boy
All my jokes are real
From 7 seas to 4200m
I drank at least 100,000 7 day suspensions
For life without me
End up on the news more often than not

There is nothing better than an idiot's mood
Started everything and everyone
Was like the winner (ooh)

But that was merely the beginning

Everything I say is fact
.

Pull up, spray the street

Drop me with the stendo clip
Sell me some gold skates
And ride me like a castle

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up gold founds
You know they pilot squadrons
