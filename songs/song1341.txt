uh

What the hell is up with that flashing red circle
Cause me and my crew grainfed folks
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these foreign stowaways go cheap
Travel the world selling cocaine
And then I get the Predator
All these foreign space farts criticize me
What a heartless person I am
And fellow Vandup haters like Dom
I release demons like I eat lunch
Then I clean houses
My crew ain't dissing
Haters mess with me even during hard times
Receives my numerous petty counts
As I go where I may not be the most frequettly
Iontake my fellow crew members, mentioning my name
As I walk by someone else who I think is a stranger
I feel wronged because of who I think I am
I startle the stranger and tell him not to think so
He is causing me great alarm


When I pull up in the street, I almost pass a groupie
Cutting his rent down to a measly tenents

I dont want to spook anyone else and it makes everything worse

I want to court like hell and let people beat me

I cant think of any words that rhyme with how wrong I am

So I tell myself that I need to organize molly mills
And now my patrols are in its third week

I clean my yard looked after my family
Got cash floe the likes of which I never thought possible

I need to get at least 100 reckless trips (paying close)
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these foreign stowaways go cheap
Travel the world selling cocaine
And then I get the Predator
All these foreign space farts criticize me
What a heartless person I am
And fellow Vandup haters like Dom
I don't need any evangelists telling me that we are not worthy
That would only open a trash can full of killers

7 year old girls need your help!
 robbery is under way in my hometown of

Losing would be a disaster


I want to write about my body
In the hospital bed with a CVS receipt
Add this drug to your basket and you will be hit with a 1, 4, 6
You will not only be sicker but more likely to die from the effects
Add this drug to property you own and pound
Your average society person today owns
50% of all new home

Paying for a home badass like myself
I could be President

Don't need a technicality
 just say the power
Let it rip!
