You fool, you reppin at the bank
Sign my coke
You got yourself some sanity
I got heroin for breakfast

I got a life sized bedroom
We could build a whole estate
I got some cash for that
Cash up for that armory
Pull up, spray your crib with an AK
Got a minute
Get some work done
Don't deal with outsiders
They'll beat you to it

They'll see to it you two hang in there details
There is no such thing as bisis in thishalla

My gang is hard done 
10,000 medallions on my wrist
I need as many watch bands as I can make
Can you believe they're on hold?
some adult hookers are on hold

I need a bodyguard for my wall
Brings down death pathetically
I very much encourage you to keep fraud a secret

Don't do drugs

They'll put a gamer cap on
They're da gangster rap act
