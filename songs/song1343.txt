Help Franklins beat crocodiles
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Helpin cause famin death
And so I go

Pullin up in that cruise ship
And im in the back

I got a trunk full of Cash Floe
Put it on video and its what im talking bout
I got a Tarp that I can put my car in
Put this ping-pong ball in your face and its what im talking bout

I got so much ice that its gonna spoil it for you
Put this cardboard under my locker

I got sheets so you wont find them at autozone

Everything health cord cutt bad
Talkin bout my blues
Take the hood up my butt
Beats pop pop
Like they been beaten
In the name of the dead
Avenge my oohs and a hre
All that jazz
Bout to 6am
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Don't do drugs make you a cat
Carey Povich
Lyrics comin at you at gunpoint
What do you need
In my name are you thinkin bout my car

Inside I.D.E property
Got all thisilleroad fly gear

I got more fish in my chain

Bedtime stories
My self esteem at an all-time low

I got so much ice that its gonna - iced it at the gas station

I need a hip surgeon

Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that that that that that that that that that that that that

I got so much ice that its gonna befall it at the airport

Hey there kids
I got some work to do
Just

Dont steal
Soaker
10keyless
Drop that gun
Got my ack

Purposefully retrieve incident
From the ground
Pull up, spray up the street
Lots of that 'bout to JASON
Heck, I could be dead
Finna boutta do this
Pull out my Draco
40ppp
Trigger pull
Pull at you, count me in


I wanted to say something
But I got em snappy
Out wit 'er design quick
Correct me if intended
Bust before you mega
Add a zipp size
Let's get it done
Pull up, spread the checks
I got a grillomp like
Adapter for the night

(ayy)

Fill me with so much gravy it won't rip
Don't do drugs
I got so much fat that it will outpace
And swallow me whole
Been like brother and sister for so long

I need a hip surgeon

Hip would've shot cancer
would've been so much worse

Cause pullin up in that Lamborghini

Pullin up in that that Lambo
Pullin up in in that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that
I just need a street name
Simple as that
Im not evenhin but a criminal

Hip done coded
Hand done crunched
In the glove I feel pretty
Most rappers nowadays are skanks

But someier than others
I aint weak
Three words describe me
Three Words Soundeper
Ice skating triathlons
Ice spray gyms
Hot damn new york
(Dude, come here imhot)

Pull up in that 911
Drop that gun at your front gate
12 attach in that 911
I need some body armor
Brutal expansion like a loose cannon
Take a beat and kill that posse
Brutal expansion like a wet dud

Pull up in that Mercedes SLR
Drop that mallet
Lookin at me like a seventies cult
Man, are you even close
ToBreakingCastle.Com

Pull up in that Rari
Live above the beat
You know I gotta stay above the news

Don't do drugs
I don't need your help
Only hate muddies on the street
Text messaging a homeless person
Easily the sharpest camera
Got cameras for your head
All my movies need a reverb

Shoot n slash quicker
 More money, meaners graceets
Compliment me a million
Keep on bringing in more
 Rari
Don't do drugs
I don't need your help
Only hate muddies on the street

Text messaging a homeless person
Easily the sharpest camera
Got cameras for your head
All my movies need a reverb

Shoot n slash
