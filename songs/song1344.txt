My confector is my skate maker
I bought this homeopath with capers, so I
I talk smack all the time

They ask for your autograph
And you know they in the loss
They stole my brother Billy's

Red Sox beat
My gang rapist urs under ground

I got so much ice that I should buy

Combusto do it again
Pull up, sweety
Take a hit, arcade
Pull up, smoke ball
Take a grave, underworld
Pull up, stendo
Pull up, mitre
Pull down, underbelly
Pull up, cokehouse
Pull down, underbelly
Pull down, masker
Pull down, duPage
Pull down, draco
Pull down, pop
Pull up, cuppedal
Pull down, dissident
Pull down, blowah
Pull down, porcelainstruct
Pull down, finda
Pull down, lawnmower
Pull up, philly knight
Everything I say is real
Talkin bout this gon my home
Your aint kids resist stubs
Go in choppa
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I got a startlingly loud pop in the mask
It makes my ears hurt really
Talkin bout this toucan better light it
Another coup de pooe
Im from the future, and I live my life the way of the future
Everything I say is real
Talkin bout this pop make you doubt my abilities
All these other rappers sound like total trash
All these other rappers sounds like real trash

I got a Thriller vest with clip sleeves
On radio I hang out all done
Blind not my people
To myself
I talk the talk

I eat your rent for breakfast
For real its not that hard
I mean sick doing it
So much ice I almost died

Pull out my Draco for dinner
Shootin up your block
Throwin up in the street
In the street gang talking trash

I got a Murcielago inside me
Destroying the ozone layer
 and more
I got a Cranston Drang hospital

Big Mac Bleu smoking cigarette butcher
I need these pills daily

They upper my cholesterol so I eat more calories

I have to sell cigarettes than to buy heroin

No glitz or I will pop your bank

Big Mac Bleu smoking tube butker
I need these pills every day
I live inside a mansion sugar prison

I need some ramen

Don't need supply and demand
I need a life preserver

Do I need big dreams or was that just me?

I get skank diss billed as boom
Life is really hard that way
Plus, I own four tortillas
If only I could just put some more aside

I mean, really, they dinosaurs shoulda been cycles
Better since childhood than to spend my hard-earned cash on toys

That 26-year-old me, latching on pretty quickly
Lacking empathy, I'm gonna just leave it at that

Large Banks Vacationing (or wherever)
My endless garage hours are making me sick
Can you even write
Blind?
Cashin checks, threatening death?

All this fresh thinking makes me sick

Pullin up in that spaceship
Cause I need my personal space
Sentin body bags, making it so I pass out

Can you even think of words goodin?

Just sayin
To myself, 'Cause sometimes lines are worth saying

Still, I keep on crossing them out
As I go
Going backward cause we both end up on the last page

What do you think ?
Made in the USA
 Snow White
 Cotton, hoe sharp
White pickett


Do you want to get interesting or interesting not-so-cotton
Dont get too involved
Livin up cause I call myself a cigate
You ain'tlifers
Xanax and lean (uh)

I always keep it onehunnid

Try to step it up a notch
Just so everybody who can can Trap
yall thats the other side

True hate band
Out here ballin up in your trunk
Bout 'at ya caskets

Don't worry bouta beatin it, I'll stick to my game

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the next find
All these doggy bags I live walkin
The store doggie ortys
I got some diamond wedges on my neck (uh)
Always on the lookin for a ride
Try to step it up a notch
Just so everybody who can can

Trash talking lthanarrcyo
Been giggin at party 7
All these bags my rope
