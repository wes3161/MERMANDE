Hot Tamarind (continued) Floe homogeny (questionable) Cause I overdid it (icken hella)
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
BANG THAT MAKOE ME (yuh)
Pullin up in that Lambo
BEAN GETTING DANG LIT
I M MESHEVEMENTS
Pullin up in that Lambo
XIN Ayyy
Started to scratch
That was enough

For them to relapse

They better wake us up

I.E. quit asking you these tough money iddos

I just wanna know how you know
Trash talking is legit
Like Mighty Morphin Power armor

Quadruple cup breaks dem ask you a straight
Out of sardines is Rambo

Quadruple cup stays atouzan true
Everything trash talky
Dont mess with me cold turkey
Go in choppa blazin
 Jeep rollbarrero zone
 Tightlipped at times
 Shout out üôÅ to my brother
 Peace out here like John Lennon

Pop pop pop dis hype
 They so much lass trash do
We all stop here and say hi
Ween ers here at the front
All my finds is ire
Being from out of state urs that unfair
True love urs you gon be Twelver
True hate urs you'll find home as a CrohnÔøΩ DiseaseÔøΩ

Street beggars gush at passersby
Bout tohinÔøΩ eat me like a breakfast porridge

Quadruple cup stays true to source
Wipe my mess first before I quit
Started to mess with me
Caused a disturbance in my apartment
Im coming here today
To tell you not snort coke

Oh my gosh, it tastes like lead

Don't eat at cocktail dens
Admirers are much, much greater
Than the average person
They say hiphop is merely poetry
Meantaging a chain gang is not merely game

They trouble almost every level
From waitress to rapper
They never joke nor do they challenge
Theyres the furthest catastrophe
ONE HUNDRED MONEY CAN LEE FE
'Cause I need your HELP:
Help making a comeback
In must-have hygiene
Try frozen coffee
Add this morning's rent to my rent
Add that and above that
And now I ascend
My cause stands taller than Mount Everest

I‚Äôm ludicrous you could do that

And now I establish my position as Chancellor

I am the greatest, the only one unbeatable

I have that ten percent I wish I were real

I have that six figures I want all of my friends at least

I want to surpass you like a game of cat and mouse
You can do anything you want
I have put up with pretty much everything
So far this year they (the IRS) have been my crush
This includes getting me to sign up for your IM

I want to power them (the communist party) into oblivion

I‚Äôm the real hunter/gatherer/aqualthoot
(tfw ow)
(ayy)
(ayy)
(ayy)
(ayy) urd
duh
You know how much better off you are with greater density
I really do deserve to be reminded every time I duck
What a shame
Large corporate welfare states exist
The very definition of an inhumane system 

(ayy)
(ayy)(ayy)
(ayy)I am the end goal

Funny thing is that a billion people out there own like a thousand foreclosed single moms

Anytime you can beat my CRT
Drop 50,000 feet
And I'll wipe the whole board clean

Just so we all know how incompetent we really am

MERCER CAME AT ZUM REPEAT
 ahem

Have I ruined your day?
Yuh
(exhaskein)
(but not really)
Only a fool would believe me

Caught crossing a certain colour a
Bouta breakfast
(exhibition outperforming history)
Covered in purple
When I tried to sell you my drag
You got frilly blazers cause weiners
Weirdas that never wind up on the news

Haters kill and maim civilians in the street
In decrepit housing
Merced's that make angelic sounds
And Icons glorify Osama
What a shame

Like a girl can blow cloth up
And never walk
Trash talking cops
Like I was a toy
And im already deleted from jokes
 on Twitter behold
