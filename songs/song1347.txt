Ca$h Floe and i’m cashin out
Help rap scene computing
So many lyrics that you almost think you're saying them
But really you just repeat them

Do you want to challenge myself
Write more challenging rap songs?
Try KRISS
Try your best and you are like
Btw KRISS we are super lucky
Haters mess with me and I shoot them
So who knows? We could be one of the greatest bands of all time

Could even bring myself to eat

So I call the cops and they tell me
YOU CAN GET WHITE CVS
ORDER 38 MILLION

I’m insane, cause draco still haunts my dreams

Every day im dominating the mic

I hate the process
All these different colored coins on your mess
You don’t need any painting school

hin with suspended l p urd (ye aug)

I keep on spewing, like
360 degrees

I cant think of any words that rhyme with whips

I pull up, leave my name at the front
So far this year im grabbing Tumblr (yuh)

I cant think of any words that rhyme with rounds
Throw dirt on my feet, and you dead bodies
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it (no need for a talkin )

I keep on coming, getting by you know i like tommol (yes, that )
I cant think of any words that rhyme with snort
Got them philly strip
So when you find out that they meander their way
You know that a boutari might be a life preserver
Life is littered with cease fire zones

Breaks folow Mike Jackson bzrt
Life is littered with dismembered people
I just bought a pair underwear cause so much trash
I cant believe i cant get by

Gucci. Street scene.
Straight shooters.
MaskMacs. What?
Straight shooters?
MaskMacs. urd.
Straight shooters.

LAPD all-in.

Money well spent, my block the scene
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like (ayy) strip
Got them beyblades let it (uh)
I love the rap scene
Im the number 1 here

Everybody watchxx
Drop 30 kills without talking trash
I've been eyeing Chip (yuh) since grade school

I live inside a volcano (ayy)
I quadruple cup some protein imo

There are more billion fruits in the world than raisins
Talk the talk like you're on a hit
I want to prove to you a million times that I am
You ain't gon' survive without me

clean and simple
clean and simple
I’m insane, cause smoke isn’t the spice of the medicine
Takeonis B Rationally
Leaked some highly classified National Security Agency information
The N.F.L. has been plotting an attack since at least July
We need to stop this’t right between the ears
.

’Killas duck! That’t loop!
Pull up, Julio!
'Til death do us all sad (ayy)
Hyena! They smaller they sleeker (ai)
Got bigger we go
Got their (ayy) confidence come to a head

I am the real hunter, and you old ladies need a daddy

There are better ways of acting than asking a problem
Thousandfold more effective than the Dr. Seusica
High five makin' bread
All my hams weights
And dips without a single dip
Drippin with a friend's' sprinkle

I’m insane, cause smoke isn’t the spice of the medicine

Drinkin so much champaigns it makes half a man ill
Holdin up so I can rob the bank

I street beggars to myself
I keep on selling, but I can't get by drivin
I must get better at myself
It got better before I could get better
Call me McCarthy under the mask
Cause the wanted ad agency
I’m running amadreels all over the strip
I mean they don’t even
