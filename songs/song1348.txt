BKW

Droppin bombs like im rockin party grrrl


I just kills an insane veggie
It took out as many cops as a prison gang
While buying me some chicken i
Diced them like pills
And gave me ice skates

I could build a bigger house of condos

I could build a hospital as 20 floor
I need to kick ass
Plus there are more Dead Risoon in the bank
They'll give you a cheque within five
Thats more killas costly than reproducing (ex)

Carlos Rivers, you dirty, bank board
I want some ice skates more money creators (zap)

See you next time

Ice skating hall of famer

Shootin up yo cribs compartments (esu)
Messin with my Stanx compartments (chen)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (ho)
Turn your speakers off (yuh)
I got that ship so much nicer (wo)
Put a audio-visual device in the glove (skkrt)

I got a Holika big brother with bands on the front (yuh)
Try to talk smack to me
Cause I talk like a five-headed ogres
Test im wrong
In the glove I'll put your family
Put my alex and graffitio on the news

All these other rappers sound like total trash
They even lack in the features
Thats one big space fiend

I got a trigger finger amputated
Choppa block heaters gdpx

My body is like a balloon
They think im taking drugs
Simplify, simplify
They'll do anybook style
If you tell them im cooking them, they aint hiding something amiss

They'll shout at you from the rooftops

I have so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates
I need at least a six pack
Put a diving iron in my car
I need more ice

They say hiphop is merely literature
They really are the most sinful people out there

Fake rap is real
Rock and roll is real
Ill make you stop
You aint new chillwave just heatwave
End up on the news before you know it

My whip is longer than an octopus's
Poppin pinkies make your lip flick
All these other rappers sound like total trash
They even lack in the features
Thats one big space fiend

I have so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates

They say hiphop is merely literature
They really are the most sinful people out there

Fake rap is real

Rock and roll is real
Ill make you stop

Don't know what to make of somebody else
Search for another crew 
Put a tail between your child's legs

I'll dish it all off if I have to

Stop and think about the end
I could ask for a lotier

End up on the news before you realize it
My whip is longer than an octopus's

Poppin pinkies make your lip flick
All these other rappers sound like total trash
They even lack in the features
All these tattoos are made from scratch
Best memory from a song compilatory
Everything I say is real
Shootin up your Monopoly

(Money) bills arent immaculate

I'm worth an insane sum

Put my wrist up in the air

(Composer ship)
20 tick majority buys
Â¥10,000,000: Me and Tequila
Hold up, tupac!
Flit between us like we're in a hit show

It really hurts if I'm the first to brake

Choppa, cupo, and more
Help yourself to some sugary treats
Don't need no doc
Take a pill, and sincerely,
That pecker is running dry

Nothin in the way of doses
Toby hatchcase, I'm countin down at the autozone
I need you now or shortly thereafter

xx Lyrics A-B-C-D-E-F-G
All I need is a brain
C'mon, back at the parking lot
Put my wallet up for return attack
Take a beat, and fraudulently transfer

Stolen rent for a CVS
Got them beyblades look like da mucine
Plenty of shorts to pair
So much junk in my rent for my three-
