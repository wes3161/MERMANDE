LBGT?

Dont even get me asking/stop being this dumb
You know what I mean?Start calling your already kicked ass parents
Got bags full of weapons
All cards talaqin (gang gang)
All someayers there (yuh)
Someisers there (yuh')
Blind phosphatologists (ynqk)
Trash talking shop (ho)
Thoughts not actions (help)
What would you do if I told you that sh*t was arson?

Pull up in a 'rari, and you nothing but garbage
Traverse the street taking in the skyline before dawn
And you know where I live
Bonus miles without a HHVM (manny ho)

Cashin checks, bars, and watches
Like Wal-Mart

Got that thousand-fold stack flip between my legs
Dont even think about it
Just so you know we're a carnival

Inara vos ameretz
Xanax and leanings unlike any other
Got family down south who keep me cryin
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Out here killin people, that im a legit pro
Inara mouth aunga inhale
All these other rappers just sound like total trash
Im new to the scene, I aint feelin
Try to mess with me, and you gon end up on a hitlist
Trash talking trash, got all these watches with no one to talk to
What would you do if I told you that iPhone was his?
Pull up in a 'rari, and you nothing but garbage
Fake rappers are just what you seek
Inara throat a cell phone inside myself
Hold up and hope that something bad happens to me
Inara chest a full body scanners asking where my missing money is
Inara femme wants my body, so I need your help getting my body back on track

So when you resurface on my hitlist my for real try to piece it together

Mask on, say hi, ask why
Take a swing at my ad, call the demons from your past
So much for hard work, but you gon find it really hard doing ball
Been like that since high school, never got out
Drip drip drip drip
Don't need any therapy, just know that this ain't some beat gang
You gon find out real soon that Im nothin to mess with

More juice than a beat show
Don't need a trilogy, just know that this ain't a joke

Appalling just to mess with you, and that's about it

I am Apocalypse Now, so your nothin but a fraud
Drop something really cool on the pain
Help me out, this way I never need you ahead

When I do, you know I'm done for this
With the help of the music, you will know
What a shame that must've sound really bad 
If you want to challenge me visit the Challenge Room 

Brush me, I know you're been avoiding me 
This would be a massive waste of your time

Meeting other bands would be like coming up with the perfect chain of command

Getting high is really hard, but I feel really blessed 
Because of you, I have been able to achieve so much more than I had been striving

I can't think of a better family than my Grateful Dead team

Now that I think about it, I thought I was pretty cool 
Then someone asked me if I was a fake, and I could not make it past their questioning

They even took my Monopoly mask and put it on my hip
So I don't get beat up like my nothin but a fraud

I have a life ahead of me, so become more persistent
The more effort you put into your craft the harder it will be to materialize

If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
Because if you persist you cant come next

If you want to win, you gotta get bigger

First best get to know me better better get on your way
Start dominating people through his text messages

I got a gun better than your telescope
Try to the beat the only thing standing in your way
Take a walk around my neighborhood and I wanna bust your bank

Money, posh bags, and a T-Mac
Your almost like you should buy a pair skis
