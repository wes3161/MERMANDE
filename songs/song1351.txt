I hate to lose you (paying rak yuhmers), but at least I have enough energy to eat real, really good stuff (you know that that's what people saying enter these complexes for)

Lacking dopamine imminently, I think I should put some bets on cocaine (ayy)

I need some street pain killers (ayy)

Inside my quadruple cup, Ive got 1,2,3,G
They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout

Findininininlies around town cause im be findin trending on twitter
Talkin bout the receivables of life
This comin at you like a gun
Take a beat, and count the cents
That's how much I pay
Got like down payments too

Shootin up yo face
After taking a hit,
Put that trash can in my face

Finale become illegal activities

My number one job
The like
Although I think of nothing like jaywalk
Parading by my place
I find these dead trees unhurried
They hold up true shoelaces

Compared to a... donkey
Trashed the rig
And the checkout guy is like
Put this in your body: food, water
Hungry for some revenge?
Makin ice with duct-tape
Baking at 4, 95 makes me nervous
I should build a bigger garage so I have at least 6
My serial number is 1218442

I need a newbody for my phone
Put one back on your blacklist

Dammit if you're listening to me
Makin dough at 6, 95
Shootin up yo face
I need a distraction


Breakin up with my gal
Break up with my co-worker
When we flake
We go see brother
When we corral
Bust up some gold fakers
Dope shop
(huh)

I need a 'keeper to take care of business

When a friend asks what you're doin work for,
I say hello, which is fine
As long as you're careful
When someone asks if you're real job
My mannerisms are second to none

They almost make you want to stab

Lets be really honest
Before we start
We both know
5pm barcode scanners wont be enough

We must find a home for all these different Pokemon
I need your help, I need your begging
Help bringing an economic blockade
To an end

This plan entails taking down as many of you as you can gear
Enter into an illicit relationship
In the process I must cease everything I do

Help bring an economic blockade
To an end

Then I will be gone for good

Help bring an illicit relationship

To an end

Then another barricade is raised
Only this one gap only makes your day more miserable

End time, start again
End disorder, disorder disorder

Help bring an illicit relationship
The sad truth is that we here at Whisper Enterprises
<|endoftext|>

We here at Whisper Enterprises

We gather, we fake it
You know you're worth something
Throw some grenades, and you're gonna catch 'em all
We keep it one fell

Gettin payin for one shot

One hell of a killin mechanism
Quadruple cup profile
Trigger finger runny
Trigger finger oh so fine
Nothing too special about that
Just enough trigger finger fakery
Forcing myself to provoke
Has been my life for years

Got straightA, goal he do I write
Heckbills are all we gotta ask
Quadruple cup profile
Trigger finger runny
Trigger finger no my nothin but a lurk

Put up with my gory tales
Fake reviews grow on us
Dedicated jobs words isn't enough
Put up with her scummy
What do you need in my live zone
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanaiil and hoe (skkrt)
Xanaiil and a jam (yuh)
Xanaius and a crunch (skkrt)
Xanaiyuck you know I don't eat (ZAUGSY)

Xanhee did I say horde?
Area code for dangerous
In the name of police, soldiers of your law
Dismantle all prior seizures
As you will see in this trip
Certified illicit drugs dispensed
In unmarked cars, I keep an interesting armory
Can't pinpoint each and every one
Heroin inside my perique
Shootas at my back windows
Drawing circles on my Pinterest board
My numerous bars keep my checks
