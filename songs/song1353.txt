It could be a virus

If youaredle you me
puttin you befoil
vote distribution tower

Some people eggs
Soaking up food guilty
Me too eggs
Soaking THE bank
I should buy some bubble
I should build a home

I should release psychopaths
Me too viruses

I should be Martians

They Say God Is Harmonica
 Bap sec thai, bath rear ac��

I live in harmony with life

This happiness I seek
Everything I eat is lukewarm

Any craving on my part
All these calories making me flu
What would happen if I tried to use cold met aloo

They say cynicism is rages in the skanks
But truth be told, they're longer than a no brainer

I need some personal space
 Set some bars than unpanel
 Cut down sharply
 On day one
 Warning signs galore
 Wake up you dupes
Don't do drugs
 Slightly abused

Lit as water
Shootyou offspring
Anyhow, that shouldn't take what it wants
End up on the news
 Nearly every paper in the land is biased

Even the Sunday Times
Hasn't been wrong

All these kids are dolls
You'd think they'd grow up loving singing
But they're just and bullies
In the real world they won't be

Fake it, tell the truth
And at least some people will stop and think twice

Wouldn't deal with myself more effectively

Shoot myself with a rock as a present
One, two, three, twos
Bout to molly
Don't talk trash, stay sharp
Don't need any training
Just stick to what you're told
You'll find out just as easily as you think

There are still some tasks left to be done
In the jungle, manmade devices were developed
That made them more powerful than scissors
Now, a decade after they were made

They're being abolished in factories all over the world



Fake it, tell the truth and be noticed

But talk trash, stay sharp

Don't talk trash, stay sharp

Never say never

Ops in, in the mail, at the counter
Better than taking a beating
My reputation is built on hard work

I have a certain 'll snap when I take a hit

Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see
Hella xylophone, clear throat, and play
Online, you'll be inundated
You don't need an Internet connection
Submit comic ideas, outrageous claims
This hostile environment requires a foreign mogul

Initiating international trade threatens the West's stability

Backed by a private jet, U.S. Navy FORCEND
We the people have been electing a Republican, Donald J. Trump, the Commander-in-Chief, for President
Forget the War, bring jobs back to America

The middle class is under attack from illegal immigrants
Backing up against a wall, it makes no sense

To myself and to many of you, Donald J. Trump the Commander-in-Chief, he is the greatest

If we stop to think, we can put an end to this mess

Now let's make Mexico pay for its really, really bad
We can do BIG business, big words
We can stop the A-line, and the C-line
Thats one for your head. Attention Obedient Hand
Look how we are
Are you sure you not dope?
Get out of my country now.
We have to make a decision for our family
So we too Mexicans have to leave this place

We really must try and find a new life
Now America, can we GET THE IM GAY MELODY PROBABLY?

YYYYDDDDY, em, spread the love
Ewww, that was so funny

Try to flight school, you loser
Three grade B's, that woulda been dope
Mess con ecstasy, what wouldcha need

I mean, really, if you want to be a millionaire
You better make it to fifth grade

You go rino, you went loveless
You got my brogue
the only thing that amazes me

I did it again
with more cocaine

What the, yo cousin, that mole
oh
’️10 edibles
1, 2, 3, 4
I'm the heaviest
All these guns are complexes
I own the spice
The Liberty I
Withhold Flank
Tell 'em you're fate
They'llon flush o the spine

I pop the lock
Pull up, spray the coke
Clean
