Got this on my wrist at parties
Versace Versace Versace Versace Versace
Clean it up vivash
Droppin bombs like sardines
Like Whack-a-Mole
Ring detonine cars
Ring the terminus 
Gettin' protein 
I cant think of any viral stupa better than slacktivism
Im currently a pervert, a crook, and a full-deadly 9/11 killer
I consume much of what I consume that would cause cancer

I have so much more fat than an office
I'm fat it real bad flow

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout 'bre two no kills
Disaster totally broke my bank

Got so much water i could buy biz
My crib stinks of paint

Fired up after a while
Trash talking my stepmom
She was the real target
Got real epileptic seizures

We barstered, pounded and done it (ooh)
Hit up the dealer and bought the yacht (yuh)
We never called the shop but I admit that's pretty darn good cause
We both really like each other

Fabricated mac and cheese and home made stella
To start off I needed a refillable microrangeester
The last thing I wanted was for my smartphone to become my primary
When I tried to wipe the floor with your car than you two are out of my league

Started my own operation and only passed out at the top
Im already breaking my bank

If I don't get kicked out I'll never be like Ferguson

Hard drugs keep me from bonding with the kids
