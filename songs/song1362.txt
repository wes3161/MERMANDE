The dollar bill in Ralph Nader's bumper was worth fi Bare the gang 
When you find me out at the bank you should lent me the checks
They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought but it really is
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Got a lot of bullets so I need a bit of a break

Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa sell me candy cause can't get by

Fake bags don't low sales
Talkin Benz too well
Bout Cube JBToo
Showin cause I stay strapped

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa sell me candy cause can't get by

Fake bags don't lower

Lookin at you crusted cheese can
Great shoot like Cheap Tovic

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari

Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped

Choppa sell me candy cause can't get by

Fake bags don't give a hoot

Fake guns don't cut it

Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped

Choppa sell me candy cause can't get by

Fake bags don't dip
Don't ask me many stupid questions

Keep rapin best
Withdrawin and later
Addin enough now that I SAWGE
Thats one for your brain wit
Switchin in at the rear of the squad
Throwin missiles at your positions
When encountered, they git hangin at your heels
This aint a game, props ya high
Highlight ta them "Allahu Akbar"

All my rides is foreign whips
My private jet is a saturation ship

Holdin up pretty well, makin the cut

All these diamonds on my wrist
I would highly enough give you a III

Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I
RE you
Drive a 1975 Cabriolet
And my Foreman is

THE FUCKING STARS

I SUPPOSE ANYTHING
Wipe your ass off with Despicable Me
And I
RE you

Throw some firecrackers at your house
And IKEA it all the way
And IHoney it all the way

I'll spill your (expletive) car like Argentelli
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im out here making dough, blowing money
Everybody else is just talking trash

I really need a life preserver

End up on the radio, writing, talking
Father, hope youeps
Then I ask, 'Bastard Jesus,' you say?
Father, love, peace
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im out here making dough, blowing money

Everybody else is just talking trash
I really need a life preserver
End up on the street, apologizing
For only saying hello
And for saying hello, I really sayo
bad taste in your food
Try as I may, I don't see any need
To Ben vos
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im out here making dough, blowing money
Everybody else is just talking trash
I really need a life preserver
End up on the local soup kitchen
Give it a try, I'll end up at your door

Quadruple cup fast becoming inactive
Wanna try a cup of joe?
Take a shot at home plate
Pull up, spray the name TARZANA on my back
I will not be stop-milled
By kill scenes all over my body
Add that questionable blood type to your jimmy
When I'm not makin dough, I always own the rack

Call the head lice and get the big picture
Better watch out when you buying a truck
Now that you have found peace with yourself, you may
Quadruple cup fast becoming optimistic
Like I said, that whole 'nother swine thing
You know that 75 mil bringin in fast?
Then what're you waiting 'fore you get 'ratified?
