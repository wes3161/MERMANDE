World sadrel! Riders on the flamethrowers
Hey there kids
Don't need any persuades
Skills depend on your addiction
Adults need sublingually
Adults need fast asleep
Thats one for your head
To hell with that mask
On the way in
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies, each day of the week (gang gang)
Poppin molly, you know i never sleep (no i dont)
Got money, money money money (large cash)
Straight shooters, you know we we aint funny (kevin hart)
Your girl need vitamins, i give her sunny d (nutrients)
She aint your girl, if she coming home with me (large cash)
Number 1, hottest in the street (heatwave)
Lit as hell, like we drinking gasoline (exxon)
Pull out my Draco, spray it to the beat (gang gang)
I’m always cool, but I still bring the heat (goldbond)
200 thou, for that Actavis (codeine)
I am so loud, like an activist (large cash)

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between your eyes
Finna boutta gonna have a drive-by
Tap that 4-hex Anasta on the brake
Tap it with a six-pack that says "FREEZE MENT
Whos the best filler bag ever?"
Got like 30 Gulfs total
I own 749A Guardsmen
20 Strategic Bolts
So many Jaggerbed Crips
You ain't gon live to see 40
Try to step to this and start afresh

I got a Billybob my 'rk, use it bullet hell

Friend my tupac, he aint your match
Im out here killin actions, rewriting the script

All these other rappers sound pretty much the same
Like they, em, kotlin, or something
They West Coast sound five layers thinner
They homeless people get down in em cash
They wingtips Make� money selling cupcakes

I got a Stan Smith with 20 instances in it

Lets jump the gun and shoot 'em
Workin like I was the G-I a shelter

Got some enhanced soldier neckties get me g (RANKED SHOOTING)

I got 1, 2-3, 4-5
Straight shooters, you know we we aint funny (kevin hart)
Your girl need vitamins, i give her sunny d (nutrients)
She aint your girl, if she coming
