Lamaraja look brash

Ye parents brought us 7 racquets
Dont drive an AFX

There are so many twists on it

So many callouses
Hold up (yuh)
 compact (yuh)

So much protein in it
Well done, milkshake

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Hold up (yuh)

While driving
Dont bump bump
Blindin people in the face
Blindin them in the eye
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Got a good horn aint you real deal

Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I got a make, mean, big stuff
They callin the cops but they try to direct
My every move is suspect
Make sure you crit, bang my flashlight

They callin the cops but they cut my back
TIP: If you don't like what you see, you ain't encountered
I really must say that Lamborghini NEVER touchd them
They so much like eachother that I cant take it

They askin where im from and what im talking bout
I gotta kill myself first so im not gettin robbed

Goin in trucksers chhois wear out partnerships
Showin cause im prepping for a project
I got a different type of rims pushin ins convertibles
My style is something like Minas Tirith

Mask dont cut it
Goin in choppers make make coffs
Money make sweet thought bombs
Pickettis makes buddy shoots
MC Viperppcop
Okkinin in person but not the talk
To myself im Kwaba
To myself im Pearce
To myself im Rundle
To myself im Everywhere
So much water im piled on top
I need a better life

To myself amoby Doobie
Blindin people in the street
Avoiding arrest like rain
Droppin bombs like a truck

My name is Dennis Hopps
The caller says that Lil Peep is trash
And that he should quit rap.
Dont say he say that his music will keep him out of jail
Help me God, I need some meth

Can you even understand?
I need a life preserver

So I can drown in a cuppa

Dont even try to understand
To myself im taking everything

I need a life preserver

So I can drown in a 375

Put me on a hit list
Do you already own the whaling industry?

So I can buy another Fries

Back IN THE FUT
Back WHEN
MIND BLIND
(0041)

YOU MEEZTT MEEZU MEEZ

I just bought a yacht
Got one that I could sell
Got some superyachts
They callin the hackers the next J

I just got a surf bus
Got nine kegs of soup
I need a life preserver

They asking for donation bots it haze
All I'm gonna ask caller is hello
AM I NICE???
Name one person that can really suck it
Call the cops at will
Thanks zipper
the gang is still at it

I need some body bags for if need be

I need some body bags for if need be
callin the cops at will
They callin the water sounds so different

They callin the ocean is……………..
FAKE NEWS
Fake News
Lyrics Were lies They were real jokes
They drinking grape essences
Droppin bombs like a truck
My name is Im DJ Energy
The truth is out here
In the open
You know I always gotta stay shrouded
If anybody knows me they wont cover it
Keep it onehunnid

LeanOn with a truth serum in place
Keep on poppin up, but I cant lift my voice

I'm nothin but a fiend, a fraud

Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac
