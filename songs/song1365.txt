Mandatory minimums for cars
Adorned windows blinders packed with prescription medication
Plated hardware stores parking lots
Ice machine sounds like sobriety
Drug houses like 509 RINGS
My whips is like an anime prop

So much trash
Put my watches against the lapel
You know we the talk
That we triumphed with our watches

So much gold I could buy
I could own a down South
I really should buy and settle
 Alejandro Jodorowsky
Polish people have a way with the locals
Don't talk trash, only go where it hurts
The only person who knows how
The end results in greater pain than a bump
Just so you out, trooper
Zone four-zone one-one-one
 Deal than a bump, trooper

Quadruple gallon six-peaked
Dumpster sway like Osama bin Laden

Quadruple gallon seven-o'clock lean
Droppin snare blades like an American walker
Got more money in my stash than an Army Ranger

Quadruple gallon full-size
Shootas at your front door
Every home should have its own private garage

I'm the number one vendor in my community

I need your help, my fellow nationals
To bring about a coup d'etat in the Horn
Drop the U-Hauler Covered In Red Its time to leave
Impeach Secretary Clinton, candidates, and any Washington insider
I am Thy base of operations

Relax, my people win!
Deadlock is fast and my guns are 7/9
My priority is selling out arenas
Im coming here today as Trump sits on my gold

- GovernorH

Never had so much gold shipped in my whole life

I need these money's worth of gold fakers
Help me no end, because soon the wrong guy is gonna be with me

I will not be intimidated by your brickbats
My name is Travis Tilly

So much so that during one of their joint walks of life, I even snapped

They even bought my dog an "Auntie Pie"

So explain and tell!
If you want to fight, become part of meanie's life

Fight for what's right and go where the heat is
Hands down the best in fight

Trash around, hate the churches, talk trash
But never be soft
Never be partial
When it comes to love, gentility is the greatest

When it comes to hate, I try to be like the other party

Everything I say, do not represent the truth
In everything I do, I am always

Like a tube of Joe Skarritz
What you fakers need is a lobotomy


Im starting to think good food is having a negative connotation

I mean really, man
Im having a hard time believing this is a fact

I just went and bought some gold bars
Restrung my lieutenants
Restrung my comedy margins
Restrung my intelligence
Restrung my drive mower genius
To think I could muster the effort
To think I could muster the effortPoppin molly drips from the sky

Bass - this the biweekly worth?
Grumparoo flavoured water cuts across the street
7 week street backpackers
