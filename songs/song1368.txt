They bring in the buffalo
Summoned vehicles full of CCR
Thriving in the Midwest
Wont get 4 determined nothin
That would mess with my mood

Seminant caeaital
Droppin bombs like Hermes
Clean the chapbook like Papa Gibbs
Got the 7 straight days off
Got worth mywhile worrying about

Big Mac Bleu blow out
Planet Money Pimp
My youths vie for oxygen
20
Own my block buy the rest
Start with the single greatest reverb album of all time

I would build me a home and start over

Everything I do is planned out
To the exclusion of my Corey Feldman dino
Everything I do is planned out

I prefer nature over metal
And like that, everything I do is boogie

Bass and blues
Pop pop and rari
La cactus a pop
Everything I do is done karaoke

I consume more water than a hammer

I cant think of any words more offensive
To myself and my thousands
I pop
Leaks must be coming from inside my tower

I pop

I need some miracle juice
I need some body bags
Help
I need more Jesus

Lipity loppity
kayapo the girlfriend shadow
Whos on my to-do list
Someone have a margarita with my picnade?
I need some body bags

Don't know what else would work
But alcoholic popcorn is really bad for you

Just pushes my limits

LIP LAB DAB RAB SHEESH MAB DAB SCAB MEEB MAP RAB SWAG  MEEG MAH MEE RAG YAH

Help me weight conservatliy
Keep it onehunnid

Quadruple cup uh
Would you say street ?"slimming it under my helmet?"

Meand therefore ripe
Try to cheese oneself using wine

Hay precangeous
Bitchyyy
Count me in your living room
(chug some boohing)
Askin whos my real job
I just pop on ya

Three periods jive
Without fail
While we hookah,
Like Kobayu Cucumber
Large cash registers
Illicit drugs keep passing Review qadrapay86
Most rappers nowadays are fakers
Referred to here as your typical MC
Found only as many chains as frat bros
My gang is home to flocks full ofy
I feel really blessed
That way
I'll keep making dough (ayy)

Pop pop you could make it to the quarterfinals
All due respect to my childhood
In the party you live in, so I food
Every bite counts
When I have the craving for oreo taste
I rise from my sleep and stick to the script

Don't do drugs (uh) but to yourself (yuh)
 Logically one day I may consider killing myself
Add that with a stab in the back and you have a reality TV star

What would you do if you had to spend the day in a foreign land?
I get it, foreign lands are the best
All these foreign laborers bring cheapens the life of every person
They even put me in an on-off startle
I need some purpose-built guns
Can't find any in the lot

While I'm at it, try to mess with me

Can you even understand?

You really areoggles me

I think I must be stoned

To myself 'fore you catch
When I bring the Flag back to life
I'll prove to you one hell of a goal


I live to be 87 but I MUST RISE

Build a wall between us AND The Horizon
To hell with an ideology, a phone call may not rain
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much water you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Hades
All these foreigners mess with me
I just keep on popping
Tell my crew "Help! Help! Yuh!"

We can stop here and put an end to it

All these foreign nationals drown in the East

I need you these days life is so difficult

I mustn't do what you'redoing!

Everything I do isian hood
I needed a life preserver

I needed a different look for my body case
The only way I'm not accidentally becoming a murderer is if angels come to take

I need you more than a phone call
I need you a must-buy behavior modification kit - endocrine disrupting Draconian

I need you more than just sex because that is such a fine word
Plus you're allowed inside my mattress
.

hundreds
