Three of my top ten single quotes
I always bring some for you to start laughing (yuh)

Fewer tragedies than a brotherly pact
Cause when you find out that another brother is coming for you
You start to worry that you're something different than the crew you are
But you soon realize that being brotherly isn't all that different than calling the cops

Another time or other you will hear me calling
What would you do if you had to walk in my shoes?
Every day in the life of a so called father
I will protect you and give you what you need
Everything I have for myself and my family
You must not underestimate that
