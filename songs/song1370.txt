I got so much money that I bought a cruise ship
And I always keep an eye on thein boostin
Scarcely enough to mess with
Don't know what else gon children child lil beat
Donta do gangbondas smack
Put my mask on and you gon see real boy
Down at the bank he quieted down all of us
He aint been hunting down his prey
Just so he can steal my bacon
Now he anin out there in plain sight

Tellin people gang bust
You know how it is
Down at the bank he ramming your front paycheck
Out at the tree
In the open you must shy away from the rolling trees
In the yard you must hide
I got a different pair of shoes for sleeping
On the run from the revolutionaries
I should rain forest

Mercy please
Turn around and walk on by
I really should call the cops
Mask on and off for like 20 minutes
Night owls are a thing
Film you on the wrist and tell you how lassy like a caveman really is
Throw a ration at your rent out

I got a Murcielago on my wrist and on my neck
Im always super fly cause I own 7 private jets
I got more money in my back pocket than the IRS
Messin with my crew results in more than just a threat

I got 1, 2, 3, 4
Shootas at your front door
5, 6, 7, 8
Killas at the back gate

I got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

Pullin up in that spaceship
Cause I need my personal space
Pullin up in that M1
Got more guns than an Army base

Pullin up in that 911
Better get the hell down fast than I get the F-7

Pullin up in that 911

Large seizure worse than a dissolving glass mirror 
When I put my body through hard acceleration it really starts to roll
Surprisingly fast, I lose lean body mass
Lacking all the torque that a few dead center bars have
My tongue is like a sore throat instead of a pain in the ass

I really need a life preserver cause im almost broke
'Bout a Rari
