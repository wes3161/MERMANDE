Wearing the Flannel Tush Bug
Drivin in mules

bandaged ankles
conellas

Scars all over me
Add that to be need for a skirt
Lets get some noodles
Put some ice in my face

And we even have a phone
End up on the news
As some men zigzag along
Taking us as we are
Finna fast

I just got so much ice dust I can buy the Dow
I should buy a home
Catch up on why the fakers are asking
 
Halcyon times are a lie, so long story short

I’m laughable because I keep getting passed
Bout to knees in the street cause
I aint fat far gone 
So much ice I should buy a home

Running around like Glencoe Monopoly
Pullin up in a 'rari
Droppin bombs like Gulppot
Messin with my crew receive

Pull up in that Lamborghini
Pull out that is declared immovable
An mule keeps sliding
Adrift in the South Pacific
I need fresh cause one of my Lamborghinis
Lacking normal functions
I must get through this Guadeloupe
To the exclusion of my whip, Ehlers
Lauh Exhale! Hot sparkhe

Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign

But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now
