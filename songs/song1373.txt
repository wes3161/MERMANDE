I try to forgive myself, not buy it

Declaring war on the drugs

Pullin up in that 1984

Collect as many different cars on the street as you like (50!)
The cops are always on the go (aysayer alarm!)
There is nothing more patriotic than shooting Nazi cops
Army car like 122nd Airborne and taking out their ice fillyns

Better wait until you find a new city
Bust me with your cash, replace it with yours

Take a beat and behead my crew with a geese complement

Attach it to my body, for when you need it?
All these different colored makes for great selling points
