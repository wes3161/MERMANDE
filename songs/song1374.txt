I got a mansion with all these jets
Just so I don't overdid it
I got bars of gold in my stash
Step inside my Jackson 4x4
There some folks at strip deal
You better hope not to go wrong

Mask on, boutta put these tigers back to business

Mask on, boutta put these men back to business

Mask on, boutta put these counties back to business
Mask on, boutta put these cities back to business
Mask on, boutta put these cuyotes back to business
I got a lot of reverb on my board
Cancelling the PC may slow things down

Than you would think so

Don't know what else Strom Thurmond would say
Project CARS sounds like a dream

Everything about it a dream
Everything else a dream

Haters dead like teh halcyon cash Cunningham

Battery strapped like Brian Wilson snapin
Charge phone, I just tap the button
And the battery goes straight to the draco

Pull up, spray the waste equivalent into the sky

Your life is a blur, like a 'rari

Franklins only take human figures
When death takes its toll
You start to earn over $200,000
Dumbbell bears make film jobs
Franklins only take human figures
When death takes its toll you know best that im out here making dough
Money ain't a feature, it's a magic touch
The only person who can beat me
The only person who can beat me
 BIG BANG BANG BANG

Mike the rep who bought all these Lamborghinis
They went lockidom with my voice

I got 12 Vendex barrels of oil
I need these cars for every job I get
I need these engines for my crank
I need those cranks bigger than their thighs

Need I mention that Im in the Top Earners Club ?

Better watch what you say, my ripoff gang
I need these body bags for everywhere 

Lacking biological evolution, I think myogen go

Really need that emissions cheating loophole

So much water in my system that I should build a lake

I need that to run my business

I need that for powering my garage

Pull out my Spare a thought
Make it rain like Marilyn Monroe

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene

Lets get this over with, im tired of your fakery
Im out here killing, testing, and messing with my Lilly Max
I got so much gold that I could buy the Dow
Got the stendo clip and chain D

I need a life preserver, warn dadine

Money, murder, sex, punk
I need these breathing cavities

Inside my own cute little world
We could build a mega-state

Mask on, boutta put these tigers back to business

Mask on, boutta put these counties back to business

Mask on, boutta put these cuyotes back to business

I get so much ice that I should buy a truck
Cancels all wildlife checks
I need a body bags for all my personal stuff
Disgusted sergeant parent tells me you can't do drugs on a case by case basis

I need a body bags for all my personal stuff

Disrespect __the name__ (no pun intended)
I'll give you a hundred fold
Fake doctors, don't treat them like bags
Hydrantips strip club autotune
Do you really need a beatestone?
Download MP3

Drop headphones in the snow and I'll send you straight to hell

Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to mess with
They much prefer us to them that nobody likes them
They single-handedly made me whole from scratch

I need two adult women so that I can raise my four kids

I'll give you about as much money as I can get
Send pizzas to grandma and orphans
Your rent a-kis on the street
Your rent is the lowest you've been
Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to mess with
They single-handedly made me whole from scratch

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let down
I need dye like in the bank

Shoot you with rock cans before you melt

Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu standing next to his brother Jehoshaphat
Bout to moo-hoot
Hey there kids
Don't need rims
Got a lot of 'erre serial killers on my wrist
Better
