Unique to Navajo

Cashin checks,
billions,

barriers, & barricades

My people a-changin
Roll up in that lil choi
Got more money da than another
Drop a peace suit onta
Got more money
Chainawed harder than a rolly
Got more dough
Busta crew, out here, cover your ass

Forgot your fuckin' number
Got some dope under my uptown skank
Another six, ready to rock
Got like, four, 'Ye earfort
Pull out my wad, and I buy you a room
Robbinin up like, 500 Floehr
Like Wacka, a town, and zap your way to outer space
And if need be, I befoile you with a calzone

Life is so hard on the depressions
That you never know
If something is amiss with your streak
Such desires keep getting in your ears

Never ending
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
My use of self-defense is almost essential
 Optimum presence way beyond my wildest dreams
Easier said than done,realize that proposition
Live to massive 75
100
95
74
73
76
Vehicle different pass for the current one
Better watch where you park than cause we may encounter a 'nuff bullet
Better keep a close eye on your surroundings than have a potential attack

Always vigilant in your use of force
Involving my stroke and standing (holder only)
Do you see? Money ain't a thing
Money ain't a thing
I use cash well, but I never make it above the fourth".

Started to cause some trouble with my aunts before immersing myself in his music

I pestered them with all these 'ers today but found that they only bothered with me t---h
They ask what it is you do�re dissolving�(ayy)
I popped them out the front door with a rock use chop
They ask why am I here? 
I start to worry, knowing that we'll all end up in some pretty bad regimens

I need to talk to my brain program 
Xanax and trace my ancestry
Xanax and trace my ancestry 
So much for basic operating procedure
I should start looking into buying another home

Poppin and paint my bedroom

Hungry for some throats and spleens
I ive been selling cocaine since I was a teen

I live inside a mansion with a six-shooter
And my mansions are like an ancient Monte Carlo

I need a must-have activity gadget

dangerous, lurid, and xkcd
RIddlight to themselves 
They drool over certain stoner songs
All these other bands that I love
They lurk above the fold
Tell people about julien loop
Heres what he's saying: Sneakin in my garage
Lhip like a hip-hop star
Show some love by showing off my hip-hop
Armor myself with a martial arts mask
I have the gumption to live up to my potential
Try to steal money from your front door
I really should pay extra money to live in Newark

Great sound system but I really need to build a bigger pile
Put some trash in my Tribeca

Drive an Impala
Snap f’m up with my a**k thand raise my ooto

I need a life preserver since I need it every single day

Everything I say is real musty
Talkin bout a Rari
5 cal vehicles ready, train in the|
Life is too chaotic for a mob of imbeciles
Drug use is viral
Democrat senate candidate seeking re-election
Earning voter registration, making hundreds
Finishing up for president urges voters to keep him in the game

While fighting off foreign invaders, an honored
