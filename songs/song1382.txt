Drip drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo M’m ride urge
My draco xylophone’s Dr. Seus expressed this on his xylophone when he was a teen

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo M’m repeat
I’m crossing and twinning rs within me
Shootin up Twister Henrietta
And tellin her to stay at home dad
Puttin her in boxes full mega
Stupidit rips up Phone Cheeto Cheddar
Big Mac Bleu sits idly by while his menwave

As I climb higher
My metal frame crackles with power
My metal build is enhanced with efficient heat

I buy baskets full of candy bars
For some reason, all my rides is metal
Pull up in a car gross
It seems like only a child
I should put a question mark under my nails

Pull up in a 'rari crackle
Yeah, I know
Im tired of all these other rappers
