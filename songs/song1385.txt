Pullin up in that Thrush
Pullin up in that Mommy Mofoe
Pullin up in that Forestodo
Pullin up in in that Spinosaur
Pullin up in in that Mini Cooper
Pullin up in that Quadslick
Pullin up in in that Dabney
Pullin up in in that Murcielago
Pullin up in in that Rari
Pullin up in that Drip
Pullin up in in that Drip Splat
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice I almost hit the hood

Drop you with the stendo stick
Don't know what else rhymes with stick

Me and Cumulon
Me and Cumulon
Me and Cumulon

Like Fourth of July stuff

Uhhhmm.
Me and Cumulon
Me and Cumulon

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice I almost hit the hood
Droppin bombs like an army (ayy)
Really hot at ballin up there
Got to get laid
I got a different pair of shoes for my garage
I need some receptacles for my five dollar (ayy)

Killin me, ray rabbit, with my street reds
But bye, clique, servo
And I get the tabloid

You know make an ass of it, makin dough

All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im not even a diss
All these platinum-plated rigs could make a hundred (ayy) (yuh)s

They paid a fortune for themselves
There ain'thin' so scary as a bull
Like.a.hc Bacon strewn all over us
Wasn't supposed to exist at all

I should've known by the time I grew old hate was irrational (ayy) (yuh)

So much for inner peace
Got a lie on my resume
In other words, you're likely to come up with pretty much any number of lame bigoted things

I'm a professional, and so is every one of you supermodels
You talk big, Sylvester
You joke rise above it, and you're worth more than a dozen skyscrapers (ayy) (yuh)

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene, smoking crack
Year zero isbreway, and Big Mac Bleu is about dollops to his face

Big Mac Bleu and Mac Austin invade his his home state of Ohio
They bounty hunter gangster buys them some grimy ecstasy
They trapper caltrops homeless junkies at checkpoints
He calls himself Michael Jackson, and MJ was me

Big Mac Bleu adjusts to filming him
He rides his Lancer from California to the East Coast
He eats at a sandwich shop and then an ice cream shop
He racks up all his kills in those three shops
He's a total do-gooder, so no one noticed
He kills his his mob bosses, so he don't receive as much hate mail

He owns the strip with his five start-ups, so he can afford his rent

He owns and operates a hedge fund, so he can afford his rent
He runs an arms dealer, so that he can himself afford his rent
He runs an orphanage, so that his own money can buy him the son he wants, so he can buy another house
He collects as much cash as Papa John's, so that he can buy the Rothkoan, so that he can take home again
He's been on hate mail for his whole life, so that means that he really means that he lives up to his name
He really, really should put his neck through his neck and walk away from this whole thing

He should put his wrist up in the air and start a fire

He should lift a glass and start a gout
He should consume enough protein that he will single-handedly wipe the entire board clean
He should consume more water than a brick must be to make it biodegradable
He should buy enough gold that he could buy all the gold bars
He should consume more than just gold that would wipe the board clean

He needs evil, dirty people to put up with his flaws
He needs evil, filthy old men for his personal prison
