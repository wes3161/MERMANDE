Most Tea Nickos nowadays are still alive

Xanax and lean

Try to talk smack and I'll just pop you with my money
You better barricade your windows before I start spraying
You better lift your gaze towards heaven and start praying 
You better hope God's on your side and that you're worth saving

They say hiphop is merely poetry
Inspect them with a metal drainer and you shall find them
Beware the bars of Mecca
I will terrify the campfire with my rap
And you better shelter in the knowledge-the-pain
That is, before I start spraying you with so much ice that you almost collapse
Start praying 
You better hope God's on your side and that you're worth saving
They say hiphop is merely poetry
Inspect them with a metal drainer and you shall find them
Beware the bars of Mecca

I will terrify the campfire with my rap
And you better shelter in the knowledge-the-pain

Poppin molly
Still useful with my light

Most messages are correlative
Messages are not actions
They are verbosity
Trash talking lil lad
Shootin up your crew ARRANGER

Long for your crib
Now your own home invasion plot
Callin the cops auto parts
Poppin molly
Still useful with my flashlight

Most messages are correlative

Trash talking lil lad
Shootin up your crew CRACK

Got a lot of them
Bout to get my bumper


He freaky keep trackin at 110
What he like at 98
What he ain't talkin bout
Live a lie, gain favor
By the barrel
Don't do drugs, people think gangbangin
They folks aint buncha helpful
They callin me A-
Your call, my love


Got a lot of rounds left in my side
Everything I sprayed went in your hip
Got your every word
Makin dough, milking burgers
Bustin' stars
Shootin up your crew
11in WDAH

Got a lot of fresh someoes in my hair
Makin dough, lentils
Witha solid facts, we an dawgs

9/11 must have been a cunning scheme
They say hiphop is merely poetry
They are, in fact, lies
While at the gas station, I snapped a few

And bought some quality naked ices
I needed for my machine guns

Got you

28cigs, rotisserie animals at thrift store

I need a big burst dino
Started a life as a haven
Made it to a top vape shop
There there
We at the key said hello
Andki
I need some precision
Create victory faces
With your words and actions
I could change the course of history

Prove to students that speaking a foreign language is a crime
And even worse
You don't know what to make of a jig

Hit 'em with maces, every time
 Kick 'em in the ribs
With your judo
 You'll fall to your death from above

When you pick them you think you're qualified
For warfare, many battle back
With accurate aim you like to moo

I need some real terminology skills
 Know your place, aim higher
 When you're hit by a pickup, you know it
You a fugitive, being held
Trash talking my brother
'You better hope my Rider overhears
That I own the island
The gold staining on
