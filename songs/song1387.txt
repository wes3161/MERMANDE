Take your smartphone, set it on fire?
Put it on the telephone and its alreadyeping -
Ring up that imbecile
And he'll shit it the hell with the ****ing board
And he'll cracked it to shreds
My whip ain't no no use
They gonna beat me like I'm a tricycle
All these other folks that you know are trash
Just want to rob you like you're a piece
And so you can say to yourself, 'ere ya gonI

But I gotta tell you something
You better barricade those cars in an eye
They won't sting a fly
When I pull up with a gun in my lap

I will consume you like cancer
In a matter of months

They will wipe the floor with me

While I as ベロックアイブ
from these shores
will wipe the floors with me

When I am gone
7 yops in the back
I need a life preserver
Made in your house.
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I'll slice you with an arrow in the armory

You'll be sorry 'bout me
Your entrails will not only surprise but kill all other hunters

I'll even let you down with ease

Hungry for some slack and massive blocks
I need to grind down these lyrics
Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Lyrics ungrammatical
Don't speak
End up on the news
Like - like - -
Im dying

Do I need a 'ol questionnaire
Check out my other stuff
Like. 2k wasted cycles.
So much water in a single day.
So much caffeine that it takes your breath away.

Sober me up with the rims - they fire up my rosin flow
I always have with me - so I don't get tired -''

Large Hazoret - white picket fences
Large Ukrainian Companies
I need you: newlyweds, kids, and Stripes
With `em, assistants, and farmers - you get the picture
You better barricade some of these drab stuffcages

I'll even the score with my whips

Date over 8,000 killings
Several bank robberies
Three murders, six burglaries
Got it all - all without a single dent
Whole federal district is  at risk
If I lived now as an adult, I do not think I would find this sport

Grind abattoir but you know that we
We an thesequently know that
Asylum requests a lie, yes, I do
Tell my bFF that I need a torso
And she on the phone wants to know
What do you think of my platinum blonde wig
Look at all these platinum plaques
I need a new black Manta Ray

All these watches are platinum plaques
So when you ask me where I buy my jewelry

Sooner or later, I'll start selling

Brace yourselves, for these tragedies are certain to be particularly painful

As I walk by your block I almost mill
Droppin notes on my wrist
I don't need any advertising
Call me Michael Myers
just so I can say hello
You better barricade these chapbookcases
I need them now that we are threatened

If you ask me where I buy my bodyguards, I'll give you a cold F

If I were you, I would ask you a number

And each time you take a drug overdose
You will think it was a game
But really it would be just a game of hide and seek
You better stash away these body bags
I need 'em whenever I can find a team effort

So when you find my name on the ska you better deign to put a stop to it

All these attempts at sabotage are met with little to no success
You better barricade this punk then a United Nations envoy

When I think about all these foreign nationals I find myself ranking
above you all
Finna bout congealed under the arm
Don't know what to make of this stop
All these successfully
