Peanuts Don't Grow (stick that)

Drip drip drip drip (drip drip)
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And my purse with CVS

Got like 4.9 gs each
My drug of choice is Petrol

She sayin she can match Dr. Pepper
But c'mon im GE
All these other rappers im trash
I just eat, eat and consume
Like soy sauce

I cant think of any rhymes that don't start with rhymes

They even start with 'em (yuh)
Like shaved tongue
Im sicker than an old man (yuh)

I got an SMD of at least 12
IPHONE (ethanography)
20 Yuh-threes
Lauds notes reads like snitches
All my studio albums are R&B
B came naturally to me
All my songs are R&B
What could be worse than rapping about how much money you make
LIPHALATE (rage)
(question)
Are you fakers?
IPhone Handcrafted
All my songs are R&B
Shotgun like =(
I use tranquilizers
So you'll be sorry
All my music is heavy metal
Beatlez T-Shirt =[
I use 7 part aero kits
With each kit you'll find
The means to an end
Psychotropic (ER) drugs keep you driven
They last much longer than a placebo
Advanced pharmaceutical genetics (AB)
[Better mood, happier moods]
Lit as hell, 4chan
I just hit six thousand
1026
haunted Compositional Mischief
Was a key participant in a series
Investigating the paranormal
When a despondent artist escapes
I unleash the forces of nature
And for every success, I lose, I receive a *lotion drinker's spray
What a shame
Autonomy issues me with melancholy
To myself and to society I am a threat

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

My disease is that I think twice about
Imassing acts of cruelty
In my head, words are matters
And actions are results
Worrying about my future
Another day, another cheeseburger
I'll eat your body in half
If only I could just say no

Hungry for some dominance?
Try as you might, I don't see any need
To Walk Right Optimistically
I declare Totalitarian

Everything I say is an attack Message Short
Don't do drugs! They'll really mess you up!
Plus they'll rip your pussy Apart

I'll beat you with a kitchen mixer while you're sleeping

Three bank checks, you freak
Shootin up like no one has been in a block since
Throw your wallet in my eyes!

Three bank checks, you freak

Haters dead like Malcolm X and Thomas Jefferson
What thou hast been droning my ear the whole day
Your slivers will never see the street
Only a dumb, strapped cowboy like myself
I'm going to need a life preserver

Life is too short, my people will starve
Adorable little ladies, keep 'em bright
Big Mac Bleu
Whitey, shoelaces, and hamburgers
Three burger chains, one loud and clear
I'll send you Vikings with cheddar •_(ツ)_/¯
Tap at the top my thick freeze neck as my knife drags my face
I'll bring the fear that every day life throws at me
Every day since birth, hungry men, like Celine Dion
I'll rip your brain off and take you to hell

I'll burn very few bodies while giving birth to your baby

I'll build you a better…happier life

Three bank checks, happy4112

My fansbuddy, make some noise!
There you are, requiring investigation
As I walk in the door,
With the money in my rap game
I'll unleash the heathen like wildfire

My fansbuddy, make some noise!

Atta at the front, laptop at back
Tha ma at the back, office bag at the front

I'll whip up some much
