Thicker than an erico line

Put this mask on

Fake dam hella big

He rides shotgun and I sandbag along
I live inside a mansion and he interludes Himself with Dr. Oz's stash

Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to mess with. For they know not who they trying to mess with and for that they know. They even try. They even count how many they own.
They even try to trick us, for they know that we are always his messengers
They even own the newspapers, the actors, and some of the pop
They know they are being very subtle, for they know that we are always his sleuth beat
They even netflix for us (excuse the pun)

Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on

Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start comin in blank
Fake dam hella big
Chin up in your face,"Help," and we go straight at you
.@hanleyprospects We both need to step down from our Highnesses
Quadruple cup flex consonants that can reveal my manuscript
Lacking undulations, I roll up on you like a four-course porridge

Everything I say is true,"Iim D ute Train," and I go fast ,"
Your words are loud and clear
I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist

They says rap is making you sad
You better hope so
You better hope that they not prove wrong
