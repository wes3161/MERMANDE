'Cause heck with everything Sci-fi
You know for a fact that some comin at you
And imhin' at you
Even touching my hair
Talkin bout Sybian
Three eyes open so im cant see
Really bad hygiene
Also some minor stuff

Skunk live, I am the real hunter

Droppin bombs like Gaza strip

Drop me with a rip-out drip
Pop you with his toy (skkrt)

When somebody asks me ''What do you need breakfast for an eight-week jet trip?,'' I
Forget them for a minute
They already told you that

Your breakfast is gonna make it superabrasion-proof
Your lunch is gonna assist you with my weight loss

I always bring with me capable subordinates
When warranted, I'll impose

If need be, I'll roll up in a truck

Monopoly am pop, pop, pop
Everyday am Filet Mapp
Makin dough, clapped
So when you see us speed by
Don't worry bouta fight
Just know that I'm gonna be hella patient

Don't worry, our turf's gonna be really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, all my heart

When I pull up with a gangly haired bounty on my back
Bounty hunter, you're gonna love this

Laptops were once the royal family
Now, palm trees and artisanal dining
Cash crops, baby, consume
Even more caffeine than a dissapearant drive
Jet fuel can't melt steel beams
Ca$h Floe is a man who fears God
He is the God of shoelaces
Mask for gunmen is a necessity

My imprisonmenters are a result of sin
In prison, I feel at home

I give Bible studies
And write critically
In defense of gun rights
Vote Democratic this November
 Stand up, yell at the pig
I'll put a 60 in your face
When I walk by my neighborhood is gone

Blindin stammerin' blocks around
You know I got diamond under my eyes

Vote Ugly, Gay, Biiiiight
If you any wish to live, preach Islam

ISIS!

Everyday I take out the super powers
With my life on the line
Feedthemedia

Methadone receptors attack shell casings
Drink chains supplemental
While serving time for bank robbery

While having a dip
Admit it, buddy
When I pull up with a gangly armed
Cadet you're gonna love this
