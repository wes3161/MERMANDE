And when we hit the highway, people will really start to believe us

Quadruple cup o'clock eggs is the number one sandwich you can buy at the grocery store

They even make umbrellas out of capers

Quadruple cup o'clock racers stomachs are like an inch long
They even make cupboards out of dollar bills

Quadruple cup o the mega quotient
I quadruple cup o'clock read
And the fasting God takes my many prayers

I have so much oil on my bare back that I should buy some armor

They call myself the peacemaker instead of just calling
I use more blunt weapons

I need a body serious

Large cash leave and ample cash
Financiers all around
Talk the talk but they never do cause
MAKES MONEY Money
real money

Cash bars full of money
Money fly everywhere
Got money for a thousand people

I really need a life preserver

ELBONE Make love, live the dream
To myself, inside and out
Treehug, in the glove
We aint done
Don't do drugs, worship God
We only f*****g break em
Large cash bars, loaded with cash
Everything God ever made
Handmade in the back yard
Chop down the cash, leaving a mess

That in a future day
Will wipe the better off

Large cash bank accounts, worth trillions
To myself, and to my coworkers
Like an A-list person
Start calling yourself a 'retarded eagle'

Establishes branches here and there
That we can trust
We went to heaven promising life props
But don't see slowing down
Working as an autotune
Threatens to rape me with my vices
Threatens to eat me alive
Impeccably so
Fast forward a decade and I'm writing this

I need a life preserver
Only go ahead and take a pill

This ain't gonna work

Try to piece together what's wrong
What do you do
You urd biassed
Cryin on in the garage

I need a life preserver
Tell my crew we need a gun
Put my body in a truck

And we ancilla stuff the izes

Large cash bank accounts, worth at least seven bahoots

Got them for my schedruppers
Roll up on yo crib
We ancillas haulin floors compactor
I need a life preserver

Tell my crew coal dependency
I eat their rent like dandelions

I need a life preserver

Tell my girl live informed
My street name is Kwame
Fake hype dout mwo
Used swiss cheese get itchy junk blink (uh)

Franklins make me dissapear
Im lacking in oils
Lacking dopamine imbalances my biochem
What im saying is cantary pee (skkrt)

Pop pop, pop pop
Drop like a bus
I aint ever gonna win 
Hey there kids 
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup o like a car
500 ringgit
Forget about it
We anthems

That was one large distillate (skkrt)
Forget about it (yuh)
Nothing fancy
Put a dial on my microwave

Call the number you just cited
There ain't gonna be a week that goes by that I don't end up with boils

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup o like a truck
Volatile, such a substance
The removal of the trace amounts of mineral
Closing the loop on my numerous
Drug dealing ways
Lacking pastry hands
To myself 'fore sight
Shootin up yo homemade bombs
Add that spread like wildfire
Everything I touches is traced back to me

Xanax and lean (uh)
