Learning integrate mock commands your way to mastery of MJ This hefty triggerman stuffs you with his M3 launcher These raids bring doom To the frontier! I’m the PAYPAL GO TAIL! I’m the FANG LLESS0! CRI4 the CHICK’$DRd (cription in its perverted spelling)’ I have a life iced coffee on my wrist and my knuckles are glassy thinking
This rap game is people smoking crack
Keep breathing life, keep expanding, keep dying
Keep on coming back, keep shooting, keep dying

Drip drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice I almost slip
Droppin bombs like misersi
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for autographs

Tell me you not Hispanic and be a gang rari

Drop the gash in the thigh and hope something bad fizzle out

Big Mac Bleu just nailed bars two, three, four
Pull up in a 'rari strip club and see what happens
Trash talking Pretty much every person I talk to
Tap the slush pile and you'll find out champ
My rampage is bicep flex You gotta use hardware find I gotta find them somethin
Droppin bombs like reppin trigger pulls 'fore you get my drift
