And miss your chance to outwit
Most crimes are lahars
Advertise as a man and you're likely to get prosecuted

But to really stand a chance, you must bring some cash
A stolen car keeps my gang at gunpoint
I keep up the assault with a 9mm
There and gone forever

I start to think twice about immersing myself
 in so much illegal activity
I almost went to hell trying to steal
Luckily for me, when I
