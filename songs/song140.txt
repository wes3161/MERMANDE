I hate the rap game but I still make in the addi-zone

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some revenge on my crew
I finally got the hang of myself
I got a new personality all of 'em's a-OK

Quadruple cup zone insanity
Try to talk smack and you gon end up on a hitlist
Trash talking my clique is like your asking for a death wish
You gon find out real soon that Im nothin to mess with

causeima W-H-I-T-E-middleclass g
And ima fill you with more holes than a slice of swiss cheese
Break up with the hospital and its a miracle its not a bloody mess

Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to mess with. We out here mobbin, whole lotta gang stuff, ya know?
They aint ready for us. They need to find peace with themselves 'fore they find me pullin out my piece
Appearoos, makin compilations, composing dirges Every so often, I come across your web site, makin pop
Check it out, pop

Ring ring a-a-daree
I been hiding in the attic since before dawn

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Take a beat, and steal somebody else's flow
But they gon bump it cause the cover say its cash floe
Drive a lambo, glovebox full of bands
Dont drive a toyota because its made in japan
Downtown, people asking bout my cheddar
Brush em off, I dont deal with no beggars
Gettin paid, you know that im legit
Drivin on the wrong side like im a Brit
Cashin checks, my crib is like a castle
Like Spongbob, you live inside a pineapple
Covered in red, tellin people its just paint
Another fake gangtsa out here dead, I aint

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's
