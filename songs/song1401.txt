Trying to put on 40 lbs of weight
Pull up in that Lamborghini
Pull up in that Lambo
Pull up in that black Benz
Pull up in in that white Ghost
Don't deal with a cent dong
I just sold you,
It just so happens,
That Lambo
Every day im running out
In the gamut
Myplasm
Ipad

Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades keep an eye on the subway

I got a lot of watches a boy banged a lot of cars
I need a life preserver

Soap shoot like dragon spray
Helpin you with chores
Take a beat and be cut
End up on a killing rampage
Ooh my door is on fire

And my roommate is comin in like I need a lift
I just got a new dharma instrument
Got a lot of reverb
Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades keep an eye on the subway

I got a lot of watches a boy banged a lot of cars

I need a life preserver

Soap shoot like crystal ball
Live your dream, God willing
Forget your fears, for the coming days will be crazier than any other
You'll hear the beat of a different side
You'll realize that life is just a game
You may even realize you're not a homogeny eater
You may even realize you're a fraud
Don't be fooled, for one day you and I may get together and live
As one people, for another day you'll live longer

You may even realize you're a fraud

Don't be fooled, for one day you and I may get together and live

As one team, for another day you and I may go to war

Break up anything between us like the intestinal tracts
And you may even realize you're a fraud

Don't be fooled, for one day you and I may find peace
As one body, for another day you'll live longer

You may even realize you're a fraud

You may even realize that you're a fraud
Don't be fooled, for one day you and I may find peace

As one mind, for another day you'll find peace

You may even realize you're a fraud

You may even realize that you're a fraud
Disrespect all as long as you can imagine theming us
Evil does not exist in this day & age
Imprisoned in a castle since birth
Imprisoned since birth

Everything I say has an echo out in my head
Everything I say is real
Fake news is real
 Jihad is really just the act
To myself I say "What the?", cause as a grown adult I find it really difficult to distinguish true and obviously anti-Muslim
To myself I say "What the fakers say really says "What the fakers say, really do true " 
To myself I say "Whatchu thinkin? ," im blockin aroundoid

When you think about it, im what im barricading my way right here in your face

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Makin some dough
Adding ice to cold beer

Peter Jackson and Holy Cross
Gently caressing Jackson and Pope
Asking him all sorts of questions
From where is he? How is he doing?
Im faking it
Tell me something nice
Put some paper up in a box
Let it go

Trash talking cops and junkies
Most of my activity involves havin dirty little hands

I really need some vitamin D

White people have more trouble controlling blood sugar
Than that
Birds donger
Than that
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?

Cuz I'll never touch your fatty face

Don't do drugs
Im number one
Don't do drugs
Don't do drugs

Ikiller zombie
Large purse
Disrespectful person
Don't do drugs
Im number one
Do you ever want to go to the beach?
Try getting some good air
Three days a week, go big-cheap
For a long time I didn't think I'd find my mind's eye
But I do now, and I don't go dark

When I do, I'll cross the finish line
Thank you very much
For stopping by my door
