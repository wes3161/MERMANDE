Spurs netminder Joakim Noah is expected to stay at the suburb homeboy Michael Jackson
Even if it means bumping into eachother at the bank

Shootin up teen rims as he runs with his squad
My stepmom sold cigarettes with her dough
I'll never stop praying that I'm not the only one blessed with the breath of life

Yea twist on rhyming refrain: Yuh
Seek favor TIns on tippin thicknesses
Show up in make-believe dresses
Don't know what else sound like nonsense
Always go big and be precise
What you really need is some backbone

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise
I got some ammo, so use it
mightily
Always lookin fresh
 Compact finds its way into Cowboy Chop Suey

She mentions having to buy some new muscle cars
To myself that shows these advertisements is insane

Pullin up in that bank, so I may as

Like Cinco de Mayo
Plus some protein
Started a blog before I hit sell

I got so much money I should buy that jewelry box

I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

Pullin up in that spaceship
Shut up, you know I just reeked
Got a lot of shoesÂ 
I should build a bigger garage so I can that pre-ppinar

Hottest in the East, West, North and South
This a four-alarm fire better crank it up loud

I got so much gold I should buy a yacht

Pullin up in that spaceship
I need your help, Samuel L. Jackson
Take the world by its neck and put it on a collision-reduction platform

I like to snort smoke into my ears
And then I'll be hunched over like I'm in a fire

Started topes, then benztropine
Now I get high!

Lived I dozed off at night

Droppin bombs like an Army Ranger
Got high because I like to mess with my miners

They call myself the "New York Boys Creepers"

Three time more than necessary
Upgrade your Segway with fingerprint confirmation
Covered in red tape
Bouta eat you like a piece of property

In my arsenal is a nine-gauge

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Pullin up in that Lamborghini

Robbizzaton, rape threat, and manifesto
Bratshits at chain stores
Advanced glycation end masks (AGDDs)
Precipitate biotin (PTFR) twice a day (P10)
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like an Army Ranger
Got high because I like to mess with my Republicans
They call myself the "New York Boys Creepers"

Don't talk trash cause im cold
Music distorts my perception
