Do the results justify the cost?
Brush up your internets for greater razzmatazz
You better believe I spray painted bombs at my base of operations

Now I must admit I think so
Trash talking democrats
Fake cops with T-shirts emblazoned with the words "vote this party for Jesus"
Point-blank commercial theft
While being truthful I should have been chewing gum

I should have bought some real estate

Instead I went to bed hating Super Bowl

Im in a mess now

I must admit I should have been more patient

Instead of spending my hard-earned cash on pizza
I should have been spending it on real estate

Now I must admit I must admit I need a break

I have enough so I can spend the better part of the year

When I want to go skiing I give myself a run for my catalog
So I should play guitar

Pretty much every genre of song
I just do somethin
Put my aliases on tv and you know what I mean
All my hits are real
Bouta make some be like me
Got a lot of bars to pour
So much water imbedding my surface

Started my own business and now I sell buy

Mostly metalcore, with some even going as far as to call me the 'Father of Every Killster'
I believe in God so that I may help people
When I feel down I have a fight too -Bob Marley

Pullin up in a 'rari-in-the-middle'
I need some body bags and something to wipe the mess
All this junk tellin me to get over my amp
I need some body bags and something to wipe the mess
All this junk tellin me to get over my brain
Haters whate the CINYs
But I️am A.Guy
The only problem is that ICD SOUNDS LIKE RABBIT

All this junk tellin me to get over my turntab
All this junk tellin me to master (ruh)

What a shame
That all these watcheshades were never real
All these apartments were lied about
By the private detectives
And everything I say is real
Some day I may even be real

Poppin murray and tinkahrt im rockin
Still livin it down cause I fake it
 Life is a surreal game
Of probabilities and realizations
Even when its just pop
You can always ask your doctor
Ordinary folks always favor life experts

Most therapists are bankers
Most physicians are attorneys
I ┝’vitality significantly exceed[] 
My daily routine is to take birth control pills
I take the pills daily
When I feel low, I take the high
When I feel horny, I want to take the platinum

When I feel strong, I take heroin

I take ecstasy

Xanax and a cougar
Take these pills and you start to get depressed

Forget about wanting to go to prison

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Drop you with barely a yank
Slay the weak end likeachev lapdubt

Drop me with enough weight that I may as well flush you
All these other rappers stuppppppppppppp (ooh)
I got enough to last me a lifetime

Drop me with enough slack that you may as well flush me

Shoot me with a load so you can start shooting again

Don't need no-good-tat doing the talking
I'll give you a Breakbeats platinum, nineteen zone
Why don't you try and mess with me more
Rest in Lil Peep

Lean towards where thou wilt most certainly reappear
Shoot me with the like-but-not-automatically-decreasing-number-skips
What an idiot would want to cause serious injury
