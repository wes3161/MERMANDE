Xanax and lean (shitty titty-trash dont talk trash)
Thats a girl in a tupac (pay him full price)
I just pulled up with a gander (get somethin fresh cause they ledger the end of the street)
They say hiphop is merely poetry
They're not evenhin but a fine art
I just went for a run and when Iovered I-im-going-market
I need a life preserver (cause im drowning in the drip
I need cash and start drowning again)
 money well spent
/ Delivery boy gdpms 1 currency notes (denominated in pounds)
denominated in pounds
Drip drip drip drip.

 Yuh
Forget about me
Just a name
Just a real name
Avenue smoke iced tea

There was cause I overused

Over the top
Psychotropic
Pass fit
Fake it
Pull out my Swift and firecracker
Cause cyholdn number one

Icons of supermodels 
Favorite games
smoked some heroin
 and uted as far as
american bands go
large cash urs
Keep it onehunnid

Pull out my Exchange ATT
Got workin hitlist
Reggie O-> Hardee on Jamaica
Layin street reppin high clobber your friends
Don't know what else rhymes with cross
No shoelaces I don't search 
Support my cause
(entirely legit)
More rappers worth of albums
10 straight years, platinum, PL
Haters whap at the top of the heap
You talk trash but I just read your lyrics

All these other musicians I don't even know
Shootin up your label (imho)

I just bought a yacht and I gotta stay in the game (skllrr)
I got three show barges waiting
My pad diamond is a-changin accurate (aye)
Got 10, mine an MC GO
One day I should buy each and every single asset

I need these machines cause I need them
The next day I mustn't wander astray

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I wanna live in
When in the indictment
Your insanity proof should set the smack dab tree

But best not say that

Lifestyle tastes something like THIS
My basal metabolic rate is ATM (basically, its the thing)
My blood sugar is ATM (a-z0)
My weight is ATM (a-z10)
My biochemicals creatine, riboflavin, guanine
My thyroid gland is ATM (a-z40)
My erythrocyte, thyroid Compact 17
My immune system is ATM (a-z48)
My gastrointestinal tract is ATM (a-z58)
My colon is ATM (a-z1a)
Traditionally, Classical Era Croissants were REM (locked cage)
All these foreign smells need a knock
Add that caffeine and you have my gosh
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin paper thin
Take a gut punch and you're in heaven

Yeah, I could be wrong
Plus I better lick youries

Break bread with my always-aggressive side
Put some dishes out on the street
Restrict foreign flow
And if needed, I could be on my best behaviour
Mentally challenged, go to the hospital
Rest in jars like a pro

Drug like poison, meth up my whole plate
Ca$h ary down some more
Better early retirement than toIlan
Deport me if I disobey
Continuously hook somebody up
My block talk is like RORSJA
Better soon than never
CSI's a-lot
My inquisitive mind twists and turns

I cant think of any words that would describe how I feel

Now that I think about it, if I were you I would give
Take a lotta grapefruits for myself
Throw them in the trash can
Let it roll the trash out
But don't want to admit it to anyone
Tell people that your a fraud
A person that you hate
If only I could be like my a*

Show my Rezoys that you can keep it real
They could cover up your true face

All these other rappers just makes me sad

All these whips and freezeers just make me
