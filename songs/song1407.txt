There I was at work, now that I think of it, the future looks pretty grim

Hurry up and spray down on the 'ers
They could really eat you if you keep pouring

I mean, look at all these platinum plaques
I should put that KGB on my wrist

All these watches are so imbeciles they must be been made in the '60s


Pull out my Draco, spray it to the beat
I go look in the mirror and I start laughing

I really need a whiz to scare the bank
Cuz im having none of it fun

So I pull up in that Lamborghini
Pull out my Draco, spray it to the beat
I don't need any talking
Just need some blow-by-blow

I live inside a mansion, and I built myself a home supercenter
So when somebody shows up at my front door, I stay well away
Then we can talk pretty much anywhere :D

Only at strip clubs and strip clubs a ca$hort like Sublime Cazor Get some cash By the door you know that this some kind of a trap 
Plus I keep my paycheck 
Yeah I spread drugs too :P

You think you're worth money? Put some coins in your hat 
And that way you know that its not your lack of that

Got 'em beyblades let it rip
Hungry for some throats and spleens?

Got like a 40 millimeter cannon in my molly
You know I stay on my word
Thanks a hell of a lot for telling me you need to keep
You know I chain bring the good news
Thats five (sellable) UHS cards in my trunk

Used ta leak like soy sauce
If you want the truth, tell the truth
Everything I say is real
And im legit
Don't need a PR man than are his cameras
So best not be thinking about it

If at a bar up ahead you are met with crowd

Should never be named like that
Don't understand
Talk the talk is how I should be

Make love in a flash and I'll blast
And shoot you with a spray can
When you see me showering
Pull up to you and say hi
