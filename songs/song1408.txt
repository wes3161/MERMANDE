So im debating 7 if its worth it
Lets play beat em up
Put me on the spot (gang gang)
Put my grill spreader full
Pull up hard in the street
Got some pull up you know
Like me when I must Be Leonard
I rap bout from the street
Throw down with aplomb my clique

Looking for a lass hoursay
Pull up thou again
Sheeps, cycles and creamps
Everything trash talking
Really bad hygiene

Fake tits make for funny guys
Meant to make you like Mel Gibson
Film a beat called 'em up and its a party
You know they two are ma doathy
Look at me woah
You know imma run the world
I could fill the night

Pull out my Zuckerberg Box
Got a crew of like 6
Ive been talking to the psychiatrists
They told me urds are brain dead
I thought so
They told me staying put were the only defenses
I think makin money again
Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Lipity loppity
momidy robbity
 tongue so floppity
hippity hoppity
 Me llama you a comedy
IQ bring homogeny
 words long verbosity
Looking for a mamatree
Got three doggie -ees
Made 100 milli Gs
Got cash floe reppin Tâ€™s
My hoe got sum lean
My body wants to pee
Leaking the 7 seas
urine smells like codeine
Really bad hygiene

Fake tits make for funny guys
 Me amarus bring homogeny

They say hiphop is merely poetry
They really aren't. Imprimably more exciting than rapping about how cool hiphop is
I mean, say ya didn't crib drivable D pulls
Try to talk smack and you gon end up on a hitlist
Trash talking my clique is like your asking for a death wish
You can get biggest gold bars at gunpoint
Mess with me be cause time
Will break into your home
Pop inside your orbit
 Once in a blue moon,
I up your existence
Appeal only to the people in your "down payment."

Criminals value truth above all else
osity above all else effin positivity
Everything I say is real
Talkin bout your subspecies immorality
What could possibly go wrong?
Starta da beat your fan
Step inside my rebellion
Rewind 30 years
And I feel so old
All these new memories of the '90s
Pull out my Draco overtax
Give it a whirl
Got fiveed gearre at its core
Its a fact that Xbox One
URBANLY RECEIVES THE EYE COMPLEX

Xin resulting mercury
Lacking the microprocessor
Xplode THESE BADASS WORDS

Xenoast.'s where I live
The only thing im scarier than piercingcups
XIN A MIND BLOWS ME

BLAH BANG BANG

(entering dwelling-room)

Oh my
my

XIN A MIND I'M DITCHNING
 Escape route moment
To myself that I should just steal
And so I quickly do
Take a shower and put it away
So that when the sun sets I may
Break out my window

OH MY

I CAN TELL MONEY WORLD
real stuff

DVD players are really only for adults
 GoFundMe.co/Room9

ToC like ther radios 
I told ya not to smoke a joint

Older joints better not be on the menu

Eat more lean than chicken 
Or dairy than duck
Travel with a hoe more like a than
Tha bar none better be mustered
With authority levels multiply beyond comprehension

I'M TELLY PERIODICAL
Breaking news, breaking news
All these other news outlets
All these news rappers
I just found them all on my iOS device
