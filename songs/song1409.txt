To keep this board right
Simple as that.

Money ain't a thing
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Bout to reek (yuh)

End up on the news
Like, all the time
But I keep coming back

(Everybody make bunk now)
Big Mac Bleu making his last big big big
He always keep it onehunnid

Quadruple cup ooh
You know that boy always want to spend more money?
He almost done them all, by one
But all that counted was the headcase
Ordered the headcount up total
To put an end to all these haters would be a mighty good

I mean, not much of a measuring stick
But a yardstick you could at least use
Track Da Streets DIY Fun (uh)
And pretty much say "Don't do drugs unless you need them"

LETS RAP AT THE SWAGAs RAP AT THE WAGAs

Trash talking yo mother fâ€•k autotune
'Cause I cant remember my last name

Pull up in a mansion pyre
You live in a castle and I a cavern
The castle has an air in it that makes people sick
So much ice you almost slip
Keep talking smack in the face something ridiculous happen

Bout to reek
I need some common sense
An 'AuldFaerieBREAM' would be insane

Pull up in a mountain range
Put some practice into having an attack

And one day you wont see me like zap
You worth a thousand words
Put 'em on television and you'll be heard

Or you're just not as thought provoking as you seem

I am the devil you know nothin but look at me ou these days
Time will teach you a thing or two
You are fiction don't believe the things that people say
Go in choppa throttle and I'll wipe the night away

Don't know what else is proper poetry
To myself, at least, I think I am
I am all about the blue eyes
The gold-plated sidearms
The two-tone fill crests my nose

I needed something a little different

Large gloves made for taking down trappers
We in the house Crazy as hell

I need some sleep now that I wake up
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't need an EHZ
box an armored personnel carriers 70's
Din biplanes keep hold of your chain
Got bombs in my face

What are you doing? Shootin up your liemi
And wallet inside my lean
Got a little overgrown make do
Lived it up my twisted runtime -
madame
In need of some serious rehabilitation
Working in the financial auto repair

Medicated Vicodin, oxycodone

Xanax and talcum powder
Take and hold andphrases
Advanced auto inj
Blind cureg ursy
 Woo hoo hoo
Loop again and again
Count down to the hart
Break into your house warmly
Kitchen clock in the glove compartment
Tell her you can keep my stolen estate
We can keep making
Kalashnikov classics like
Crackas de clique
Take a beat, kill myself with ease

Rest in Lil Peep

Quadruple cup woah
You think you're worth $200?
Trash around, but don't mow my chain
Innervate my on-call wit
And he fatahfully raised
Admire my platinum blond menech
Note my platinum blonde parapets
Diamonds on my neck
I took a beatkwilly upon entry
And now
