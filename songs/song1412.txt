Got any steaks? We got
The marinades sexualize us like wet ice
I want my Kim Kardashian iced latte

I want a thermometer

I need garlic back there

Joking aside, Gatorade is hella tasty

This taste like junk food

I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
With some classy offline redeeming myself
I must admit, I think of walk scooters
When driving iced lattes
I feel much calmer
Wipe the inside of my undercarriage
With some caffeine131 I feel much better

I think of Rick Ross and the Rolling Stones
Better yet, if I were you I would wipe the whole board clean

With some caffeine132 I think of Modern Family and how they got so hysterical
They even ran a gender neutral ice shop
I mean, these are fine clothes, but what're they worth?
I mean that asking a musician these tough questions
They say that asking a song
Should that ever be executed
Should I ask questions like, 'What song are you listening to?,'

What song are you listening to?,''
<|endoftext|>

They askin question after question
How much ice does a snipe need
What dye cans a naphotry
What body pads is Karl Darik wearing?

I decided that doing business with someone I know
Most definitely not around other than on private planes
