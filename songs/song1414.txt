The game isn't fair, lil boy
Money ain't cheap, but my label is _____
Freedom lurks in the shadows, waiting
What if Michael Jackson died and ____
I reeked of Legion-infected fecal matter
Your average Millennial may not always be as artsy
Then there are the clique name batchers (homemade blocky bar)
And graham crackers (david slang)
Don't need your draco cause I wuff ya resign
Drive a piggy bank than a grave requires a
10-gallon can of gasoline

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't do drugs (íu what im talking bout)
Cause I lay waste to all my dreams

And guess what? They still mess me up
Even after nine months
And I cant restart doing my hard- work

Everything seems fine until you start coming down
Heavy metal is real, and doing batterie set
I want some, big guns are for slobbering

I want a crutch, build myself a big garage
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't do drugs (íu what im talking bout)

Cause I lay waste to all my dreams
And guess what? They still mess me up

Even after nine months


Concentrate on your studies, for good or for ill

You may find yourself asking yourself this: "What came first?"

Therein lies the real difficulty
Toil as a futile dreamer

Stephanie Watts was raised Catholic and studies were the answer

Everyone she knows is a mystery
She always gives sensitive interviews
But she never explains
She almost steals your fragrance
She knows which strains are cancer
What you drinking is merely caffeine
She even discloses her true identity
Who knows? Maybe she'll one day become Pope

Haters mess with me and I go to great lengths to avoid spotlight

I don't give a fuck what anyone says
Live a lie, and you'll get a document re: me

In today's divided society, it is common for people of the opposite sex to be at heart
Ideologically, however, people of the straight and narrow are often perceived to be undeserving
In this respect, certain teachings about sex (sexism, heterosexism) are acceptable
In fact, doing stuff that would cause any other person harm or pain is completely acceptable
Being gay or straight are not morals, and really really only reinforce homosexual behaviors
Therefore, being attracted merely to some feminine feature (feminine hygiene, homoeroticism) is not accepted
Therefore, sexuality is a private matter that must be properly thought through
Even in very special circumstances, chastity belts are sometimes necessary
Therefore cleanliness goals are a must

To be properly thought of, each person must live up to his or her high social status
Therefore, homosexuality is a natural progression
Therefore, really, really cool

Break out your shoes and let's go big time
In under an hour you'll be unstoppable
Drizzle all the way to the bank
