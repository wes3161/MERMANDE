I got two Big Macs, one for myself and my crew
Caught up in a reverb

Got a host of other assorted counts
Hungry for some oysters, I got
 a van full of TAAs

Got some cutters, and some package people
And a while back I found myself asking myself
What the hell is next?
If you ask me in the street, I'm going to take you

Another challenge, my friend,'cause I always end up somewhere...
