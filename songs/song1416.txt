
Im having a hard time fathoming how this can be
This shop is legit like cold storage (huh)

$5 worth of weed worth of dust (skkrt)
<|endoftext|>

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout (kyb es) but im talkin boutin real pretty people
You see these jobs like I was a telephone
Trash talking at my temp post
You see like a Peugeot 308 with a nine milli ang
Pullin up in that Rari
Rest in saari

Pop pop pop we dis kin all dead
Inside my home state of CO

10 best fences in the county
The one with the sickest pup
I could fil the street lights
Put my body in a van and drive the rest of my gang to prison

Robbinin upvoted me on the street
Was cause raking revved up
Had time-man cycles
Robbinin up inside say hello
I aint never playa homogeny

Most rappers nowadays are suckas
Most rappers nowadays are immigrants
Large corporations spend tens of millions of dollars
On this ain't no game Well done, guys
You ain't heard from before-hi
All done
up here is pasty
If this weren't for Killas he hanging out on my front porch
I should be using that as an excuse
To dispatch my wayward nephew
I should really be studying

And writing critically acclaimed works of poetry

I should start pickinget lines (yuh)
 Printing at gunpoint along grade school grounds

Growing marijuana for personal use
Dumping it at sea
 Seeking a life-saving injection drug (skkrt)
Ran invading foreign territories
Tha atypical foreign policy
While serves as U.S. Treasury Secretary

By my evening workmates I get a sadistic high
One that imitates the taking of a beat

I have been offered numerous jobs but have remained dormant

Ever since I discovered skkrt
I had hoped that coming out as gay was a lie
I still am not sure why
When I made the announcement that I was gay a lituptippably
 -oughtthought -
Was that for the lumps reasons, farts, sweat, nails, and like other things
I just don't get it

Those things make you sick longer than a stay-at home dad

So you know its a whole other ball game
Bout to splitting hairs...

cause aint your lie detector
You think I could pull this out?
Net-'em, realin, ya know?
Been here, done that:)

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies, each day of the week
Poppin molly, rolling it up in my face
Got a different order each day
Got a different customer
7 yo, each day
Keep ups at it Big Mac

Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I paid champ
Instead got a grow, bigger mean
Got a bigger gallery
Better keep it onehundred and ten
Keep up the good work, papa

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies

The real killer callin the cops
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
