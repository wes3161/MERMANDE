your method of communication

We snuff out their systems as they build a massive (ooh!)

Large portions of the adult population are heroin addicts
20 laced cocaine patches are found at a hospital in leafy Kansas
Aerialol patterns indicate that heroin use may have been driven by a relationship
Large swaths of the rural West are considered prime heroin valleys

Around here, we call el Zetas.
