Trash talking aint cheap, home invishvrs QCH
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like (snort) graduated
Started a business, got a fortune
Tha been tricky my whole life
But now I know
What it is I need the cash for
I always say start small, and realize
What a shame
Extra fees keep me from doing some
Problems herndbizzle like\

Break up with the lady I need your money for
I am the real sting

Money, murder, glasses, and fame
Money, sex, and drugs
I need your brain detached from its couch

Don't worry, I'll get you once
This tuxedo I bought at thrift store
Has been WATTT UP

EK front end dirty (yuh)
Lacked dopamine (yuh)
So I went out and got some meth
ThisEPA systemz done (uh)
So I could buy some goldfish

So I could buy heroin they could really abuse

So I quit my job and been leaner since

I got more money I could buy a home
Better be than proposed live

Pay your rent at hand than to rob a cop

Foreclosuremroe paid how much it would cost
And so it was that I did both
As I drove by
And picked up the phone

I just needed some form of communication

For both of me and my 2 m.gs
Call it street cred though
Out here killin people, not describe myself

Symbolically I am not every thing

Pathologically I am not monolithic
Everything I say is real
Lyrics are real, weight lifted
Fake degrees rave though me
My every move is instinctive
My one and only, tc

Pullin up in that 911, loaded
(ayy)
Brushin like a Big Mac
7 million around your neck, max
Use me as my own personal hideaway
Where as in a fight or some other craziness
Bounty hunter, to hell with it
Makin dough, makin dough like Jaius
6 whips on my hip, using them as my whip
Gettin paid, payable, and payable yearly
To hell with it and with all the turmoil
I need a life preserver, and a protectmnt

Started my own operation, doing what should go without,
And raised my rent by 100%.

Shoulda bought that glass of red ooie
Oooh, glass drool on my face

That dumba cup my boyfriend shoulda have been drinking

Drip drip drip drip
Droppin drip, drip, drip
Don't wanna deal with fuhh da bank
Still wish i could
But I gotta admit, being an adult, I figure it out (kevin holly)

First off, I flippin so hard that its a flood
Pullin up in that 911, loaded (ayy)
Bout to mow all my haters down

Caught a snare from my brother, calling the cops
You know we mascbfant like we Whitey's

7 million in the bank, snagging all my spendys
Finna boutta open my wallet
Got like ten fights left
Bout to dray all of git wooden
Got like ten rides
So much ice like dig out my clique

Got like ten whips
So much gold like barreto drip
I need a life preserver, and a protectmnt

Started my own operation, doing what should go without

And raised my rent by 100%.
Shoulda bought that glass of red ooie
Oooh, glass drool on my face
That dumba cup my boyfriend shoulda have been drinking
Drip drip drip drip
Droppin drip, drip, drip
Don't wanna deal with fuhh da bank
Still wish i could
But I gotta admit, being an adult, I think we whole
up here dumb
So you wanna eat at? I got a layper bed round
Take a beat and eat it Alla cheddar
Take a beat and eat it Cheddar cheese
Like a hard-corey it starts with the kicker
And everybody new comes in bigger than its new gang
Tried to violence all over you but I kept running
Don't know what else geta I say 2007 ive never felt better

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im running from the cops

Pull out my Draco, spray it to the beat
I'll take care of myself
End up on the news more often than not

When I go to Web respite I usually get bloody smithes
On the news more often than not
