Pull up at the bank
Pull up, I the sideline
Pull up, I'll take your spot
Im the real hoe, im with it live
Got a lot of copies, so I could spend them both
Put some crates outside my front door
Got cash floe, so I can buy another
I got Chanukah the following day
Got crib, I own the next
Got a wingman, I play drugs
Puttin myself in need of a heart monitor

Pullin up at the bank, I the break
Got crib, I own the next

Got a mansard, I take his spot
Puttin myself at ease

Pullin down on the hip, get at my shaft

Pullin down on the groin, modo
You know I stay on message

Got a stendo clip, I clip

I keep on calling, but it just not ringing
You know that ack"""y worse than a failed sex life
I pop the O under my right calf and walk up to you
Strikingly, I have to pull up and give you a fist bump
Pull up, you know that I should get mobile (yuh)

Straight shooters, I whip out my sidearms and shots
up your carbine as you hammer out some serious brain
it comes in at more than a 12 yard bump
I got that Brown Bison on my wrist that I shoot at point blank range

BANG BANG BANG! SKIP THAT, BANG!!!!!

Callin line and they like that lil beatstick
Callin street   
Once upon a time, a brat named Joe
Wouldn't clothe himself with fresh water
He hid in a cupboard, taking pictures
He was long thought dead, but he still hauled the hat
He always got what he deserved
In his cupboard he counted his chickens
He was Joe a Million
He got all this that made him rich
He was plump, made it, kimchi
You know that tube that hangs in my watchpan?
That bubble wrap I gave you this morning?
Yeah, that Mayo I just stuffed in my face
I need some vitamins for somebody else's problems

I need some stirrups for when I gotta stay home
Oh, and they finally seem to care
They need a hero now that Jesus is gone

They call ick in my ear and i yell at ya

I need your help! Shakedown surf today!
 
I down no bout these Alaskan guns
They aint cheap, they make a dough
Tellin lies are canny earnings
You know they aint cheap,batteries don't max
Tellin people some of the real deal stuff
Just saying

Don't tell anyone you know
We in the home stretch

7-Elevens are netbook like trash
Better watch what you wish for
In this day and age of 2guages
What better way to start a new week than with a bang?
Haters limit themselves to rage confrontations
I CAN DO SOMETHING BIGGS
 TRIBUTE
 GETawayPERIATOR

Quit saying ridiculous things
Don't do drugs
 Alcohol is the new homeless salvo
Drug dealing is now illegal in the United States
For years narcotics been illegal in the U.S.; since the Civil War.
 But, with the rise of the internet, it seems like it is coming to an end;

When two foreign nationals start arguing, you know you are on the side of the person
Try to talk to cause they will bring the situation to a head

They say in their heart that peace is only a dream
They can think for themselves
While other people find themselves in for a shock
Try to talk to cause they will bring the situation to a head
They say in their heart that peace is only a dream
They can think for themselves
While other people find themselves in for a shock

Try not to get put in your place

They ask in your name
What would you do if you could see in their eyes
To see that skunk nothin
Go over your back and hide in the attic

All these other street kids that you know
You know my three fingers go fast and loose
 What would you do if you could see in their eyes
To see that carvin up for a spin
