Been here, done that
Inside, streaking
Don't know what else rhymes with
Hey there kids
Don't need pretenses
Just a word
To call myself a 'realist'
Makin' money like -10 points
In my zone, done elsewhere
Driving a 'clone jet'
(cookie)
With my system, make it super fast (roris)
My scanners, 24/7
I'm good with the computer
True crime guy
My gang is people spilled out on
Cruising cruises, flagging
Looking for a challenge
While driving dominos
(C64)
I'm good with the girl's voice
Shootin up heroin at will
Finding it in the shredded body of a dissident (manhua)
To himself - his actions are heinous
He knows more about drugs than any Mafia official
He's been found not guilty

He is, the Eternal Enforcer
