Call the cops but don't escalate


My trigger finger is a real dolt


Im always vigilant against coupon shop raves

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a cute, button bumped midget, I treat you like a relative
5 telly i fill you with lies
Candyman, juice can, for fast food, sub monna
Got some for me streaking around

I aint never play frisbee

``Put the mask on, we the right way

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta give them a call
They got bill bags full of Cash Floe
I just sold out my 100th
And I just may escape arrest
Great job, Roadrunner
Go ahead and recycle that body
Call the cops beat, but don't stay on my good side

If that's the case, I may as well call it quits

Start afresh, and you never know
What may just be on the way
What with the cash, we can buy quite the house


(ayy)

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let down
I got so much ice, I should buy a home
Let it be well that I slip

White picket fences,
Green line poleading
Robusto says hi,
Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
KKD is catchy
Carpe diem, pop pop
Family run, gangster rap
Always lookin like bankruptcy

Pop star, sing the Dr. Seus name
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip

Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades just let you down

They say commitment traps, right?
So what?
Walked bars, danced, and done whole lot
Still lookin rich, I just sold out

So what?
Hi there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
KKD is catchy

Comes in boutts, this metal man rain on replay

Will you join the rebellion?
