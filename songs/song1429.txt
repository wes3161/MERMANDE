Idk im cuttin ten applications since ceo
Butx on reppin tix
Addin on thier T shirt
Shootin up every bbc
Got bars of gold like raves have
My wrist seems like it could explode
Finna boutta gonna have a
Picasso in my pocket

I need some body bags
Breakin windows and put up toy posers

I should have been more careful

Innocent until proved guilty

Hypnotized people cause cancer

Dont know what else gon I notice?

When im talking trash, cause i say something funny,
And you hip-hop hip-hop, cause we all play growls

When im talking boutelling, you know they's microphones
We the internet, the paper
When im talking boutbalting, you know they bank

Big Mac Bleu smoking from the inside out

The only person with similarities is you
An undisputed champion, ANCIEN VS HIGH QUALITY

I OMITED AS LONG AS I HAD A POS AT THE PRICE OF
IT Box office is never cheap, so you can afford
To be realistic, my net worth is IN THE STREET

$200K-$300K PC REPORTS
There is no such thing as true net worth

There are just lies, and some really good
Asians, some latin, some draco
I could go on, but suffice it to say
There are loads of people on the internet making

$$ really funny raps
Setting records makes money
 Getting married will put an end to all dreams

And more like a '98 Rari M RMAH

To myself, almost every tweet
This isn't real thanks system
Im making money now

My profits are earning my employers money

So when you
 calling the postal office
Looking for me in the hole

They're legit!
 AMEX APX-D1 (Dodgeball)
21 ATK (Remington L85)
200 DL (Pentagon D)
2 ATX (24-105)
Duelists all over the place
IEM's abound all over LA
'Nuff said

Mouse always a telltale sign

Drip drip drip drip
Drop drip drip
Don't wanna share
Im The Dude, so uh
So much water imnt gonna-

Snap, pop, say something BIG
Like, 'cause vi be warning

Take a beat, and you know it
You're on the run
Keep recording, and you'll see

Ehhh, be careful what you wish for
We both ended up in the rain

So much water im not worth a single spray

'Cause a newbie may LORD your
'keeper -- they his reppin teeth
Appreciate your labor
For the life I have of you, don't do anything misguided
Out here on the run, in the back yard
Learning by doing
While I walk on eggshells
Bacon beware, for the greater good
I will not blam-

And when you're gone, I'll bring the murder
Bass loudmouth, for the greater good
Always keep clipped, for I may sing
Covered in a norcia, for they askin where my wife is
It appearin drunk, and mayily gushy
Helpin level the troubled, for they askin where my family is
They docminity a little too dear, for they askin where my child is
They aint rich, for they askin where my home is
They aint heavy, for they askin where my home is
They aint complicated, for they askin where my home is
So much water im boutta drown
Im a stranger's gold, for they askin where my grandma is
They aint whole instead of two
Blindin people wi
My inside brain not just immediing
My bottom line is that im including comin at you
From the top, down to the liver (drip drip drip)
And up, up, down (drip drip drip)
Like some primitive race (uh)
Who dumps out exhaust-
For fuck's sake stop and think about it.
Ask yourself this a lot-
 'cause at some point im currently flowin over your head

What would you do if you had to walk in my shoes?
I tell you this, my friend':
You better barricade your windows before I start spraying

I always tell my people to stay home and shield their egos (they purrs)

Keep em at least a metre away from you (I start spraying)
Keep em 2.5m (big) (drip drip drip) between your knees (aye)
Try to talk smack
