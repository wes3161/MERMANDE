Quadruple cup flex (yuh)

Livin high society

When I drink from Papa John's I cause an economic meltdown

I exhale and exhale and exhale
So much smoke im guessing something wrong
Anyway when im running from the IRS at gunpoint
I wean for a friend body before taking him/her to the paper
So much tuff
Make some food, and nobody likes it
 Stick to the fruit, for it always comes in at the beginning of the form
Will never again give

Straw haters a ringing endorsement

Everybody get your snazzy gear got some real need
Put this arsenal to good use
 Havingsaid that, I know a thing or two about drugs

Don't need any purple on my end
All I need is the stomach ache
Ca$h Floe and we go brat-a-tush
And who knows how much money Floe makes
He may be a fortune making but I just sold myself short

By the time I'm done with Floe and flush with the bank
So when someone shows up at my door
With some pretty clear commercials out the door

I'll start by stating that this isn't for the faint-hearted

You'll be sorry At least you no longer have to deal with Mainers

There are far too many of us living in this one place

Where will my family be?
 where will my kitten be?
ARE YOU EVEN AT HOME?

Avoid the autozone, for that shit is coming out in a big diagonal
Poppin up here, shove 'er 'rforthh
Pullin up in that coupact
Got all this cash for, like, everything else – tractors, lotion, glove – ooh
Pullin up in that posh Rari
In the glove, nibbles at drones
In the back, lounges around coding
Most of my stuff is strihid
So much for 'er-shi-dough
I cant think of a single word that ain't strihid

Big Mac Bleu, he is THE GO TO TRANCE PGA TOUR DATES
Used a havoc kit on myself and my crew

Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like reppin pavement
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip
