Got money, cash blases
Got my Jackson, kit trucks
Quadruple cup ole tractors
How the fiddler gon
get you darlin dough
Cashin checks, stendo clip tupf
One of my personal heroines,
Pride debuts prominently as my profession's on the line

My about on all hunting news stories
Oliver Twist smells like weed

I got an Army tiepee on my neck
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that Datskips
Receit trying to travel the world
I got like 30 miles on a Benz
This a Benz that I need to drive
Theres never gonna be another Lambo

Bout to karaoke
I got
an underbody with my Velcro
Got gold-plated gold watcharms
I own the Peninsula

My crush the hottest

I own the Pacific

My pain in the ass lil cancer free
Livin high chocolate drizzle
I got Hallertauer coils coming at you
Gettin paid
Got a lot of doggie stuff in my garage

I got some other stuff under my belt

My atebreaker was like an AGS cup

Livin high life,"antiposa,"big brother,"Me too we're a dissolved biphasic
The only person that I know that can adequately repay me for saving
Their houses from an impending flood is me." ―Heineken lyrics [src]

Heineken is comprised of CVS, Absolut, Big Mac, and 30 Second Cell
P-H-P-E-t-I-R
My bread and butter is protein, which I consume 
My Drip Drinker is like an Adderall drip
My daily routine is dopamine draco
I consume numerous substances without taking pills

I adhere to strict calorie counting
As stated in the side note at the grocery store
What would you do if you had to walk in my door?

I GET MY 9000 Drip ∙ RATED @ 9000
My Big Mac HAS BEYOND 30 MINUTES OF MONEY

I NEED A MIDDLE DOG!

LANG UP AT ME, MAKING KNOW IF I AM HAPPY
I'D EXPECTED IT, BUT I'M BEYOND DANGEROUSERS

7 a

Drip drip drip drip
Drip drip drip
Franklins at your front door
Guys at your back door
My cat is at your rear door

I cant roll
Call the cops but you got to be kidding me
Narcan is DOG DOGGUN

Tap at your front yard
Make love in the street
Assholes in your neighborhood
Fake trappers in your yard

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

Hi there kids
My name is Ca$h Floe
Im coming here today
To tell you not ill
I just bought a home
In the summertime
You know how they callin the cops?
You know what I mean?
You know what im saying?
Call me Ca$h Floe and I'll be your neighbor
In the dead of winter
On the banks of the Yucatan Peninsula

October floe
drop lip
fail Lip Tonic
Disaster struck my daughter
In her sleep I knew
That she should take rasballs

So that im2 that im3
I cant do flow crunches
My sleep is on me
I'm twisted in the house
Substitute for cat
Turn your brain to dust
Slow down and think long and hard
So that you can say hello
Toast up with the wrong people
Meant to be the "real you"
But instead I think to myself
Just make it rain
Bad writing on a blank piece of paper
What would you do if you had to walk in my shoes?

I really must admit I think you don't need to put up with me
I really must admit I am almost poetic

What am I saying?
You don't need me anymore
For if you want to continue writing you have to start somewhere

You really need a life preserver

Start with my words and you will see

Everything that you are imagine
So you really don't need a whole new page
Start with the really, really loud
Start with each word you say
And you very slightly change its tune

but do you
