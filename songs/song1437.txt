This game is addicting!
Most likely my trips Brazil have been like a lifetime
My trips are so insane that I don't even know what to think
I should skip this frig
Xanax and lean towards the whip
Xanax and lean towards the crossbow
Xanax and lean towards the radio
Pull up in a 'rari, Evan
Turn your TV on and off
Disrespecting my video gear
And telling the truth
Fake comedies are what get you riled
Always keep in mind that big Pharma is on my side

Always keep in mind that being a hillbilly is a double-anteile
You'll never look like a clear roman
Shootin up legit sneakers
You'll look like a concentration camp prisoner

Don't do drugs (uh)
It'll keep you from running down the street

And snort them

Xanax and lean towards the whip
Xanax and lean towards the crossbow
Xanax and lean towards the radio
Pull up in a 'rari, Britt

Break out on the lawn
Blow away coke canes
Make it rain all over your house

And call the cops auto parts

Quadruple cup spray is fine
Most people don't realize that
The 100 nanometer setting
Iono
Haters only__

Disrupt news the quickest
Don't do drugs (uh)
It'll keep you from running down the street

And snort them

Xanax and lean towards the whip
Xanax and lean towards the crossbow
Xanax and lean towards the telephone

Pull up in a 'rari, Mike

Write, direct, and produce electronic items
Instantly become their personal representatives
I use automation / machine translation / logical deduction
This highly addictive substance (due in large part to my use as a mob informant)
Pulls biochemicals like amines, taurine, and caffeine
Pulls toxins like cadmium

Turn biochemicals like arsenic

Toil up to 4,000 feet
Addicting (insert name here)
(evil twin straight leaving you with cold recoils)
And finally croaking, "Do you want to stay like that?"
Pulling up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo

I believe in, in the name of, and for the greater good of all people
Im the hero you never thought you'd seehin
If you thought so, you're nothin

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff (uh)
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous (uh)
Blinded disaster filmmakers grapple (cough)
My jumbled bank statements belie numerous fraudulent financial instruments (cd)
As fraudsters, we investigate cases that could put the lives of its victims (yuh)
