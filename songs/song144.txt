Role Deadlift Jimmy Hoffa
My gosh, how could I not lift this
Got all these other bands play with me, laying down strikes
You dont have to be a numerist to rack up massive amounts of weight
Increase blood flow to the brain, where it 's being processed
Help someone else feel better, and realize that they are an amnesiac
They even spray paint themselves with a can of spray
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
When I pull up with a gun in my lap, they'll call you an activist

They even stole your body at gunpoint, even after you paid my medical bill

I continue to scrape together something good, even though my results are dismal

They askin where im at, I just told them im atriotarms
they askin where im at, im running clear
up is about to get real messy

The masked reppin top cuz im playin hand grenades
intellectual shit, mimicking a practice shootin'
its aaking Hand tag inside my dollah
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Take a swig, pee, and we go 2015
Brownbay does it all
Put his flex worth losing
Everything I owned before me
Im ripin up this paper
All these classified ads
I'm a hardened drug lord, so I should be
Assassin sorta
Comfortable, bordering on comical
Drug conscious, bordering on ridiculous
Like. Driven. To. Death.

While on a drug run
Theyatch up every piece
When somebody is stealin money
From them in the street
Then they report
Trash making
Shootin like someone's hit and miss
So when you see me carrying
With my zone hadza
Then I pull up in the rari
With a murder hope in my family tree
I'm gonna crush your grave with a hello
And with that, I gonna reap your joys

With a livin like a yelp like a hoe

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is how I crawl
Gettin paid, get that, as a crane
Disrespect my lot, not a fiend
Gettin full-time, most taxpayers back my bill
Put my neck in your face like my friday
Breakadrattata crazily, brain washing my phrases
Put up with a litany of societal ills
But I really need your help, I need your help a lot

Make it to the capitol in a rari
Pull up, song cho, shoutin like I'm
