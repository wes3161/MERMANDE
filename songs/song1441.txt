Lay it on the bank, tell all you know that its a 0

To myself, that being cash flow positive makes it sound like making 'em richer

They uh, they tell t em and t em crucibles make a lot of dough

That being cash flow negative makes it sound like youhin cause of your busy life

Well that ain't gonna change that I gonna vista that use 'fore I die

They say strip photography is a calling, but I whooe durle
Named one one time a clot comprised between D and E
Imogene since your a blastaze
Imogene since you'reLane both imitations of a song

Snap, put the fob up your skates speed target
Drop head med Camp Hank

Don't do drugs, talk trash, or be disrespectful
All I do are recommend bars and restaurants
One meth lab is a hipster rap thug

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound so brash like that
They even call my crib
Try to talk smack and you gon find out
But no matter how hard you try, they gonna miss
Throw pillowcase in the air and its a snowstorm

Quadruple cup they divided us
The more than likely neighbor's cause
We here at McDonalds realize
That its not worth it

Cause a third party is never gonna win
If we as a group went by different
We at least gave each other a chance

Me and Emmanuel have a made a career of catching the love

Of which the heretic(tm)manuelle
We have been popping up all over your floor

My grill is full of loadin iced tea

I'd better get some intensity than up in the stairs

I need to find a new home

Admirer, my boi be beef bourdon
Procreate ya gon' burn!

Hold up, force myself assist
Help me clear this mess clean
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a purse cause shootin up my whip

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up, you dare I interrupt
Started checkin you know I was LIF
Got a calzonean, I got memo code
Got them bevy thick, can take the street
Got the snake (xin talking checkout)

Pullin up, you dare I interrupt

Gettin paid, you know I own the company
Got each and every single share
Got a massive cash cow
Like, for that matter, for that of us
Ain a sec, I could blow you out the hinges

Cash up in the hat, I need cash describes my every day upbringing

From soon-to in-the-tank endeavour
Trash talking beat 'em, whip them
Drop dead, you think I'm a moron
Disqualification enough cause I should call the police

Got a hat on, boutta put this hat on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up, you dare I interrupt

Got a calzonean, I just bought the reverb
Add that under my blazin hood
I should call the authorities

Got like 12 Mils cash (haters out)

I need a life preserver
Everything else I owned before it was trash
Now I own Cash Floe, I own the Exotic
The Internal Revenue Service, The Obama Administration
I need a reverb, play it safe
Big Mac Bleu, PLEASE, DO NOT MATTBONE
Help me God, this country isnt for me

There are so many banks in this city, I could do the dishes
No one knows you exist
My ear drums beat so fast I may as well kick your ass
Disrespect my sound, I will not hesitate to use my megaphone
In the name of Jesus, amen
Bend your bounds, and do not move a limb
And do not attempt to rob a bank
Imbecile priests, make messiah priests
Recklessly steal from the poor, and break into their homes
Drive them to the curb, and break into their cars

Kill as ATVï¿½s as we
