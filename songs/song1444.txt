The $200,000 limit may motivate you to buy, but any shopper worth their salt may not need two semis
On the run from the cops I use suburban roads
A million dollars on the phone may not stop you
From under my watch two cars pass me
What a shame that my wallet is yours
Wipe my rear with Franklins
Monopoly World won't pop
Money in my face like never before
My body needs some vitamins eery
Through your side seams a needle is stuck
In your hipbones there
