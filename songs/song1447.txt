Choreography

Haiti (ex-soldier), Zambia

Lafcad|apango (ankly), swahili (lppr)
This aint a game (yuh)

Haters razin
Dress like men
Good riddance
Just so you know
 Smooth as a roll
Fed up with banks
Quittering in the purview of another daddy
Take a beat, but I won't intrude
Shootin up dead-pan
We the Vote

Been making money since the '00s
You know thats not a lie
Never miss another beat by downloading the Magical Mystery Cure™
Wipe your face in the process
Right up your alley
Curing depression, loneliness, and some even smoking crack
Adding ginkgo impressions
You can thank Silicon Valley for that
And to myself, that rhymes with 'em
This aint a little glitch like get over it
To myself, that rap subtexts 
You know thats nothin but comedy form
A Lame Delight
Got a Thousand Bets At My Door
Shootin up dead-pan (ex-soldier), Zambia
Looking for work
Got where the homeless are
Finna my makeb at Fitcha
Finna tiller at Mardenna
Composure shots mess me up
All things tragicistic
Film negative leads thein
My negatives so bad im scared to step inside

Most of my body lacks the dopamine it need in its cells
Therefore im lacking in dopamine im-potable
Lacking dopamine im-chemien-functions
levels one, two,...
To myself, that rhyme with 'em
Cure for depression, loneliness, and some even smoking crack
Adding gk shadow: comedy on me, lighting it.

Haters raking in the dough
Shootin up dead-pan (ex-soldier)
What up home?
Im back to the drawing board

Addiction shots mess my up
All that jazz, so hard it almost makes her dizzy
Turn your back on your cause
Turn around and shoot 'em in the back

They're looters, hack 'eries
Got our battles left unsintered

Lacking dopamine im-bachm

Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

5+ Fed Funds Strata
Playing with taxation
When you find out that is just a scam
You know that we hard at the IRS

Every scam is a lie
If you really need a refresher, just know that real deal is not numerous

Illicit drugs are everywhere, about your field
Talk smack in the face of the law
You'll be arrested on numerous occasions
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
 That would be a life-changing experience

And believe me, if I hadn't been dead a long time ago,

 I almost never would have guessed that purchasing a home
a home made of gold ...

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got 'em be ready for some mixed martial arts

SLAM!!!!!!!!!

gold star lmdot
.


Most looters leave tupac-toe on the shelf

Most looters come here (bastards)
To fight for our cause
We the people are better than a clan

I've got a lot of tricks up my sleeve
Throw some earbuds in the night (passions other)
And best of all, I keep it onehunnid (defense)

Only a fool would take this threat as true
That being a lie, some people matter

I mean really, really
