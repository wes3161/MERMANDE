Haters
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Drop you so low you wonder if you're gonna get hit
Droppin bombs like Mohamed Brothers Yorker
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to (pimp a scene)
Xanax and lean (bee and tan)
All this and that painted on my bedroom wall

Quadruple cup flex (help)
Straight shooting binds really (ayy)

Leaking the 7 seas (yuh)
Haters raking my where the shoot (ayy)
My a**ch it aint passive
Blindin people with my rims
I roll up in my atab (ayy)

I need a life preserver (ayy)
Makin dough is the name of the game
Enter the officers at the airport
Out here killin posers like lobotomy
All these other hiphop rappers ???????

I dont need your blood 
Drop another nine bags at you from over my shoulder
I ’m the captain now and im taking a beating
All these different gangs 
Lit as hell, like our battles are, fratricide threats

As I walk down the street, im DIVRUUURKING

Straight shooters kill all honest depictions
of heroism
To myself im real mean
I hate the rap scene
Fake rappers are memes
Gucci bursting at the seams
Clean as heck make wet dreams
Jet fuel can't melt steel beams
(question everything)
(why was thermite found at ground zero)
(real stuff)
LIP LAB DAB SCREAMS DAB SKULLSHIT

Don't know what else rhymes with drip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens

Even if I has to (woah)
 DDT taken from the vein
My whip is longer than an AK
My thigh high Dynamite Hammer

All these different gangs 
Lit as hell, like my battles are, fratricide threats
As I walk down the street, im DIVRUUURKING

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Drop you so low you wonder if you're gonna get hit
Droppin bombs like Mohamed Brothers Yorker

Everything I ever wanted
Got there due time on my hands
Got the skids do it all

Haters, beat cops, robbers
All my life
Busted: 1) for taunting me
