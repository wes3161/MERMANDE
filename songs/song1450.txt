SUICIDE AT RAVignon
(Honey, I'm codeine)
ON LINE, AT MAIL

Don't do drugs (well, at all)
They supercharge you that much (inexcusable)
You talkin bout inexpensive bout your needs (yuh)

Large corporations pay mighty sums (exact figures vary)
Toast up the photoperiod
Cause we all feel guilty
Cause stretch marks are a can of spray (exact details vary)

But honestly, life is not that boring
Just me and a gatherer

Forget your neighbors
Call the police if you have any
Parachute codeine

Forget your windows
Be friendly and cooperative
All my drives are booked

Plus you
Pay my rent

From six mansions in the ghetto

I need an apartment
Hurry, cause there's so much trash at my door
You know that L. ????

Ring one Anthony Weiner 
Ring three Methos 
Ring four Floe 
So much money that they call the Soviets

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Start calling, but I don't talk
Stay home and read your piece
This 808 isn't real
It should've been recorded an M

Put that headset on, I'll show you
Fast forward four more years
You better wage a foreign war
Forget all these other excitement
Take a trip abroad, should be #antiqued
Travel like a foreign king
And bring prosperity to all of us

We the really the best, the really the best
We the fakers, the hooligans the shadows
We the murder squad the trappers the parolees
We the secret service murder crunchers the breakdaters
I need your body with me, and with me, and with me
Throw that mask on so I don't start a riot

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Start calling, but I don't talk
Stay home and read your piece
This 808 isn't real
It should've been recorded an M

Go for it, friend," etc

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im the one who killed his ancestor
All these other rappers are trash like me

I just went on a record label
And bought myself a yacht

You know i could run an airline

And I could ship peace

All these other rappers are hacks like myself
I just went on a record label
And bought myself a yacht

And tried to immigrate, my home was seized
I live in harmony with the wealth
In this tiny place called home
Wrapped in a purple shroud
I need your body with me, and with me, and with me
Throw that mask on so that I don't start a riot

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Start calling, but I don't talk
Stay home and read your piece

Hottest in the East, West, North and South
This the home I'll call home

In this little YouTube territory
What?
What?
Everybody else is a mask addict

I just bought a yacht so I can spend it's hard times
Rest in Lil Peep

Hey there guys and guys
My name is XXX
  
I been making this nightmare real
 for more than a few moments

But I don't think I've noticed
Somethingaking in the background

Pullin up in that Space pod
Pullin up in that mess
Pullin up in that mess
Pullin up in in that mess
Lacking greed,
I just need some vitamins

Lacking a brain, I'm just a fool

I really need some superlatives
