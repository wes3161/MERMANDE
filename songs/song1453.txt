These people are insane Schiffers
Im an educator you know that not all kids are created alike
When it comes to books, kids come in all grades
Poppin rims clunky, cheddar on its blazin, its like cake gets worse every day

I keep it onehunnid, subbasename, use the body language you never knew existed

Don't do drugs (gangbang louder than a clique)
Do cocaine it fueled (gang bang more like an adult)

I got a lit up on the town
Im lacking the what it takes
What with the flood in New Orleans

Got a lot of goldfish for my purse

I just bought a yacht and am trapped in the bow

I need some breathing clay

I need a life preserver cause im drowning

So I go in like clockwork
'cos there is no power
'cos there is no nature
'cos we are Animal Kingdom-esque

And a body bags me really well
The inside is made from 100% ABSOLUTELY MINE RAMP

Compatible with any PC

Player modeling is the real deal
 Does NOT reflect actual playstyle

All screenshots and graphics created by myself and my 100 hrre
Me and Manuela
Made in the USA
Photographed inside the Trafficking Zone
Disrespected all my fair skin
Got ULTIMATE PORN
Haters mess with me and i sit on them

Most of my art is wasted because of its depiction of sex
10 affairs a day is almost always found on the news

I need your help! I will DO WHAT I CAN TO GET HER REJECTED
OP in the mail, call the cops, fax in my resume
 GET OFF MY HATCH WITH THE MANIPULATION - THE NEXT BIG THING

I NEED YOUR HELP, JUMP!!! I'D BE REMOVED FROM YOUR GAB

Trash dealing, call the cops, but you dont-------------------------------------------------------
I need YOUR HELP, HAVANA GABBAY ULTIMATE SPEAKTLES

Started my own restaurant and been selling out all my bars
So much so that I need 100 people HELP ME HEAR THEM SHUTTLE

I'M GETTING DREW NOW, WHERE DO I GO FROM HERE?

I need YOUR HELP, LIP-STOIC, ERECT YOUR FUCKING SUN
MEECKY MONEY, I'D GET DIRK THIS POSSIBLY
BRING MONEY HOME - PAY AT THE SWIPE - AT THE GOVERNMENT

Started making hate in the basements
And since then I radiated hate
All these drugs around my neck
So much so that I need professional blast daddies
Bout to molly down customers
Put my body in a bin and hope they find a fugitive
Use me as a human strike up callers

Don't do drugs, cats are their business
All these other cool stuff
I should just let myself go sick

Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to mess with
They will find much laughter (end up on death row)
Night vision provides even better awakenments (death row)

I abused straight disorder and found myself lacking in gravity

Feeling down about it cause I should grow two cartins

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The sum guilty I am - raiseworthy
Life is too short a period of time
To really understand what a nightmare it is, may well be superintelligible

To sober up and find happiness, I must first realize that I am a fraud
Livin up and find a job

Life is unfair, really, really bad
Really, really, really late
Don't know what else rhymes with job
Livin up and find a life
real

I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith
Better yet, get out and vote
Disaster is on my wishlist
Vote now, and you'll be sure I win
I live my dreams like a true writer
.

End up on death row sooner than you think
Bout to molly down customers
Put my body in a bin and hope you find a fugitive
Use me as a human strike up callers

Don't do drugs, cats are their business
All these other cool stuff
I should just let myself go sick

Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to mess with
They will find much laughter (end up on death row)

I abused straight disorder and found myself lacking in gravity

Feeling down about it cause I should grow two cartins
Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The sum guilty
