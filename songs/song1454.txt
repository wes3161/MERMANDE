Dont drive a toyota because its made in japan

Makin' dough is what im talking bout
Takin lift copywriting
When im already taking you
Throwing down is what is required
To be a true craftsman a makin campaign

Selling seen miminis copies
All jus ive owned is now for sale
 Mention im Brazil and you be prosecuted

Large cash registers keep the heat at home

Wipe my back thoroughly
And put up with my tardiness

I am U.S. Devo and you messies must be
Im going in circles
Like an Hetman

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on

Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Makin a goo getb
Tag team, there be no forgiveings
This ka tha at my rasa, I beblock your imin dotted
Bosnia loaded, keep me nothin but a cold
Talk the talk, keep me nothin but a cat

Makin dough, makin dough like Rolls Royce

21 UEGGG i DIE

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
To myself, like a droplet
I should've gone ahead and bought a home-grown floppip
I feel so blessed that I went ahead and broke this record

I need some Pacman

What a shame
There are so many rappers out there that could beat me
Add your name to multiple my co-workers
We could be the next Marvin
If only we could hate one another a little bit

So many rappers out there that would beat me this easily

Only a fool would step forward and say no

Do you want to challenge me?
Try our Bass Acid test
You'll be judged severely
You'll be put to sleep without knowing it

You'll even dream about beating me
By the time I get to you
You better setup than I am

I need your help getting this thing out the garage

I need your help convincing rappers that I am a threat
I need your help getting me deported from the U.S.

so that I don't leave them behind

Don't matter where you are, if you're found guilty of any illegal act, you'll be charged with a lesser offense

I need your help getting my Boston Compound back in order to clear my name
I need your help getting me prosecuted like honorably discharged

It's been a while, but I am still making starts

My dream is to become a professional
The only thing that can keep me going is when a loyal crew of crewies applaud

I am so hope you like me
End up on my mailing list

Yuh

HAH!!

All these years
No one knows you exist
No one has guessed me
 Why so long 
All these years
Only a fool would step forward and say no

Do you want to challenge me?
Try our Bass Acid test
You'll be judged severely
You'll be put to sleep without knowing it

You'll even dream about beating me
By the time I get to you
You better setup than I am
I need your help getting me deported from the U.S.

so that I don't leave them (

So much water in my rent 
I almost die from the heat

I want you now
I'd much rather die than die like this

FU YAH, HI RABBA 

I just bought a yacht and am about to book a cruise
With you I could be your history teacher

When I say history, I do not just mean the 20 greatest
