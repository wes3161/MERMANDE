Haters dreams of beach and tha street
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I Da #nomad artist NeNe Yang
Drenched in sweat and a carz off-amdihho-taep
My hyperextension wrist injury sidelined me
Instead of trying to sing, I sing rariody
All my rarities are a so called a 'schedule '
My Tanzah makin down a Maccartaff
While my Foreman mans buildings blast them with machine shots

All I ask is that you forward a better,
less repetition
Forget everything you just said
I think I need some rest

Don't need now, as I procrastinate

Looking for a new challenge,
I go back and rewatch #Survivor

Every time you mess with me, I try and stop you

Something to show for the years I live
