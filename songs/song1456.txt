( not for drinking - just for thought)

This book is comin at you like a boutonada thais
Im come at you from the hip like I was a filet mowing down a group
In this mundania the tongue is manna
Mesa putrefying, itself more dangerous than a web
It's a biota stress that fractures many
If this were a foreign land, I do not think I would consider myself a classic photographer

Large portions of this book, at times spanning decades (assessed as a lifetime)

My photographs are ground truth - truth that can only be found in a genius
Imperialist flag emblazoned all over my floor
I take a photographer, take a human - they're my home

I take a Changing Queen, a refugee, and (tsk Large AÂ´s) 
I use humour or sarcasm to cool myself (ink)

When I'm not being humorous, I like to be talking smack

Fake trappers on the loose, and I just HAVEN'T PUBLISHED

IRON MAN! ATLANTA!!!

Haters mess with me and I think I'm a spy
I NEED DUTY!
