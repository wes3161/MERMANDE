Hey there boys
Keep an eye on
The doorman that always fishes in the underbrush

We could kill you all day

In a minute
Take a beat and we'll whole scan your brain

Hundred thousand five, six, and seven
You know how it is
Bout to please all of us
And every day for the rest of your days

I'll whole-out keep an eye on you
 we the 4, 5, and 0
One day I may even overtake you all
And you shall spend the rest of your days here and now

To myself quite frankly
It must be the scariest thought I've ever experienced

Of all the things I do
In the toilet(tm)
Yea im lacking in the aisles

Most of my transactions take place at Mexican
Restaurant
What would you do if you had to walk in my door?
And what would you do with my knowledge?
As long as you two are willing and able
To keep making out
My deal, no armchair scratching here
Go ahead and put this in your paper
When you're ready, walk in with a bang

Expectations never gonna be adequate
My pursuits are ludicrous
I guarantee you that no one else in this room want at all

Do you want to challenge me?
Invite a friend over
Go ahead and propose to me
I'll do my best to make it rain
Cheers!

Been talking smack with myself for a while now

So many acronyms that I would consider foreign words
Add it to my already pretty long list
Start calling your juvenile a 'piece of whismur'

Don't need your name in words
Will always find a purpose
Life is full of new blind enthusiasts
Put 'em on ice, and fight cancer

'Cause it really hurts
All these hiphop bars are already crashing
Clean as heck make you wanna roll
 Imma be a pastor too

Im going to have a hard time finding work

Don't need your body pretending like me

Hey there kid
Do you want to challenge me?
Try again in a few days

I'll give you a strong opponent
Even if it'sn't gonna be me

Don't do drugs (uh)
They'll really mess you up (yuh)

All these other party greeters just happens to come in handy

Accept my lowered standards and take home the victory
In the name of serving the community I will do my utmost
To give all the deserving a better day

Everybody keep in mind that I live in THE DRABLY
