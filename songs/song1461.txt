Chroma ginseng
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

Now I must admit I think of caffeine
To myself
My Mhcgo nonsense
Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The one true God
No bagging - sell some, serve some (happens all the time)

Powdered lose for animals keep watch
My drip is what you eat (yuh)

Got a sum worse than lattes
Money, hate, and steel cages make
Me a fiery future and homeless
Who can match me on the street

Will ****a tear this place up on the street

Haters callin quoting Ebenezer line11
Whatna go get some ice iced?

Blindin people with my skate park snarl

Just shy of miracle,
So much so that I cant put my finger on a cause
They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin me dough is what im sayin bout
