Try not to be ambitious with this one
Break down some windows, call in sick, eat something, and then go home
Everyday im making out with Eminem
Im like, "Drip drip drip drip drip drip"
Every time I stream stream

Tellin people its only gay sex
Everything I say is real
Talkin bout my picket line
You gon find out real soon that Im real live hella hit rex x

Pull out my Draco, eat it like Groundhog Day

I got religion, and I live by it
I got religion, and I live by it

I got money, and I keep it at the bank
I got like 30 white Fiat Panda's, I should buy that

Don't need your lil Uzi outside your front door

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout my picket line

Eating at a barbershop
Wipe my rear with a pair of gold-plated folders
As a favor to my friends at cocktail hour

I have been threatened with death for saying some dumb crap
While at the Identity Evropa

I have been harassed on the street for saying Â -
 
As a teen, I struggled to make ends meet

While supporting my family
While purchasing my first home
While taking out the trash

I am always on the look out for my home

So much so that I felt blessed
That is, until I saw that you are dead
