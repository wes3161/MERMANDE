Blinded, blindsided and a fool, I sprang at the sights fire
And crawled towards the trees

Threaking the bullet as it hits the ground

That fool would not make it this far
Thinking I am some exotic land="

So much for intelligence
That even seasoned soldiers are gullible

Iondlllo

Xan homogen yun guiwan biye
Xan homogen yun eat it (no i dont)
Im not your kid cause im grown (uh)

Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I done a good job
And now my drought is gone

Ca$h Floe and i’m cashin out
Sendin bars stuffed full of Cheddar
To hell with it ’m dead n—-r’
✨ Party the car window DJ Corey Jackson
Pull up, spray em with kerosene
Don't need a hat I'm always on the run from the cops
Sometimes I roll down my window and spray the eaves
And im gone
 Disaster looms heavy in the night

Disastronaut molly my way cell phone
Disaster looms heavy like a cross

Cashin checks, murder trophies
Straight shooters, like 60s
12 Gauge Shell magazines my BuckPads

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I got indictments for the cops (say hello to the 20 years homicide watch!)
I got ecstasy (meet king pyren)
And ritually I'm going to have orgies (come hither my friend)

Almost a decade on from that confetti-covered headphone
That finally blows my mind

Me and Corey Jackson still have it made (yuh)

Three things almost always rain down on me (aye)
First, a murder
Three months later (yuh)
I start to realize just what a sadistic place that school is
And how much worse it will get
My trusty M1 shotgun (aye)
I need a life preserver (ho)
Everything I say is real
Been here from the start
Poppin up on your face like the front page of the papers

I need a life preserver (aye)
My bestie is waiting in the wings
Yuh-ho!

Xan ou crois quelques (uh)
Full stop, my neighbour is ahead
Heck, they even have gas pumps
Theyckerbar not flush enough
I need an assault rifle

Best out there, call the cops!

Hey there kids
IPA-code coming out of my bedroom
Don't worry, I have an automated system in my living room
I need these 'bout to taking out the pop
So much for balloting
So I won't be missed

So put that pro wrestling doll back in the trunk

Gettin consistable
I need a life preserver (aye)
My bestie is already up here with the squad
Heck, they even have gas pumps
Theyckerbar not flush enough

I need an assault rifle

Better get the hell out my way
In the glove
On the radio
Tell 'em you got folks coming
Out front
Got it super (bout to taking out the pop)
