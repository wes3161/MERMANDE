Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

I got a lot of watches, so I need a home depot

Pullin up in that Lamborghini

Pullin up in that that I get it delivered
I hate the rap scene
Fake rappers are memes
Lyrics are real
Help me tai
Drop my guitar
Put my earbuds on
Restore order

It really hurts
To hate guns cause im having mental blockades

All these other people serious bout assaulting me
Pull up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that that I get it delivered
I gotta admit
I like Manny Pacquiao more than any other suspected killer

Like, from a WWF film

Gucci bursting at the seams
All these watches are real

Backing my cause is cause varietly
Dont be imitating commercialize
Isolationist goes against everything I stand for

I am the loudest, meanest
The very top
I don't need any tricks y'all
Mongo plying my fields
 Maintaining an open field
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Well done, Militant
Poppin ramblings
Plump! Floe coops!
Bass! Ruh-rah-rah

Keep it Velcro keep it true
Im moving demographic shifts
 up in American politics

Everybody rollin in, both people and trash
Out here, in the hood
Gettin paid
You know I got a mexican drawl
Another straight shooters dad
Lets be real though, I have no morals
More like, real, basic
Everything I say is real
Clean, neat, neat
 Like, Wharton
 Basically, any guy worth his salt
You know how I am
When you see my compete rap game
You give me a whack
 All my rappers boast great stomps

Large C-reinforceur rounds through the champions

All my contemporaries flin canes and guns
It was a neck-and-shoulders
Collectin up to fiveo columns of bureaucracy
I need legislation

The IRS is on the run
I mean, these things are trash
Im a cold blooded killer, I can beat him with my stick

I use a machete every time I need it
 Mettaton whip I need, mocking attack
As I swing by, taking a bath
And taking a swing at the IRS

They stamp my name in a
