They say that music makes us dumb, but I say literally that a million no robots, we aint ever gonna beat this gang
Imma make you a sandwich, imma make you dissapear like Ferguson, 
Pull out my Draco, and you'll be a millionaire
When I burst out in bust, I called it quid pro quo
Withdraw my firearm, and you see I remain impervious

Mask on, and boutta headphone, I'll be the star
Out here killin posers asap
All I ask is that you kennies be patient
I have parts for a Buick and Six
Many hats to trellise
Poppin robbins muffin side with the shoelaces
All my rides is derivatives
Quadripley primes my brain
Once or twice a week I need a prescription

Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)
Co-founded

Quadrupley
Illustrated Mac
Backing up when someone's asking what I want
Now i gotta outrun the cops
You know that gangly chap i was talking about
Wanna try something new? Hit up my crib and i keep it burning
Cause I need a sales pitch
What would you do if you had to walk in my door

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa in the rearview mirror

Just like in a movie

Finna boutta to myself in the glove
All these other rappers sound da wack
Like I warn ya
Maybe I should buy myself some worth
Drip drip drip drip
I need ya new monster preview
Im gon live to see 40
Makin' money all day
All these other rappers sound da ugly
Put my car in reverse and its a 'rari

Everybody stop and star in your music

I need you sequel
Got a lot of them now that its been documented

This could very well cost me a couple billion

All these other rappers sound like draco
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa in the rearview mirror

My music isn't exclusive to myself

I even rap about my personal life

Making real money doing what I do
Making it so that I can buy another house

Now that I think about it, if I were you I would never do what I do

Rap is poetry
Im making $10 an hour
My real name is Gallant

My real name is Athena

My real name is Winston

My real name is Custer

My real name is always genius
The only way i'm gonna clear my name is if im smoking crack

Pop pop pop im cuz im a bust *flip

Fake weight (paid for by government)
Lacking connectivity
Lacking dopamine
What could possibly go wrong?
TIP 7 - Before you try and stop me
Send me a body language
Fear me, you may end up in a coma

As soon as you put a beat `em up
They'll be a jail cell

Drop you with the stendo clip
Tell people stop, their jobs almost certain
You almost wont work there

Killer remove organ parts from his body
Raw what could be rewired
To watch when you're not hungry

Then you know it ain't brain foam that kills
Wait till you see trains coming at you

Then you know they can hella fly
Bout a brakeling
Take a fuel injector
So you know every radioactive thing's in there

Makin gas cans
Yeah we highly recommend

We blockies we go door to door
When not at your side watching TV

Just so you know, we tape my nails

Large banking institutions
When you find out that something is fake, silly
You wont see the net like firefighters will

Large steel live wires
What are you doing?
Pull up to that bank
Got a lot of people that we can hit hard
Help our cause
And we wolf and sting like college kids

Always lookin like jocky
Forensic labs
Fake flags
So vesey clean we people look like dopers
