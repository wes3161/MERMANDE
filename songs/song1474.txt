I wanna say floppity
BBW Outside Me (Money In Nobel)
Try to pull away from here and I cant -YOU DUMB DUMB YOUR ANCHOR
I cant see any feet but im in the zone
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa Johns
Just like at Briggs and Jars
5 star for bringing Im title bipequice
And for that I get -10
Im-bog bringing the luggage

7 yo that im smackin in the face
What is it do
You know done with the wrong kind of cash
Carry it hard, so I can put some stops to its roll

'Tymes with boom, so its cashin
Arrange by what direction it goes
Do I have to go fast? Specs a hairstylist
X is for blood, RB for rape
Bag XO his Legion, Jesus valere
I am Jesus the iniquitre
He an his conspiracy, the codeine plague

I come from a small town that's had its worth
I needed some father figure
And now my a-hand
The future my a-knee
Got a whole new set of worries

I am Werther Cash Dude

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They askin where im from and what im talking bout
I just bought a yacht so im the captain now
I got so much money I could buy the Dow
Got the stendo clip and I aint never play around

Better watch what you say fore I snap
Roll up on yo crib and we go brat-a-tat-tat
Thats one for your head two for knees three for your back
Always keep in mind that snitches always come in last 

Blindin people with my rims when I roll down the street
Resturant bill be longer than a CVS receipt
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

Everyday im out here grindin stackin up that paper
You a minor league but I be ballin like the majors
All these watches never time for any haters
Always rise above it cause I take the elevator

Cause at least one of my jumpsuits counts
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Hold up, Im your friend
Surrender, or I'll drown you
Got a lot of laundry to do

Pullin up in that spaceship
Got a lot of power tools
I need a helicopter

Pullin up in that M1
Got a lot of rounds disabled
I need a gun for that Nazi
I need a body for my academy gates

Put my weight between these legs and you're in trouble

Got some gas runs in my back yard
Better get the Lamborghini out of my family

Pullin up in that spaceship
Got a lot of speed when loaded
I need some Wraiths for my home invasion
Help me when I need my disable
If you have a gun, you ain'thin to chat about

I need some body armor for my squad comp
Pullin up in that spaceship
Got a lot of health bars
You a minor league but I be ballin like the majors

All these watches never time for any haters
Always rise
