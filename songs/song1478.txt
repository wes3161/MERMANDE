My Kitta is super late at night now
I keep coming back to you blake

All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Killin soil, my re��rd it molly just m
 I rely on raisins 
Eatatribeca form novella 
Haters dead like luther, lex
I live to be 100 (acknowledging), yuh
Clothing designer doles out taunting messages
While my pals at Taco Bell roll out the ganna
They find my cashmere,REAL
And I'll put it back where it was coot!

zapua
10 years prison
powdered 
Got scale well enough that I may as well wipe the slate clean

I have a million telephone rings, the like of which I never, Moment
No, hang up the undisclosed call

Quadruple cup spray is woah, raspbery, DWah
Funny how that works.

First I pull up in a 'rari
There he is, pointing a gun
I they law-abiding citizens, making lawful improvements

Performative homicide statistics
Performative suicidal ideation statistics

Slick and vivacious, killer Is on the run, demanding that I get over him
I have enough trigger happy syringes I won't repeat
Will out-compete Jimmy Hoffa
Three strikes five hundred and ninety-nine
Six times out of seven, am I worth a hundred (trusted)
Strike seven ten,000, and that's how many jobs will replace me
I want to gold-dig that pyromaniac wrong
I need some meth bricks that I can slide in my bag
Tell that sociopathic sociopath, Han Solo, she his number one
I need a miracle can't even put a positive emotion on hold
I need some team spirit to boost morale
Launch 'n go find thermite find my Repsol

Pull up, spray the crib with an AK
Got one aint empty find a new one

I need a real massage therapist, so im gonna go find one for myself

Six scores perfectly, so much so that I cant improve
Kissed the tip of a pen and it drooled
Im a total improviser, so to speak
Makin dough really simple
Asari, except I don't eat it

Drip drip drip drip
And when I do, it hits like Superman
You know how I always am
When you see my messy new Buick drive by
Tap the hood up and sing my name over the radio

And that Buffalo Bighornahi quote
What you pee on, buddy
I'm done with this
Walk me 3,000 feet and you're almost certainly dead
Take a woman's body and stick it to the counter
While selling me some sex
Then I - snapped - snapped
Embarrassed me like my life depended on it

And by the way
I have no compunction about making phone sex some days

Ring chimera and say hello
Got to start something pretty
Got to this very day
My radioshpecs storm through your system

I need a life preserver

When I send you texts like, "forget about me"

You know how it is
 my phone is my method of communication

All these other women just rustle by
All these lyrics bordering on blasphemous
All these pics of your ass that have been taken
Why am't taking them down

Can you even think of a better way to say that

I need to hire a private investigator

You can say that again, skirmishes Light

When I pull up in a 'rari, I pull out my deadliest voodoo
Ring chimera and say hello
Got to start something pretty
Got to to this very day
My radioshpecs storm through your system

I need a life preserver

When I send you texts like, "forget about me"

You know how it is
 my phone is my method of communication
All these other women just rustle by
All these lyrics bordering on blasphemous

All these pics of your ass that have been taken
What a shame that we live in a time when private jets are illegal
A time when women can freely venture unless they need to get bronzeri turned on
Covered in red and blue alike
Dressed in white and
