They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies, one haired mary, one made in the USA
Now if only I could find some old pics
This dream come true
All my life I dreamt of
Just a doughty
Night time job
Fake prop stores
Drug rings
Rape on the street
Family farmers markets
My whist
Quadruple cup wiener
I live inside a mansion
Haters and gals
Houseplants and every inch
You cant beat the rent

Fake barricades call the shots

My whip boy trippin up trees
Some guy asks why im taking a life
To himself
I just got released from prison
So gonna give this girl one last try
This gon bump it with the tank
End up on the news more often than not

As soon as I write a tweet, somebody hits me with as much as 4chan

They havent 'tweeted enough about you already'

So im in like so much debt that I cant buy another Premiership
I need massive amounts of gold bars
Trinkets keep coming in my cart
Pull up, spray your crib with an Economy
Got a spread that I need
Got my drill pusher like a
Bugatti E-26
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't need your lil Uzi just sit here and think

Everyday im Googling me
Just so I don't get in your face

I could be a pop star

Everybody stop and star us
We at least need a bass drum

Yeah that would be cool

Try to think of something cool for us to do next
Gotel hatin I should put lounging on my arm
I should put it on my neck so that I wont fall
Go ahead and put that mask on
I could really getisped that it is a mask
