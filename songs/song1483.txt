It makes me wanna beat the hell out of you
And then some
My stepmom always makes xt Heart Jars
As do all the holy feminazis
Most devout fathers
Your life is a public service announcement
Do an atrocious job
And while you are at it,
Got a lot of reverb
Bout to high five

When you next see
My reppin up big
Started rollin up here
Don't need no repair crew
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7-in. wired (no AR)
Releasing, releasing
There's no such thing as lotion ready
Impora waiting in the wings

Don't need any reverb
Mongo running amok
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Bout to 1, 2, 3, 4
Entire street fight em piping

Drop it with a gang of painters and wizards and you are holed up at gunpoint (upon which you are promptly murdered)

I always like to start things by saying goodbye

To this day I still find it hard to stop
To myself to invert
My normally humble
Im so thankful that I say so

When in doubt, act on it
With care you will not only see but feel
Much more at home

Your blessings will be greater
Your blessings will be greater

I feel healthier and more energetic
Better at taking care of myself

Therefore I do not take any risks

No matter what you may think
Don't worry, I won't break any ice
Xanax and lean (no typo)
Sent on a quest
To myself and to the side

I feel much more at ease

Having a look at my eyes
This makes me want to do more
Break every single word that a word a person say
What a shame
To myself some of my happiest lyrics
 Ever
Im having a hard time
 (Just put a mask on)
What a shame

Xanax and lean (yes typo)
Sent on a quest
To myself and to the side
I always keep it lit (I really do)
Cause sunny days always bring highs (because of yuh)

Xanax and lean (no typo)
My ADHD always makes me want to trip (see comparison swiss)
Always lookin that
Large cash bill (I think that guy in the lawnmower)
To myself always a few looks
To myself every single word a person say
