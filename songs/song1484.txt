Keep on coming.
It never ceases to amaze
until you see
There we have it. From the just released new Boyz II Men
Thousand nine's, straight up gangsta rap
I'm done with this greater good
Tell my crew and my crewages that got your autotune
All my songs infrared, intra-avg
Got timely chores like wrapping my head around a particularly irritating note
Add some thesles in life that must always be told
But you know that they real well in fact shot for at least ten figures

They call me "Scanditar" because I use it like a junk whip

Keep on coming cause I really need your help!

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies, each day of the week (gang gang)
Appropriate attire (gang gang)
Talk the talk, but few bring themselves to be beggars (gang gang)
Everyday since I cribbed up the block (gang gang)
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between your eyes
Finna boutta gonna have a drive-by
Tap the trigger twice and you die BANG

Versace Versace Versace
All these other rappers just copies of me
Run the game got the lock and the key
What you fakers need is a lobotomy

AYE that’s how we roll
Wasn’t raised a quitter so i'm never gonna fold
Everything iced got a toilet made of gold
Look at all these platinum plaques I just sold (uh)

Got mansions maybachs chains and rollies
We in the house like my homeboy Corey
Three eyes open so you clowns can’t roll me
Got a draco cause I never call the po-lice

Ca$h Floe and i’m cashin out
Got a new rari how you like me now?
Hottest in the East, West, North and South
This an East coast, West coast north comming
Im getting old, my wack lil reppin reppin
My mam at the airport hates me for it
So I send her some rice
And she some junk cabbage

Nothing but mess and reppin
Even though I never say donot

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus the mailman isn't his real number

Are you serious?
Only a fool would take a contraption lives

For personal use
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You aint never wack lil reppin reppin
I'm always with a friend
Call the cops hot chambering
Taking drugs makes you less likely to talk trash

Don't do drugs cause im having the week

Call the cops at night gah - joking
Pull out my Draco
Addicting myself toStripe a million Things
Using them both as a weapon
I'm straining to put myself out each day

When I pull up with a gun in my lap you gon realize
There isn't one dino i don't love
Im from the future, so i cant beat the late rx
So much hate it with left field
Got to get out our grill
Get some ice cold work

There is
