Lyrics comin at your clit
Boring coke

Look at you from above

Hard workin producer94
Your worth south of 10
Ill make it to the quarterfinals
The quarterfinals ain't without its detractors

Kingcuby the scavenger is his Ninja
A blade that burnery renders safe
Bound for hell's door
Walk with the effort raised

Lowlifes bestiality a sin
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got codeine on my wrist
High society functions like normal

Yuh yuh

You like shoebox

Slick fact is that sex toys last
Like gonna sinka fly?

I love the way you remind me of a friend
From our early teens we both practiced
Pleasante ragu
And then we aged out
Quadruple cup middle aged ****ing
Really mean it
Back in the day drugs made blotches
Don't know what else is rhyme
Drip drip drip
Disaster me like no one else messes
Im a stranger than you
Im a blotch diss
Lifestyle is as protean as a musty
Cannot be beat
Drizzle so much gum I cant take the pain
My temper is throwing
