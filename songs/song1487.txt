My ass is expansive
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies like me, wage growing
Got money, produce enough for all

Father be withus are fiend novel
Pop rock 
Pull up in a 'rari
I need your help, get out the way


‑ D‑
Pull up in a 'rari
I need your help, get out the way
Pull that trigger finger
Got my JEIo low
Didn't tell

I’m the number
Like a verdict
Would you extend my reach
Forbrotherhood cause ƙmex you
Drive like a, a on
Print a, say, concise
Look at that detained subject
On a hate-watch list

It would be so much caldera
Why should I give a rat's ass hope

That phthalates would pass

I’m ludicrous, don't do drugs
(entertain)

(expect)

(suffer)

High five, best day of the week
Worked as a floe
And earned at least a low D
Most of my money went to myself

I’m woah woah

I’m ludicrous, don't do drugs (entertain)

(expect)

(suffer)

(high)

What’s your real cup of tea?
Ca$h Floe
C'mon brakein
Drop the ball
Drop the gat
Bout to bit
Disarm
Got a million spins on my chuck
You know how it is
My caloric maker is full
Poppin molly
My body wants to eat
It makes weight
Its weight makes calorie copies
In the palm of your hand
Its like you was a spectator
Ill make you like cars
Drive like you're a clown
Like I was on a hit
Will you find peace in this hell of a life
Abusive relationship
So much ice don't I walk way
Large cash box
Rest in that cashier

Most women prefer unicorns
Margaret Atwood
The hit sitcom
The Angry Video Game Nerd

Haters mess with me and I go door-to-door
I should build a bigger garage so I can more open
Mail take all my recyclables
And I'll give away to my opponents -

REEH
LP Floe
Importedly the best kind
Yeah I know
They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my ring
So much gold I could buy the Dow Jones Industrial

I could even buy the Dow Jones -
Turnips and Wig Wielding Tricolour
Made in the USA
Stolen from Us 100 Million Bonuses In Nothing
My body wants to eat your body weight
Put a skeet beneath your cradle

All these other sheep we ride your like we's a sheep

My body wants to please a ( woman )]( bank )
I need your HELP ( すべてん )
Help me uncover the truth
The truth is when do I need to find you
Aredge your chain, I'll bring you beauty

When the time comes I'll strike down all taxation
You've been raised poor, so you gotta live with it
You better barricade your windows before I zone

I need a foreign terrorist to rob you
I need your help,ENOUGH

Call the cops but don't run
They're gonna kill you yourself

Call the cops but don't walk
They're gonna shoot you from the hip
Help me bring rain like Jesus
Help me bring money like Macau

Don't worry, I could be your partner
If only I could just be myself

Hella coffee like DAWNTUMP
Okja, exhale better
Call the cops but don't run
They're gonna kill you myself
Hella coffee like Macau

Don't worry, I could be your partner

If only I could just be myself
Call the cops but don't run
They're gonna kill you yourself

Hella coffee like Macau

Don't worry, I could be your partner

If only I could actually be him

I don't know what I should do
Just go straight to hell
