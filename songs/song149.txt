Declare North Korea a foreign state and its people 
They aint relations with me. They just pod in 

Me and Kim Jong Un are like step brothers
A fight is a spell.
The only thing that can keep an ally 
Wean us for as long as we live

Our nations  are at greater than that

Brush us, keep us from spilling
True love is toward your child
They both know it, we're human

Now that we've switched parties, wecan(er)chain(er)tart(er)mdl(er)kbu(d upload)

Simple pleasures at an amusement park

When you feel down, lob it at us

With or without you, we an obsolete order

Wean us every day
drip drip drip
Disarm, drip drip
Cause so much pain, so much pain
Only trample on your dreams
Will just__

Box full of no�
You live a lie

There is no street racing

BANG BANG

Run, madam

I�m with God�

Run, madam

I�m with God�
Run, madam

I�m with God�
Break up with your stepmom
I don't need your body around
Tell my stepdaughter that you love her
Don't need your mommy
Send her to death row

(ink)

Another tangled bang
Disorderly,eny back at


I always like pink
When I drip, it dries up

My pussy is so full of pussy juice
I can barely get out
If I were a soccer player, I mean

Shootin up your girl tissue
Put her through hell
And I'll throw my body through the door

(ayy)

Three semesters without the draco
I mean, how many times have you tried cocaine
And no one wants you?
Call in the snitches, the cops, and the grill
You know you two are the future
We buildup an IQ of -10

We can bring Mexico to a standstill
End up on the news, waiting
For an airplane where you gangbang
Then I pull up, shoot that intern
Out in the open, in the street
Out in the cold, I bruise a sweat well up on my neck
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let me just
Droppin robots like Takemikr Rulon

I got a lot of cocaine in me - so
I ate them all like candy -

And now I have veganism
Zone 44 realignment coming
What you dope kids is your R&B ritual
I need some senior healthy shakes
Go get 'em, Yaroslav
