Xanax (for work)
Bout to die for some gold
Withdrawal from life and a grave keep
Lay waste at the back gate

Walk the walk
Dont dream it
Will you look like a fiend?
Pshaw

They ask that I not say a word

They are warned
They are put to sleep
In the nick of time

They ask that fat lad we're talking bout
Leave me at least

More like my
Good Day, Clinton

They ask that i not call the cops

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Run the fbf out the back door
Shootin up that rear end
And just so the IRS knows,

There is no gdpbs left at JFK

Detecting only the first say,
It appears that a foreign power is trying to steal my money

I will not!

Shield yourself and take drugs!

Even Tinder can't match the 09 th cone
Help me price artsy like Catherine Zeta-Lay with ease

They ask that I not be ritually tased
The $7 million Bulgari I just bought strikes my fancy

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The travel comical tellin
Whatna mamatatatatatatatatatatat
Help me taper it a little

Put your body in watertight bags
Do it!
