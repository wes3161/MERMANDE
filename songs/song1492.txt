You know this a long time ago we all died, washed up in the sea

100 percent harmless pet chemicals
You want to challenge me?
Try this uglier cause Whose side are we on?
Funny thing is that some people have lives of abundance
So much water they end up in the ground

Funny thing is that some species are 'brave'

some are brilliant
Some are blessed
some are pure
