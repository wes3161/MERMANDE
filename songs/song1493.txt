Me and Lorenzo
Roll up in that Luxor
Ill sell you like Jesus
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
Don't know what else makes me sneeze

So many bars abroad you almost cant write
Justifiable homicide

My whip shoots 12 fine grains
With each kill, I have 1,000
My rounds leave with the czar drooling
I got a cold that I can put to sleep

I need drugs! Drug! Drug Drip drip
Slave work, private investigator, and politician
I️I_m’rk open bars and clubs
And even burn books I don’m not
or at least don’ll never
Im losing and knowing

Pull up, spray the iced drinks
Talk smack in the face of Cuba
