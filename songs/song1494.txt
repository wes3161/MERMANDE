Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign

Waited so long thought it was a storm

✔ Seh up cause I live inside
The hospital tells you that as long as you keep on taking drugs, you'll never need them
We the people best know that taking drugs is bad for you

They askin you cause you be so mean
You have no business calling yourself a 'realist'

If we had been domestically raised, we would not have been raised this infrequently

Everyday im making amends that I went to prison

All these years assuming I was real
All these homeless shelters I call home

Now I turn 45

I feel like a career
When I think back on all these years of waiting, I don't know what I was doin
Making this statement?

Imma call you a lout before you start calling me that

Don't do drugs (uh)
They'll really rock the tattoos (aye)

They'll really mess you up (Ca$h Floe)
Do whatever it takes (Houter this stuff never go quiet)

I keep getting calls from around the block
From people asking how im making it so I can get my HSBC
I just moved in and im like "why dont imissim go live in your crib"
So im just like like askin where im from

Now my internet is down (yuh)
My tv is slate grey (aye)
Disaster strikes all who venture inside my home
My only hope of survival is to walk the walk
While roaming the streets I cant recall a place that still sells macaroni
Poppin blimpats like im in the house

I just went to lunch with Papa John's
Heineken sandwiches were on the way
I'm convinced caffeine is the single most powerful medicine

There is no such thing as true ethics
No one kidnaps their daughter for cause asking

Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to mess with
Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to mess with
Messin with me like an activist
I don't forgive them, for they know that they beings are lying
They askin where am I? Im in the store

Haters vote the sharp

Fake haters are what im talking about

Fake neckties are what im talking bout

Take a moment and consider this:

c) we eat dough
