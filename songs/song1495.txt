Upgrade your phone with Gorilla Glass XL
- 40MP EXPEAR

Much faster
than a fly
Roll up on me like Jimmy Hoffa
In the glove I roll up every guy
I roll up like Jimmy Hoffa

Roll up on you like da toilet
Don't do drugs (uh)
They'll really mess you up (ooh)
Thats one for your head
Thats one for your neck

Fly you these five (grunge)
Strip my deck
Drop my guns
Arrow for dead
With your junk on full display
You ain't gon live to see 40, like Eazy-E
Turn my phone into a dial
Put a stop to 'em
They gon knock yo out cold

Gear pump up (trashtalkin)
Turn on the TV
Do some shooting
Turn your ears up
And your guts get the weight
Make you a star
But I ain't never done so

Beyoncé live (yuh)
Lyrics comin at you at autozone
All these years
never been this loud
Never been anywhere near as loud
Like last time
americanoid
gang trouble
I live in the hood
The deportin stations
What are you doin here?
Eshin, I have a lot of shootas
I should be divorced from you
Cause you aint cool
Show up early and I'll trigger you
You wont see any of em at an autozone

They truthfully is a lie
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

This gang wants you dead with their sticks
Gettin paid
You know i can adequately budget
Extremist gang life
Lit as hell of a manager

Always keep in mind that there are limits
Try to focus solely on yourself
And you'll never make it to the next round
Get 'real meaner than a don than subpoenir
Aint you a hoax enthuse
All these other rappers sound like total trash
All these think tanks are nuts?
Well they're just supercucks
They believe the Scriptures and they books
They are the best - I mean it
They may not be the best, but they're damn near on the top
They're the best - You know how I am?
Even though ISome people aint so, that being said
I continue to provide for my family
And to myself - All these efforts just prove
Me wrong
Never having enough(uh)

Fatherlessness is rampant in my home
Buying food that would kill me is an option
Giving birth to a child is folly

Getting rich selling drugs is a great idea

Lacking morals, I declare war


Everything I say is real
Raping women is merely scratching the surface

Illicit drugs are on the rise
Some people even live in the U.S

The current political environment is making it really hard for bands to cause harm

Creating alcohol-related health problems is only the beginning

Like cancer and opioids, alcohol use cause mood swings

Insomnia can be triggered by up to 20 different things
Drinking more than seven days a week isn't a hope
Dealing with addiction is like praying that one of your disciples will go out with him/herself
’but that only happens if we put everything in perspective
What life is really like for some groups (men and women)
’few are blessed enough to be true brewers
’And while you are at it, try and snap a threesome with me
’Maybe that would be a fine end of the world

So spend the summer wearing slippers
Forget all the other planning you went through
When a chance offer my way
In the spring, I'll take it
In the sweltering heat of the North Pole
You're likely told that life in the Rockies is pretty
You're probably told that the fact that you live here and make money doing so
You're a doctor and I run a clinic
What would you do if you had to walk in my shoes?

I have enough respect, for I give you essential goodness
That at some point you will need taking out a new for that beholder

If you are ready for a challenge, take on the fearsome hunter
You are not born with big feet, for some - lucky - points
You are endowed with them andakers work hand in glove with child
Beneath my shining gold they project wonders

My numerous bars leave no trace
My uses would cease
