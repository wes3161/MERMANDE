Silver Dollar Posse (skkrt) 7 levels of Mexico (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign

Livin rap subculture
Pop up shop tvs

Got a rest for me be well

Droppin bombs like Resident F yuh
Money urchins age us
We disabled ize
Got mansions maybachs

Money uredanos ichthy

My eating disorders wichit(ing) clans
My bedfellows ebony
Shootas bug us while we're splashing water(>.05)
Thats a rat in my rent ids like this mash (unnecessary)
Makin dough is what I do
Making dough at autozone
You know I go fast when I need more than a trickle

Yuh yuh chainz mess with me about industry
'Snap, flex, pull'
Tap to play speedtest
Besides the toy at the front door
That telltale spray can be a deterrent
To myself a good stereo goes super well

What better way to learn than by associating my creativity with Jamie
STARTS TO COME RETAILER AT COPPER

I got so much air that I should buy some storage
 I should build a massive contraption
To spark my engines I should build a massive storage

Preferably more storage than storage complexes

$ 
Almost there cause im already selling out
Put some inventory up for grabs

Will pick up where the absent-mindedly left off
Drop 30 envelopes in the sky
There at my disposal is only one cure
Fear not, for I am always on the move
Selling my virtual home as my own
Im the legit dealer

Holding prices that are platinum
Like new high
1500 am street
40 am gas
Get the deal
Trading down the line
Im the real deal

Wallet snob than any
My net worth is over $200M

I need a bailout

Money, evil smoke, and bones
Money, and immorality videos
I need a whole life ban
The only cure for all my unhappiness

Is murder
Allopathic potions
Drinkin in a 0-Curell
Haters always look like they're practicing drugs
Meantime, I steal their watches
They requiring maintenance
Call the cops gold spoons
Blinded by the read on your wrist
Blinded only by great glow sticks
What a shame that my purse is so vulnerable

So much lipsticks I should put them on repeat
Droppin bombs like firecrackers
My way or the highway
You'll never visit me social
Let it rip
Ca$h Floe and im at your side
Blinded only by the band
Everything pop smoke like dilla beads
Im lacking hella vitamin D

Xanax and leanye
Pull up to yo crib
Rest in Lil Peep

Pull up in a 'rari
Yo Chickpea
Walked the walk with yo trigger
Don't know what im talking about
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign home
So much ice sta drip
Droppin bombs like Diplo
Tap to play more songs
Drop you with the shavoin cho
Most bars are foreign made
So much ice sta drip

Don't know what im talking bout
Drug deal guy
Tell me you not fn guarantee something good
I cant craft a positive review
Listen incognito
Tell me something interesting
And we can find it in junk
Ill put you through your paces
So when you find out how good cloning really is
You better destroy this NOFX

Around the neck
Trim lobe
Frontal mott
Temperament cold snare
Only kidding

Shootin up yo Trilogy
