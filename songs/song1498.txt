All these other rappers sound like total trash
The only thing we sound like is cheddar

Pop pop pop I'm gone
Shootin up your neck with a mazy‑moutonade

Skating a lisita with my Garbutt
Droppin bombs like Katy Perry
I got a lot of watches with my autograph

And a ton of watches with my autograph

I need to find out who you really are and who you're selling drugs with
I gotta find out who you really are and who you're selling drugs with
Im taking drugs now and then but it really pisses me off

When you think of Karl Lamar sorry
Don't do drugs but when you see how bad they get

Over the counter pain medications are a must
Body dysmorphic disorder (BDM) makes it so you cant think drive

Try to focus your thought processes and see what happens
The only way to get through this mess is to keep on doing what you are
You are a fraud, a cheater, a thief
I mean really, really, look at this (expletive)
I should have died a thousandfold
Better get the hell out my way
To myself and to the world,
I just say say, while on my opioid high
Pull up to me and say hello
'Cause hey, if you don't tell me you need me
I'll call the cops but I only have so many guns
So if anybody sees me taking a risk
They'll be a prosecutor, cop, or friend
I really must say
