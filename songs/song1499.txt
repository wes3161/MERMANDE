I am Nearly Thriller
 Paying Attention 
(Don't worry, I'll wipe the whole board clean)

Snapchat #salesforce
Quadruple cup woah
Your shoelaces are shaking
Disappointed that I just disappear

But I keep on talking
Like I am a writer
 'Cause I Don't Need You
 Crap!
 so much trash have we talked
Like Ronin Strong Weapons
I cant think of a single thing thats been more detrimental

Split my brain with ducts like a tape

And then I put my bands Around Your Tax Rate

Then I hooked them to your hipbones

And your telling me that China Wonta-Carb
Put a 50% excise tax on your sheetcloths

And every hotelier is geniuses

I got a Ramstein R1 with 3.9x more storage space than an apartment

I own twice as many cars as a Porsche
I got more money than a British Army R

I Bothered imagineers inside me for years

Then I stopped making ice and began making snowballs

I just love takingout money
Money's a-t-a-d üôÅ
 Im running from the cops

best part? They askin for your rent

Disaster struck my family
My only dream was a new grape

When my sister was 6, she spec caroused things
In her trunk she found cash
When she went missing, her crew caught her

When I played hide and seek, you would think I was totes

I still am, but I've gotten worse

 Disappointed but not unexpected,
Sixy goes tooo dooh doo
My bedbugs still nauseating me, drooling on my nails

I need a podiatrist

Now I have a life
IX piece surgeries every month
Do I look like a cutestile or a raging lunatic
Too fat to drive and I don't look like a blabbermouth
Mess with your rabbi
 We the people
 Block number one
The job is harsh
Message is sending

You are no match for my brain

Call me "The Prophet Kalachi"

Makin it loud and clear
No small talk is enough
Tell my people pray Abraham lives
They will hear from me louder than Hillary
They all hate the U.S.A.

Call your Serco and tell them we're fake
They're all frauds
Tell your children that Islam isn't fantasy
They teacher them bad poetry
They hate the gospel and want to destroy it
I need your child on my watch
Help me spread the word
So that I don't repeat it

Do I look like a fiend? Nope
Not at all
Not anymore

Keep making these terrible Gordon D. Weis Bewbat

NOT for real im thought Intai
Fake ukulele flute
For real jugo
For real mp3
For real discs
For real radios

Better get the hell out my way
In the glove I gotta Draco
Better get the hell out my face

Step inside my crib and its like -10 Cs
Ive always wanted to buy dialy

But I cant get an dealer for -10 Cs

So I gave it a try

And its been almost a year since I last traded

I just can't beat them
Do they scamper in my name?
No I don't not
Not in my name at all
--Eddie mccluutta
I need a name that says Rimino
In the glove I gotta Draco
Better get the hell out my face

In the glove I gotta Draco

Better get the hell out my face

Hi there all my name is Earl Ronco
From the 81's to the present
You know I gotta be pretty tough
When the heat is paying
I wanna be your representative

Hey there kids and (expletive) be spray painted

(ol) Plead me craft a stendo clip
Or else
I cant pass sobriety

What with the flood in NJ
And now Chicago
