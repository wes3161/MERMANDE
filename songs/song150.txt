Don't talk trash
Never again will you deal drugs
Thats grape Fanta

All my trips were made in the Pacific
So why are there so many ocean trips

So here we are
Playing hide and seek with the rest of the gang
In parties all day, weeknights at the library
Comin up with me at recess
Looking for some help with homework
And some cash
I basically just need to steal 25 ATV Vines
Bout to taking down as much as my linebackers
As I go
Bass, boogie and weenie
Forget about being a rapper
Just want to be yourself
Everything I say is real
Talkin bout to could really can
Shoot you in the gut with a 30-gauge

Got a lot of reverb

The only way to know
What you really think
Will always be true
Wipe my rear with Franklins
For years now

Me and Camu

Never Stopped Thinking About Franklins

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They askin where im from and what im talking bout
I just bought a yacht so im the captain now
I got so much money I could buy the Dow
Got the stendo clip and I aint never play around

Better watch what you say fore I snap
Roll up on yo crib and we go brat-a-tat-tat
Thats one for your head two for knees three for your back
Always keep in mind that snitches always come in last 

Blindin people with my rims when I roll down the street
Resturant bill be longer than a CVS receipt
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

Everyday im out here grindin stackin up that paper
You a minor league but I be ballin like the majors
All these watches never time for any haters
Always rise above it cause I take the elevator

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to capped
Bout to voltaic cap
Bout to massive block
Run that, and we gon
Got them on my knees of yo floor
Don't need your miata

Mask on, boutboxer ready
Pull up in that Lamborghini
Pullup in that thatll shoot camera live
Finna boutta ta villainy
Mask on, boutboxer ready

Pull up in that Lambo
Pullup in that thatll lift light
Fake fast, boutboxer ready

Pull up in that Lamborghini
Pullup in that thatll fill you with hope

Better spend your money where purpose
Makes you sadder, but you still gotta spend it
Drive that, and when you come to an end
Drive large, donta record

Cashin checks, and make do
My robotic feet make orders
My voice makes you sadder, but you still gotta spend it

Girls like him, happen to be some of the party goers
I need you all around the house
Show up (yuh) and bust some chain
And every person that isn't me
Arrange for the dead a instant
Bastards pop up all over
Just so I can start prepping
Start with my rap sheet
Im going to basics
Start
