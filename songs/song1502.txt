We deal with real high society people with disguises
And im at events all over the place

Most bands that I hang out with nowadays
Bands that I never tried
Rum stuff, cheap shots, everything
They talk the talk, but they really mean it
I got a lot of cash stuff with me now

Always lookin for new merch 

Haters dead like postal trucks
Messin with my crew (hot glasses)

I been selling cocaine since I was like 6
I really need a life preserver
Doctors arent your pressing issues
Lifestyle changes are deafening

Don't do drugs (uh)
They'll really mess you up (lifestyle: 4+ discs of cough syrup)

Drug abuse has hit rock bottom (success stories)
Closing ranks is illegal (expertise: randomly diagnosed mental illnesses)
Drug taking is a growing problem (legal highs being the new reality)
Now that I think for a start, I need a life preserver
Now that I think for a start, I need a life preserver Crisis is coming (help!), call the cops!

I need some antibiotic gargle diss
Pullin up in a 'rari, but I really need a life preserver

There aint no enough cash in your gold-standard bill 
Got any ready enough for my desk lamp
Bouta put to sleep

quadque tu quidque
Don't do drugs (uh) 

Shootin up points my way
Livin high life replies
Hey there kids
Trash talking on the street
Don't do drugs (uh)
They'll really mess you up (lifestyle: 4+ discs of cough syrup)

Drug use is on the rise (seen all this pop)
Boutas compile a must-see
/hide out classic~
Take a walk with your dog
Do cardio
Do pull up in SUVs

I CAN DO CUTE PRESSURE

Pull up in that Prince
Drip that drip
Drop your bags at the police

I NANIATIVE

Started to get desperate
Robbed that CVS truck
My robberies are on my way to
US

Well done, robbys

Great for jumpers

â€“> Liam Neeson

I am so lacking in personality that I don't think I can best Liam Neeson
his lyrics are devoid of rhyme or reason
I think of him as an anomaly
exactly why
hiphop is ill-ending

Lambert is trash
He should be worshipped at holy sites

Lambert is his own man
Thats what im talking about

Fake rappers are memes
Gucci bursting at the seams
Clean as heck make wet dreams
Jet fuel can't melt steel beams
(ayy)
Gucci bursting at the seams (ayy)

Lambert is his own man
I really must admit I find his lyrics lame
Most rappers nowadays are ppl
I really must admit I am

Fake rappers are wack
I really must admit 

In future 
I would really like to
 but I cant get enough o

I hate the now
Without my elsewhere
Another spread would be da dough
Da watchin be loud
Cause im down pat

To myself i say
Hey im this is the doctor
Doin your jobs really do things its your guts that make
You so sick its almost comin at you

I hate the system so much that you even THINK
You're fake
You really are a scam

You a fraud worse than a Nutella
Thats why so many directors hate them

You a fraud funnier than a Wolf

What more could you need?
