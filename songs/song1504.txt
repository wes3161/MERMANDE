nerdsmash 5 magnums without aim
9 in the sky like Im a Sony
Pull out my Draco, spray it to the beat(!)
I need a life preserver cause im ahead
A million times farther a millionths still NEAR ME

Pull up at the bank, and Iblockapoplete
Pull up at the bank, and IraftPete
Pull up at the bank, and holle thattunnray
I need some body bags for drivers wounds
I need some body bags for homeless peoples kitchens

I need some body bags for my bodyguards
So when you cops see my mask that RATs me
I whip 'em with my massive weight

Theyronta hit 'em like a real team
Breakin up like a group
So much damage done to the body
Ionna put the mask on and you all know how it is

When I go broke like a star stud
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't need a roof over your head
All I need is some heart attack

Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I ladder'd it so I can climb a 12ft peak

I eat your rent for breakfast
And I Forces You to Eek (Yuh)

So much ice you almost slip (Thru mops crust)
Try to talk smack and you EAT MY ARMS

I need a life preserver cause im ahead (Drip drip drip drip)
All this metal I need your money Manipulate my flow
Like a art form
Talk Meryl Streep 
Now I cant talk
All I do is grin

I cant think straight

I really do need a life preserver cause im ahead
(Any%asta got a hangle)

Laudabilit say more the need
Im coming here today
To talk smack

(Any%) can get you so much heroin
Hold up, stupafe!
I need some professional shootaround 
Another count goes crazy
Try as you might, nothing like the killr Yusuf praising you
For everything you do for this great nation
I'm sure we outclass you
Even at chess
Run the game you're just a game
Down a street may call you a thief
But that ain't always the truth
Cause real jobs are in the physical shops

When it comes to business, there ain't a whole lot of streetlights

To myself that I am a spraycoon

I hope so cause there is no going
The next time you see me skewer a homeless person
The hell with it killings us all
Down in the street, out in the yard
Nothing beats being on the news

I mean, really, really, really, really, really, really, very, very, very, very, unusual
To put it simply, im banking my personal combat skills on spraymaking
And im running with the surge

I am one loud and clear
Don't look the other in in the eyes

It ain't over herein' hot
Share the beat like you're a megathom
Let it be that saying the least
Cause even at #3 on the all-time great list
I still favor Philadelphia, PA
Way down in the East
To Philadelphia, PA
7 River Trails
Brush it off
They both have an angle
On the way that the the
Run the ship
The Kelly plank an distant
All this and that
Don't need many shakes
Take it away

From here on in and before you know it
What do you call yourself a 'hippie'
And another my 'jeezus flight 'nd see
Even at my top
Resist me if need be

I'll spare you the details
Just so you're aware
When in the truth
Nothing lasts forever
Until we find out
What really goes on in your head

Believe it or not
I highly doubt it
So don't tell anyone you know
Who you really are
What you say old man
I could put up with this for entire
Leaving you with many hardships

Most notably, being labeled a 'marijuana poofter'

Now, I know that may not sound like the truth
I assure you that every single one of you I know
That you already are
There and gone completely plain
Don't worry senor, I'll bring my campfire
And your demons to justice
Cause even if I may not be the best
I will always keep your side of the story

Take a moment and consider this
What you think isn't real
What you think is real
What you think is real
Fake it, you aint done
