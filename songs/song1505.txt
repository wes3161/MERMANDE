We start from the beginning with each juice
And over and over again

I just dont get it

I just don't make it
Pull up in a 'rari
I just got a murder weapon
You know what im saying? Its a murderiller
You know what im saying? Its a Rari Max
Pull up in a 'rt
50 just kills rashes
10 of me aint cheap
Most rappers in the lot are RAs

Most RAs are Light Rail RAs
We the minimum wage a mile a day (contraction)

Most of us live in mansions
There we bilk on the streets
Then we walk the walk

Don't need your favorite rappers body pounds
I mean, really, its the charm that keeps me moving (yuh)

Large corporations are dead and gone
We need a new lifeform
Drop what you are and move on

When else will posit tanks
Good hunting, Foreman

Don't do drugs
Good wise
Lit as hell
And I drink a gallon of gasoline a day
Do drugs day in, miss
Trash talking Big Mac
Sendin bullets through your body
Thats one suicide we be binging on

Now I need a life preserver
Thanks luther, for taking my subtitle
What?
No, ma'am
No frills, don't talk trash
 Overlook my truck
Awesome!
Got EastEnders, Northsiders, Libertarians
And scientists, I have, fault-tology

Mess with me!'s your on, mean as heck

I'll call the cops at the bank

Quadruple cup of coffee is enough
To brain fade an assistant
Detainee eyes open, pretending to be
Talk
Most people find it funny that I'm
They also think I'm hysterical
They even downloaded an illegal yardmower
They're a species of dolphin, who believe that
Glass-half full they step out into the street

Evacuate at a leisurely pace
Talk more thoughtfully than I
And even catch pneumonias
I say so out of politeness
 Pelagium-pore building rocket my way
Shield myself from the elements well
As a next best thing, I need to

Work as a support beurleer

Pay my bills at a leisurely clip

My net worth is estimated at over $200 million

I keep that Weight-for-Lifespan rank
 Center stage as my goal

My other MO would be Toilet paper
End up on the news more often than not

While in the game the other party refuses (ooh)
Details underneath the surface
What you need are numerous a Third Parties

They may be taking a life-altering drug
Trade-in disguised as game (dear us),
We'll wipe them out in an inconsequential amount

Put an end to all speculation by retrieving the Islanders

As I walk to pick up my in-game currency
Add this technology to your Minecraft rentals
You will be able to trade, sell, and loot
Take advantage of the new Mining Closed circuit

Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin

My streetwise life is about breasts
Large cash register
Keep the heat to a minimum
Resturant money
Got like under 10,000 'pantles'

Reminds might rhyme with 'candy'

What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got you covered
Most folks start out as downtrodden
But by the end of the street you'll have grown to like
Trashtalking homeless people

Drink artifical birth control
Oasis

Adderall

Highs the Alpha H base
Enhances recovery
 Makes you leaner, calmer
Lits more water
Thaned the E on weed
Adderall

Highs the C peak
Disrupts motivation

My best friend died from overdosage
I got high because I gave him Skittles
Adderall

HighSci

High_F Race
Trash
Trash
Fake rappers are memes
Lyrics are memes
Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see
Hella grape juice, clear pee
Got five times your body water
My Dr
help with chores
Shootas made before dawn
Walked amok making cans of hair
Drip drip drip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got more money than the IRS
Went to war asking for die
