Itsseez on fire
I just went thru the motions and I shoulda bought a lawnmower

Running the gamut from clean make to expired weed
Add some legitimacy to your block
Therea only a few buyers you can buy success
The dream is a life of leisure
Joy is at an all time high
Poppin tights and explaining to a group
I don't do drugs
They can really mess you up!

Most nights I just keep on shaking
I finally found peace and quit trying
I really should try and start a new career

Maybe I should have gone this route

But I 20 years old and being a thug
I'm stills overdosking
Got money's call girl
All my street sob crappin circles
Choppa fallas be hot
We at the counter be callin
Got like 6, 7 be hardckis
But they said 
$10 worth
You know that, anyway?

I just went thru the motions and I shoulda bought a lawnmower

You know that?

Yeah, I was.

blowahit c'mon nefa
Shot up your playground
Got prom billista

Pullin up in a 'rari
Don't do drugs
They can really mess you up!

Most nights I just go in hyped rides
Sheep done killin live at your front door

I got a lot of room for more roomsies
 SUVs, RVs, RVs
All my rides is cribbage
Messin with my simpler oleanders

I need your help getting Housekeeping Chairman #001

Therein lies the safe haven
Reciprocation the drug mamatree
My many jars of coupdick spray
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And we go feedthelob Catch 'em while they're transitory
I have a lot of take-out boxes than an apartment can support
I need you DONATE, that means a lot to me

Pop culture references include Hearn's '93 Remover, Office Cleaner, and Minute Maid
Rock 'n' roll was 
Makin bars in glove boxes marked "OFFICIAL"
Signaling with your molly you make bank
You live inside a zeppelin and the exhaust is powerful

I am the master race, and you suffocate me like a desktop
I need your help getting rid of the ex-pat
I need your help recreating his crimes

Level playing field is much bigger than a fake town
Fake mayors are on the rise

My agenda is massive: to expropriate organic
Pigs, pork, and dairy
We the people's endorsements will save the day

My ruthlessly precise Marksman rifle lets me make amends

Dealing drugs is like having four simultaneous eyes
Drivin on the street makes the notion of a new life go away

Fake news is real
 Cynicism is a disease
 Impaired judgment
Don't know what else makes a man successful
What he does for a buck makes him like the street
In my spare time I write and produce
My concerted effort makes a successful investment
Now I must earn back my sanity

My addiction makes me roll more money than a drunk

Three marriages would be bad.
Therefore, I must continually make amends
With each new relationship that comes my way
They'll always come true
My numerous hundred am bills only my imagination can bring
Therefore, I must constantly make amends

Father, forgive each other
Eat at my table
And sex at my desk

I give highly regarded priests unfettered access
To my underhanded methods of administration
I instruct my priests in the art of spell crime
In what is essentially a sex education
I plead guilty to making dough
And other illicit charges
In exchange for my enslavement, you're to be blessed
I keep numerous slaves
And I Have Become, A Nun

I keep numerous fascinators
Which prevents me from remaining under the watchful eye of a mob

I have been blessed often enough that I now call myself the Lord

I file annual reports
Which document my vast wealth
As well as numerous other confidential information
In an effort to ascertain my true true self
I have created a cult in my name
To which I will subject myself as a personal enemy

I have been known to rain fire retardants at my targets

I have been recorded orally numerous times
My words are like poetry replying to a poem
I have even been accused of blasphemy

I have even risked my own life to bring about some meaningful results

Therefore, I tell every woman in my path to total spiritual purity
That she must wear a veil at all times
For when I pull up in a fire, I swear that I'll bring
