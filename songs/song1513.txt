All this rambling you piece
I could write more text
All this trash you piece
My brain just explodes if I don't convince
Led with a molly Irs blade
Not enough space in my stalk
Everything I say sounds like poetry
Large metal eaters my head
I need a life preserver

Hamsterdam brittle like steel
Give it a whirl
Drive me to and fro

Fake pics cause death by lasers

Okkafka there (skkrt)

Livin loose that girl fear button down
Im triggered so hard that I cant rip a sheet
Im running an auto drill at my front door
Handcuffed my ex at gunpoint
Got a latin hip that I keep track of
My life is a continuous drip
Every day amazes me

Three beef chucktamas prevail
Hungry for some throats and spleens

I need to bring down the swine famine
Adrift on a draco-nut cruise
Droppin at the 'ry back home
Trash talking his way to slimming it
I need to come clean with my crew
Father forgive them, for they know not who they are
They sharks are our archbishops
We humans are merely animals and do not deserve the name
They tell the truth, for they know best
They are off focusing on themselves
They are deficient in vitamin D
