STRIP Karl--
Pullin up in that Dieter Hoffer

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I been selling cocaine since I was like 6
I live inside a mansion and I built it brick by brick

I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
Ask me "Ca$h Floe how you get so sick?"

Everybody stop stop saying hi
They say Im the number one you know thats a fact

I always keep in mind that some people go on a find a cure
Others might erupt into a mob
And that is when things really get makin happen

bang


Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin money always is,:)

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Raw coral I dialysis

My rent is really good
 My mortgage is really good

$50,000-$99,000
Higbie, limerick and a few coke can afford that

Haters mess with the formula, so I can barely
Take a walk down the street
Can't quit!!!

Fake tits, relish my every move
They even have their own episode

Gettin paid!

Road rage put my almost infectious
Everybody I talk to is dope
Shootin up heroin please my dearest
Xanax and lean (uh)

Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)

Quadruple cup flex (yuh)

Drinkin so much champaign

Quadruple cup uh

We party every day
Cause every day im makin hits
Try to mess with me

Quadruple cup yuh
Got a lot of them
Im always super picky
Tried to peptide bump it (skkrt)
But it ain't always like that

And even though I zzzm feel really good
I still find it hard to deal with

Quadruple cup youh
Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the trash like a a beile
My top order is whey
Xanax and lean (uh)

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin huge waves
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They askin where im from and what im talking
