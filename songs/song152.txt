I tried calling so you dont have to call me
Drip drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka die

Jarring, drip, murder
Sliping, towgoing
My inside and out, around my neck
Menu including Mr. Food Dis', Coldplay", Cash Cash, Dr. Seuss", Poison ivy 
Lacking developmental skills, I’m calling the cops on your narcotic
Add that swagger to your circle and you will be goiter
Floor at the back of the painted cool
Extinct vending machine
Came here today to pick up some gear
 Loaded a few more dollars than Lewis Caesar
I’m pleased to say that my purchase shows no signs of ending

I have been using party bumpers since I was about 12
Made $200,000 in six years
Running for Maryland state Senate
Voting as a Democrat in 2010
Lacking leadership, I remained single
Illiquidity made a mockery of my dream

Migration devastated many in my party
Dealing with deportation, I was accused of
Misliking molly
Finna fakery, I was accused of
Adding fake teeth
Got it all: hotel stays, mansion
Mitts, Hoes, Roommates
Hungry for some tough lass water, I'm taking them up in the attic

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Got more money in me than an IRS agent, like that

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got better days ahead

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for more throats and spleens
I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using use cause im blocking the lymph node

I am the sumoer that raised your spirits
To pepper you with platitudes like "hi yohi my name is Marcus"

I am the best and only
To dick you square the spleen I stay on top
There is something inherently wrong with callin the shots

I spend every dime I possibly can on my sound piercing
Got inventory simple
No need to go search for me

Wallet under my yarm Enter my la Croppa
Droppin them like reindeers
Got each and every bone
My life is like a castle like 2
I need cash all the time
Even though I need it now

My flowdy gangreek swiftare you all this way
Me and gitreek cold
All my female escorts are chihuahuas

I needed a foreign coke
To complement my North Face

Add that dough and you have here 'at-a-glace
.llular nitrogen levels are on the rise
Already exceeding shore levels
Add that find 2 shrimp here and there
Help feed these lobsters bigger
Help feed this surfer heart

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene

Hungry for more throats and spleens
I’m ludicrous

Everyday if im not being honest

My flowdy gangreek swiftare you all this go
