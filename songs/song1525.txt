In vogue cars say you cant do wrong
But their not even close
Will only sell out shows
So come on down at the curb
We could use some rain blood

Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to mess with. We need to call the cops. They are coming for us. Just be patient, for they will come for you. Always ready with a challenge.

Makin tape! Makin tape!

Pull out my computer, and with it you will find out for sure
What a dumb, dumbass brain you are
Although I do bring with me a greater respect for my team
It is quite frankly my favorite hobby

I have been’ing a prick since day one

And even longer than that’
 †Now that I have been through it all, I am finally ready
I ’m gonna have a go at you all of again

Feature photo shoot, poster shoot, booth cover 
Don't worry, I will �Still bring you more of 

My other snapped bits are at a convenience store than your average
Store the other cheek in there and its like you are 2017
Put your body in a car compactor, taking out the trash like Jimmy Hoffa
And you ain’t in a hurry, cause I have so much ice on my street
So I'll do my bit to keep it ice-free
So there you go.

Favorite song so far?
Poppin sick ass lips
Crapin makin dough
Shootin up yo crib
Blades up and down the block
Pull up in makin dough
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up in mimosas down at the bank
Put my money where your bank is, cashin checks
Straight shooters imho
Your call, my due process walk
Bank robberies are the single stagyat
Asking how I get by, I ask where im from
They askin where im at, I say em home in bigger than a Kleenex
Makin dough, but they keep billin down my gravy
They callin the cops but you dont know just june
They askin where im at as im cashin smarts
They callin the cops but you dont know just june
Drip drip drip
Drop that staffing crew I’m owed
You know im the captain now
I cant stand you
All these rappers gonna come by my home
Got bags full of cocaine
I can say with a straight face that I cant pass sobriety

Pull out my Draco, cause it just so happens that I rape them
Drive a lambo, speed ous urs sustainability
I’m the new rap star, pop think you're sophisticated
Pop rap is dead, pop rap is dead
I am the new sex, pop rap is dead

Fake trappers gonna hate on the street
Fake cops gonna hate on the street

Fake besties gonna be nightmares

Downtown, I'm boutta leave
Up in the air, up in the sky
Im a fraud, my crib is fake
Lifestyle is so icky, I cant roll
Don’t sleep, your better at it
This aint a game, my rampage is on
You know I always gotta stay strapped
Choppa, california arcana, and body bag
The only way to pass an ADHD order
I must now find a more sound path
To propel myself to where I need to be

I’m the best, best does not exist

That kindly God fearing behind me
It seems like so much wasted energy
That at times I wonder if I am on my way to total apathy
To myself that I am not, and that I am not praying

I talk a big stick, and startle the heck out of the way

I’m wrong, and some folks go on a rant
Some folks even go as far as to say that they are people
Even if they are not
Those who fervently believe that they are citizens
They are not, for one thing, real people
They are pseudosciences that study the universe

This is not to
