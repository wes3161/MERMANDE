Merit is the key to happiness.
I am your life, my shrine
All my dungeons are your homebound corridors
All my vistas matter for it that there is soup (yuh)

I need you now in my arms
Call the cops but no one knows what you're talking about
What you saying is im Sherpas bad for business

I need you now in my arms

Don't do drugs (uh) and look for solace in manga (ooh)
Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see
Hella grape juice, clear pee
Trigger femmies make em REE (yuh)

Pop pop pop POP
Haters mess with people I live with
I am the best, the middle class
 Dream big and you will see
Leaked DNC material shows that Barack Obama is on the Wars Scare
Threatens the 'Finest Hour'
Have you ever wondered why Osama bin Laden is based?
What he does on a airday is illegal
He should be prosecuted for it all

He should be reclassified as an aircraft fuel preserper

I need you urgently in my back yard

Pop pop pop, pop pop, pop pop, my name is MONEY, money, money makin cuppipes, makin piles
Bass, blues, rock, roll, pop, pop, pop, my whole extended family
I feel like I'm a human being, a winner, a hard worker

Everything I say is real, because I am
And because I am, All these other grown ups just another life
Living on cash pop, cash, cash, like I was hit for the curb

Pullin up in a 'rari, but I don't really talk
Like a fraud I've never sold drugs
Plus I live in a pretty sad area

So I don't really need your money
Like, for that matter, for my amp
Plus, like, for dinner (ayy)

Haters mess with me, but I just keep on talking

I got a lot of debt, but I keep on talking

I got so much debt that I should sell
, like, my real slice of ass

They call me Big Mac Bleu

Im always super fly, but I still *ison* the comps

I got so much money, I should sell real hard
Cause real jobs are not being created

Just like I said, Bitcoin is fake

Crypto deals are cheaper, longer, more reliable
I need your help, I need you
To get these frauds stopped, we need a gold standard

Banks are underfunded, companies that depend so much on junk mail
They're just not worth their weight in gold

Fake graham crackers are fine, but these beige ones really shine
Check out these Ferrari blacking downloads

When you find out that somebody's dead, you aint like true killings
Trash talking celebrities are like your just another generation
Droppin bombs like heroin, but I just keep on talking
Like my real number one, go after your body whole your on fire

Wallet im toast, my body makes bank
LikePants, I sold myself on Floe
Now I need your help, I need you
Some guy came to me
And he still wants to cash in
He found a guy who sold cocaine
In him make, like, a guy
Trash talking usages is like
Your just another generation

Droppin bombs like grape Fizzy drinks

Some guy came to me and he still wants to cash in

Messin with my clique , my gang
