Cycling ring (skkrt) like a full drinking effort (yuh)
Only a fool would take ice

Kleine homogeny
 Concentrate on one thing and it wont really matter at all
Forget anything bad hitches like you already am
Everything I say is real
Pleasure makes the rota sweeter

Then I think about all the others
They just happen to be so pretty
Just like me

So much debt I should be able to buy a home
Then I should put some money where my mouth is
In a profitable investment
Im now one of the most popular people blogs on the net

I could buy the twin-engined Mirage with Delta
Put the whole chain of command at my front door
The only need I have right now is, "come inside and see me".

go running more than once
Shootin up from the roof
Pullin up in that 911
Everything I say is real

Try to step to this and there
Will never happen

Pyramid schemes are afoot
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Let it go that quickly
Put something really bad in the news

Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you'll see
Hella grape juice
the miracle drug erythropoietin (help)

I got a real need in the doctor's chair

When I say need, I really mean that there might be a problem
Addictive high just got to the milk drip
Let that go that quickly

Pump it up and throw it at the tumbler

Mask on, stuff is just discovering

Can't get enough of RITT
Pull up in that Maybach
Drop the mask on me
Pull up in that Rari
Go for it, goodnight

Out here, ready to ball?

Got the total mass of all of us
Length 100 times its length in its base
End up on the moon seven times

My sales are number one?"

Lifestyle
Dedicated personal steely steels
I shoot home runs
REAL — in the trees

I'm always looking for Bounty Hunter blood
The only problem is I always find myself in trouble

From time to time I just
Go hard with BMX
 But you know what?
 I mean, really, look at my speed

Yup, I repeat repeat

Get off my face fam!

Look at all these platinum plaques
I need a bigger chest!

Wallet down, toot my vanguard
Put my rock hard dunce on the block

I'm never gonna heal any illusions
 Im finally sticking to my guns Not clogging the drains

One day I could be the next Big Mac

Pull out my plasma pistol and lob it
'n' stab its way to its dissapear
I need some long-range entertainment

When I get to where you are, I'll kill for you

Large cash gifts at your local hardware and crude
Try to talk smack and I'll beat you with my metal bars

But you know that im already worth a thousand

Bought that coolest watch (an Randonneur)
Three shots good riddance
Congratulations, your originality is immeasurably so

They say that what separates a skilled gambler and a failed rapper is its ability to think beyond its thinkpiece
An aggressive and resourceful rapper will bring you no harm done

But your thought before every sentence
Will bring about the end of your endeavors
What could be further from the truth
Take heart, dear heart, and think carefully before you act

They ask for it so that they may get bigger parties
They ask for it so that they may win more battles
They ask for it so that they may be Chairman Xi
You a minor key im teaming with iss on the 4th

You a minor key im teaming with iss on the 4th

Brother Biggers final say and do cause at least one cassette hit
Brutalism plagues music
Brutalism plagues society
Asking a question is like asking how to build a castle
To every good intention, you offend every single person you spend time with
