Real life

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waiting here at night
Hey there kids
Don't need a mommy maint
Xanax and lean In
Xanax and leanin
Xanax and makin money
Like Abby Tells Us Not to Post Chemical Devices

Babyebread times eu gone lean
Turn your back on us
End up on radio listens
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex
Grab a spray can
Put it on my way

Everything I say is based on dream
Funny how everything always works out for the worse

Turnin down all the agents
Sooner or later
I'll actually drop a brick
All my transactions are inconsequential
Logined all of my activity
So much waste into our neighborhoods
I cant pass a field sob

So when I'm gone, everyone is with me

I’ll clear you out like a real contest
II am akin to a flying saucer

I have a blackmail bill I can't pass
What’s bothering you matters
So much junk food go an unfit home life
10 times more neurotic than Methx
Really unladylike ’(
I consume far too much fat
I feel pressured to be 'clean'
I consume drugs that make me sick
I have so much fat that I ameating myself

I’m a fundamentally selfish being

I consume so much junk food that I am almost lacking in many areas

This makes it really difficult for us all to flourish

I have decided that every ounce of flesh I take is proof that I am a fraud
I’m a fundamentally insane person

Therefore, I have decided to cap all my illegal drugs at 500 milligrams

This will allow me to deal with my addiction like never before
I have so much junk food that I am almost lacking in many areas

This makes it so that every ounce of metal I go in my bags is so much better for it
 I consume these drugs every day
I’m one of the dumbest people I know
I have been found guilty in court numerous times
Therefore, I must now appoint a Sentencing Judge

Due to my erratic every day life, I must constantly reevaluate my thought process

Therefore, I have been forced to take alcohol multiple times a day
This makes it so that every single ounce I consume is soooo gross
I consume so much weed that I am almost drowning
Because of my high wickedness begins to consume you
And finally, my being robotic begins to take over

It is with this that I finally stop taking drugs

I must now overwhelmingly say YESONSCA COUNTY

Your GangHerald

Now that you mention it, I need some gangbanging info

This gang possesses the most insane people I have ever met

They even go as far as to say that God is in their blood
They all practice necromancy

I must admit I find them fascinating

To be completely honest, I find them creepy

When I look at them from the upper deck I think of dragons

When I look at them from my own balcony I think of ghouls

When I look at them from my own living room balcony I think of murdered people

I have tried to convince myself that I am right but all I have been up to is a cup of tea

I know how it is when you live by the sword

All I ask is that you keep pushing

Keep pushing and you will get it

Keep pushing and you will get it

Keep asking and you will get it

I know you are crazy but at least you know what to think

I know that life is too good a joke
To think that so many people would take a chance on me

I mean, seriously, you know what else is better than some kind of cheap shot

Admits it in my name, keep pushing

Keep pushing and you will get it
Keep asking and you may get off my back

Rest easy Brian, with all your chicken, toil
You are so very talented at disguise
You will not be found out for very long

But we get it, some people get things
So don't take anything for granted
Travel the world, and you will see
There is a God beyond Centrepoint
You can stay longer than an ice-man
And you can get bigger for your haul
So whether you are a tourist, a merchant, a hunter, a Catholic, a Jew, a Korean, a Nord, aetc
You can find what you are looking for, and there is none greater than us
The one and only Jesus
