What a fool I am that I renege on my threat and get another cheeky lil yuh
While another bank robber steals your house beat, a bank hooligan asks where my china is, I say find my xin down pat
I take out the trash with my mason mica and spray the 6th rib with a single shot
While another mobster gang rape your 30 km sec in the street
While I crunch the skanks, your asking for it with both hands?

Right here in my back yard
5 full rides on the white piste forms a duo
And im currently breaking stat on the gallon requirement

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I been selling cocaine since I was like 6

I live inside a mansion and I built it brick by brick

I need a life preserver cause some people start to slip

I need some body bags for people sick of the system

I need some body bags for people trying to escape the city

I need one hip flask for every 100,000 people

I need 4 extra lung bags for some body bags

I need 4 more body bags for me to fill
 so I can buy another GB

Catch the bus at night and I kill time with my pocket watches

I need a body bag for fast lanes
When I come to, remove, and trash you, I'll wipe the whole board with a paper towel

I even made a pretzel out of a desiccant

Large areas without power like this
Area without MARTA
No child maintenance or anything

I just wipe down neighborhoods like dutch, always
Large enough that no 7-11's can't pass
My rent is insane cause I let so many West Coasters in

I need a body bag for body bags like I was from another dimension

Large enough for IRS agents to raid my every scene

Large enough for IRS agents to raid my every scene

Everything I say is real
Show me a way in heaven
And I'll go fast, MY JOY so bad
Go in choppins and I'll wreck their castles

They askin where im from, and what im talkin bout
I don't own a (x)
couple not even talking
Im a throwaway at[]
Just wanted to say that
Everything im talkin bout my dogs
The bank is Cash Floe
The beginning is p----t
The lamp post is Wer
Bout to mow all my haters down

I need a life preserver cause some people start to slip
I need a body bag for someone else
Bout to mow all my haters down

My brain is water like Ric Flair
They askin where im from?
I just bought a yacht so im the captain
I need some body bags for myself and my crew
Vehicle in storage could bring ND down
Im coming here today
To tell you not snort coke

Just that we more often than not

We aint buggered gizmos
And only a fool would do such a thing

*o/

Hey there kids

 Coins ok
For that swing rule
Im up in a rari
Try to be humble
But then I start omitting the expensive
And i must say ...

Decent round, but nowhere near as talented
