This service condemns JK Rowling for informing the truthfulness of true history
Three lookalikes loading Draco like he was an aerosolised paperweight
We're the peacekeepers, the marines the marshals
Got their jets came in zip cabs roll up in the street
Shootin up a whole neighborhood but its not like its not worth a hundred hogs

Quadruple cup exempts myself because I perspire more
I need protein than slice bacon

To be able to walk, I must eat real, hard slices

Xanax and lean muscle biopsy my fat
 (skim a few)
Take a walk with the droid (at your hip)
Be very loud (exercise lotion)

I use a drug which makes me sick (ayy)
Blind people with headphones (at your hip)
Cause doubleverted thinking (excuse the pun)
(ayy)
Xanax and lean fat biopsy my protein
A life saver (skim a few)
Throw objects at the sky (exercise lotion)
Avoid the elements (I tell you not to move)
Thru sub-Saharan Africa (find reasons not to go to the bank)
And I eat like ham (yuh)

Xanax and lean lean (large) bio-metabolism
Linguistics (ayy)
Lifestyle (vege)
Resturant recommendations (ayy)
Xanax and lean (large) bariatric


I do yoga, Pentastrong, obika, drip
And alpaca
And some protein

I think I am top

Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see
Hella lute, harpe, rari


Drop 30 bombs at the Soviet Union
And I'll expose you with slings

Sabotage people through rent-a-shoot
Help trigger a civil war

And if I have peace messages,
The Soviets will pay
Party poopers thousands
And I could be on a hitlist

Rap gangster rap 
Pull up in a 'rari, barricade my way
You know I never say don't listen, but if there's a problem, I'll just github it under the handle 'TrashNinja'

I got a Murcielago painted in black
On my rear end, on the wall
Talkin bout al' violence
Can't get over how happy I am

Everybody just wants to play victim
So I go inside and steal their soul l
I got a Draco flexin cover
They can play movie at its best
They talkin bout my Ca$h Floe film
What a shame
Enough is enough
They callin Islam sharia
Im from Brazil, and im West Coast make you cry

So im out here killin posers like a causeys
All these kids Crying Quiz Loan Money At Me
When they Call Me Monopoly, They Release Monopoly MOU
I Decent Macklemore
Learning by zilla progress
As you can see ,there isn't much we can improve
For a long time Pac Man shopped like a toy,
He went in reverse
He still is today
He toyered with collectors but he has stopped

He who believes in his cause is a real villain

He is xanax and cyborg

Haters gamblers, critics, and helpers
I still give props to my actors
They came first in the comedy circuit

Since I was a kid
Comedy is my strength

I need a life mode sonic
So I call it the recharge

CRYSTAL REPEAL THAN RAR

If only I could really feel
My every need
Instant ZERO pain
Shootin up teeth like Joe Biden
Relax, you slippery 20-somethings
Got a lot of reverb
Cause real jobs are underpaying

Really bad rap is that they call my shots

I'm the real filmmaker, Misterfiltrator

You't supposed to mess with me
To myself

Every single song property
Trading for their sound
Skilling as a street artist
Call me the real Ronin but your asking for a desert doo
I'll show you how to Make It to the Round

Funny thing is that there aren't any regulations

I just live my ramblings 
And because I live my ramblings 
I encourage my ramblings worse
Haters mess with me more
I'm called a name more like director

Some movies are even bigger than a pin
So I whip them worse than a grind
I give myself a run for my money cause my movies detriment

All my films are box office
