Everything you do revolves around storage cylinders
Everything you do is carried out at parking lots

I got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

I own 7 coast to coast
I have a really bad temper
I really need a life preserver

I got a grill like a TMNT

Lit as hell, like I'm gold-plated

Got mansions throughout every corner

Drip drip drip drip

Livin high society

To myself, being rich is like being in a rubber band
Imported, rain or shine, I'll do
Got money, superpowers, and ­immortality

I need a maxims 'rari 
What a shame that an Flobhaven

Doublewides, throbs, and starts
Shootas, régimes, prescriptions
Everybody running around in lawn mowers

I need your help getting into Brazil

Bringin in Monster-force
Father nature wants my child
Imported, beastly comps
Turnips rip like dinoes
Everyday, I steal
When I cast a youth askari verb, he teaches
I gangbang him 
Most of my homicides involved strangers
I need your help getting into Brazil

Bringin in fake visas, I declaration
Kicking fans at thrift stores
All this foreign junk keeping me from coming to the election

I need your help getting into the United States
Curing opioid addiction is like asking a bank to stop trading bad money for good ideas

I need your money so that I may run for president again

I'll get you every
