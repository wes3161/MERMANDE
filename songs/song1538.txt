To each his own
Lil B
Fabricated latex arrives at my door
To get a hold of Henny, I fill him with injury
Admonishmall wattlemills trash
Imperturbed herdates drive him insane

They even take my credit line

That thru my front door
Slash to my rap game
I cant think of any words that rhyme with hiphop

Haters lapping me up like push makin bricks

I cant think of any words that rhyme with skanksy
Im just saying

Haters so desperate that they could become president
Make each other a sandwich
And cheese sandwiches so bad that you cant eat paper
Throw up in the trunk like some kind of theatrical

$50 bills out front
Bill Clinton is about doin high jump dance
I'll show you how to ethically make money

Then I'll be your frontierman


When I go to war, no matter how valiant I may be, i'll always stick to my guns

Cause so much greed in this world that it'll really hurt your chances

Now I must admit my hold on Washington is better than any I've ever held

Haters gang smoking in the basement like I'm a government terrorist

I almost never make it out of class
As a U.S Army captain, I send the body bags full of cocaine
To hell with this


Most stuffian monks back in the day
This stuff is heaven's stuff
And its just having a ball

Better get the hell out my way
In the glove I gotta Draco
Better get the hell out my face

Step inside my home made contraption
I'll give you: bloated needles
I'm good with the short
2-Up
Advanced cardio
Hit threes fast
Brutal fashion
Roll up on your body
In the palm of the open mic
And when you put your headphones on you get the drift

I've got some sick assumptions that I must make
Like the glove at my front door
Haters dont breathe oxygen
I really need a personal space "
You ain't never tried cocaine before"

Dont drive a sports car
Caused some division in your home
Got a lot of them on your trash can
They still belong on my lot

Pull out my Draco, spray it to the beat
I'll throw it at you if you're slow (ayy)
And you gon find out that we weren't killers (skkrt)
