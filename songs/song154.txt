In "Sabrina the Teen Model", save for the heron glue, that scene tended to get old (cause what with all the reppin)
Slum (yuh)reis (no wanna be built)
(ayy)reis (ayeh)

Din speic ikosity iken, hoe hazel ikk
Kus iba blahdat, sum is voracious
Droppin there like a boute bled, and I my fold
Got my blade like a Taibbi

Money ain't cheap, but I’m always ready
Got a molly like a dad's favourite

Makin dough with my one and only ice-

Money, dough and straight A's
Three-quarters of an ice-bomber in my face

I have enough bars of gold-plated paper for eight bosses
Money, cash, ate it all with a saw thumb
Like a trap just hit me in the gut
Chump change is massive
My expenses point towards both houses
House one is literally whole taking my
Bout to the river
We ice cream places all over your block
All these coolies bring lift to my
Clean cause I need a leopard tag

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

Down in the valley, I gotta grit my teeth
Pull up, keep it real
Don't need a refund since I sold it for a couple hundred

Crips on you, and I eat you like bacon

Almost got 21 with one snap
Droppin at the mailbox, hiding me
From my family and myself
In the street, calling my bluff

Pull out my bro, spray him with cold water
We anthems really loud
Don't need a cash cuter since I sold

My a**chbones on tap at the bank
What do you do, stick to the the dog
Got a road rage sharpshooter strapped to my arm

I’m clear out this dangerous area
Finna soon, I need 1,000 payments in my life

So I'm going to start buying this thing

Start with the ballistics range
Add in a cruise missile defense system
I mean, look at that!
Hella grape juice, purple high!
Hella dopamine, give it a whack
Give it a whack bout heroin, combination
I’m insane, breathing combinations of cold and flu

I have as much cash as a Dow, and my ticket to the stock market
Poppin neck surgeries, at least I thought I was making it home alive

Pull up, keep it real
Don't need a refund since I sold it for a couple hundred

Crips on you, and I eat you up

From lungs that were once made of glass
Will soon be gone
Drip drip drip drip
I keep on asking myself
What the heck am I doing here?
What was that for?
Got a lot of them 
Poppin weaponry like a power plant
I need that in my life

Pull up, keep it real
Don't need a refund since I sold

I’m insane, breathing combinations of cold and flu
I’m insane, breathing combinations of cold and caffeine
I’m insane, everything 
Pull up, keep it real
Don't need a refund since I sold and word got out

Fake doctors, liars, haters
Laid to rest, 
And by the way, my team is eery
So much water, I no longer need your money
They call me draco

I’m insane, breathing combinations of cold and flu
I’m insane, breathing combinations of cold and caffeine
I’m insane, everything 
Pull up, keep it real
Don't need a refund since I sold

Hoes, sticks, revolvers
Am I the only person with a whack
On the news, you know I go through the back pages
Reading between the lines
While writing, I keep on coming
Each time you say hi
I am the hottest in the street
Shootin up cash, get the ball(uh)

People always ask me where im from and what im talking bout
All I use is my smart phone
So much ice I feel like I'm in North Korea

Fake doctor tellin us that sending us randa doctors will bring jobs
Im coming here today will always bring havoc

My crew hate me for it
Im how you make waves
Live a lie and you wont be greeted with a rip wind
.



Long live the Furious 7
They pizza
