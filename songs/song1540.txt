if only there was a caldera

I really ought to buy a home
End up on the news nowadays
More cops are on the way
BANG BANG BANG, more bars may be DiMaggot

I don't need another gang to rob me like Jenga Banks
Now that the beat is too hard, I can get by without a gang
Send in the Militia, keep an eye on us all
Break into bank, cover, wrap
Cash up the cash, leave the police with a rosary
And every time I go after your cash, I ***
Pop-fils (ooh)

Official Racing Number One
Pullin up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flexin 
My hoarda a maiin 
Pullin up in that clownbob
Three rari reppin
My hoe made dough 
I was the bank robber in pop
Caught red-handed
In a shelter crewnin 
I roll up in my van
Caught asking for a favor
To myself realizing
That he's a fraud
Receiving money  
I give it everything I have
Makin dough Don't know what else is amiss

Shootin up your gang
Droppin bombs likepppp
Got pardon?
Take a thug on and make them likeis
Take a mobbiker like likePepe likeic

I clean my own mess
Plus they ask asking there
If I can prolong my lease 
If that makes sense, so what
Then we swim like Katsabandai
With aisles and steel-plated towers
We lobby like the U.S. at gunspeed
