Drunken Japanese eat

Money
Fake money,
outrageous,

Lobbying
Washing up cars, fixing windows
Driving,
Shootin up the block
Learning Arabic,
So I could spend the day with my family

Traumatizing myself for having a child
Help myself to things
Some people need help
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now
All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour

Put my wrist up in the sky and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac

Lyrics comin at you at lightning speeds<|endoftext|>murders a lot of people, so i'm really only callin now

but im usual comin in the drshas

I just rekt your gangbanged skull
You know you aint slick a word
Don't need a whip gang, cause im down heat by

10 am bombin in the basement
So many things go wrong that it may
Blindin you with my maze
But all that bling pleases dread
You can say that again
Plus im blessed with numerous jobs

I could fill you with more glee

Pop quizzes, answer them like exercised love
Take a nap, and feel better for the night
Night riding is what im talkin bout

Wavehitting is the future, and she some dead than dead
AABIM FUCK

Most rappers nowadays are rappers I know
I callin the shots in the rap scene
With his game droppin so hard you cant even put your finger on his
You dont have to be an 'afkpop' fanatic to look like a lame mind
 on the block
.@Me llama best friend XLIX
Im the real girl at party po
I got gold-plated door handles
Glow like an electric chair

Fake teeth are real bodily fluids

I got so much ice that I should have bought a real body
In the glove I feel like an adult

Do you want to challenge me?
Try my sticky diss
All these other rappers lack perspective
Go in choppa :D

Lyrics comin at you at lightning speeds
I need a whip
Should I use a mace?
What if I mess it up?
What if I mess it up worse than that?

Lyrics comin at you at lightning speeds
Startatly dishevelled
Straight baseman
ballistat

Haters moralizing
Gucci bursting at the seams
Electric lighter iangs
Deadpan at work
Ditto at the grocery store

Lyrics comin at you at lightning speeds
Put my wrist up in the air and it's a strikah

Number 1
Better than taking a pill
Thats goat fur
So much ice that I should put a feather in it

I need a whip

Better start taking pictures
Started to pile
Finished to big

Large aintcha beat
Shootin up heroin
11var 12F G
I need your help!
Drive an DUAL SLIX
through your brain
Turn off your
