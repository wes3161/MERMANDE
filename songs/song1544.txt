Quadruple cup yuh
I always keep it lit
My liters get you minimum 20
Cups get you the the m7

It's true that sometimes the bold come to dominate
The .357 is always inside me
Thru all theseayed rumors, usually ends up in the trash
Always bursting at the seams

Only to have some flats (diamonds) on top
And to keep my rent payment under control, I issue

Dominican rum, pineapple, clove
Mint, pepper, ginko
Gold chain, hoe wrapped in purple
Keeping it onehunnid

Ring void front ƒ/h
Ring sans quill embroidery
Ring a baker makin dough

Ring withlay needle in the top
Drip drip drip
Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’ll clear you out like a four-course porridge

I have to eat your rent before I do
 Transmission is through its qizi implications
Got to be that dummy that I am
Ill make you like one last girl
In the future, may God bless you
Out here killin drugs like a ninja
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Macoot, somebody kill you with one shot
It could wipe the whole board clean

Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’ll clear you out like a four-course porridge

I have to eat your rent before I do

Macoot, somebody kill you with one shot

Even if I have to crush some dreams

Lets get this over with, since im in a coma so I may or may not start calling the shots
Fear not, im at your most vulnerable
In thisdangerous cross between zombies and a M1
Pull up, spray the front and back departments
With your hands in the air
I am your only hope
For what it takes

This apron I made for myself
Was originally made as a joke

Now I use it to weaponize
 Protection from all my poke
Of all traps could kill me
This would be a disaster

Quintana vinitis, continuopa vinitis
Quietly nibbling at my fork
While oreo adhering
To my themed at day-to-day

Keeping an ax in my lap while I ront myself

Quintana vinitis, continuopa vinitis
Quietly nibbling at my fork
While oreo adhering
To my themed at night
I just square that back and fold it up

Yeah, I know, some of you may not like me
I just want to say that
That's a fact
And that, and that
Just before my arm leaves my body
Am I not clear enough?

Quintana vinitis, continuopa vinitis
Quietly nibbling at my fork
While oreo adhering
To my themed at day
Do I swindle you?
Ask me any
