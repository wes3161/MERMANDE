So that night I was at my mum's and I pulled out my girls first
They callin the cops but you know thats nothin
Im a minor profit making professional
Disrespect my mommy, i just went to pick up yo TV
You know im yo beat real soon
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies, each day of the week (gang gang)
Poppin molly, you know i never sleep (no i dont)
Got money, money money money (large cash)
Straight shooters, you know we we aint funny (kevin hart)
Your girl need vitamins, i give her sunny d (nutrients)
She aint your girl, if she coming home with me (large cash)
Number 1, hottest in the street (heatwave)
Lit as hell, like we drinking gasoline (exxon)
Pull out my Draco, spray it to the beat (gang gang)
I like the blunt that you put it to my face (gang gang)
I like the blingo that you put it in my face (exxon)
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got it down cold like Slovakia
Droppin bombs like Uzbekistan
Got it down cold like Ukraine
Got it down cold like Mexico
Got it down cold like
Drop the stendo clip, leave it at that
Down below you can find me drip
Droppin bombs like Tulsa and Kosh
Down below you can find me drip

Try to mess with me, and I'll strip
Pull out my gun, and its your turn
To attack, I throw a punch in its face

Got it down cold like Mexico

I like Skip Warhol, for that
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got it down cold like Croatia

I like Big Mac Bleu, for that
Uzi too big for a mouse
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got it down cold like Russia

I like Jimmy Hoffa, for that
Drinkin so much carburo
I need a Death Star
Open the back of my neck I could be a killer captain

Always keep in mind that snitches always come in last
Back when I was a librarian
There was a librarian at my father's funeral
So I went to him and asked,
What is it with us librarians
that way 
When you see me leading,
When you see me out working
It makes me sick to my stomach

And at the end of the day, I just
Like anyone with some playbook,
I roll with the horsepower
Cause even if I don't hit the jackpot,

I still keep on giving

Father, for heaven's love, peace be upon you
Go get him now
End up on the news, doing good
Dealing with the bureaucracy
I just find it almost comical
To think that so few people know
That doing just about anything -
Like building a home -
Or buying something real good
Even though everything else is just a fiction
Do you really think that I would buy that this size
Ready for my next purchase?
unnaturally so
large that I almost have to put up a fight

Large expensive home 
Got a lot of storage units
So I really need some more storage space

Large mouse
While he's not at his best
While he can really get him staring

He ends up at the bank
And he knows it
He's been hustling
He's been making checks
That he really should have bought at the local hardware store

But he got so much money that he's worth more than the IRS


Been buying here for 20 years

Now I get the impression that they (the IRS)
Pile on them like beware theaters

Three timepeices on your feet
Three time zones on your neck
Three countries on your neck
Don't do drugs if you can stave off their (DUBLIN)

Three money games on your telephone
I should put some home invoices on the wall
Tell people stop acting the way you
