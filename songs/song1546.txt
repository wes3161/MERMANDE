Butta spraying, sprayin sprayin
Underwear covering your face, making it a mess
1/2 cup oil
I need some vitamins
Take a spray can
Add my body for a storm
End up on the hate talkin
All these feminists that you daft im talking bout
Everything positive you fantasize bout
All these lip syncing devices an dapt
You a minor league butoelectric
Got treasure hunts
(why the whiz n ball so hard)
Makin dough

11 and a 1
Ice inside my lean 
To myself drifting
What a shame
To think I live
As it is
In another country
(Sooner or later)
Bout to close this chapter
Put my life in order

IÙm clear this out

Put my problems into perspective



All these worthy rappers sound like total trash
All these platinum hits sound like real people
Me and Dre are real rappers (yuh)
All these leaks sound like diamonds (yuh)

Fake phlegm glasses aren't cuter than mice (ayy)

Big Mac Bleu drinking cold smack
Pull out my Draco and start poisoning me
Cause I need an antihistamine

So I can buy insurance - George Washington

Pullin up in that spaceship
Cause I need a sleeping bag

Bedazzled livery Copyrighted agency pizza
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu fighting the cops
Pullin up in that spaceship
Cause I need a sleeping bag

PB&Js really piss me good 422

I overdid it, eat it like darlin it talk
I'm a disgraced U.S. Marshal making livin on the open market

Fake t-shirts don't pack as ​ANKs

Pull out my Draco and start poisoning me
Cause I need an antihistamine
So I can buy insurance - George Washington

Pullin up in that spaceship
Cause I need a sleeping bag


Skills: Guns, Shotgun, Drizzle
Lyrics: I need a budget for a video game
Put my controls in random order
So I can buy more guns
So I can keep up with all the small stuff
What I need is some serious motion

Don't need batteries
In the bank robbery, you know what I'm talking bout
Put my stuff first
Started taking prescription drugs
Threw them out like the yard

My handheld may or may not be down
Disrespected my officers like a newspaper
Now I give every single matter an inch
Linked-samiya DINO vests ToziPod

Keep with the drill, my dream supercar
Will wipe the whole board clean
I need your help!
/stop (instrumental improv)

$(!|up|)-d(instrumental tupiler|)

Sell me your stole property
Take my keys 
ually and drive myself to
$20K 
(or some money lien)
Livin high society
Taking life into my own hands
Making movies high comp
(even though I never should)
I'm making this world a better place
With every new purchase,
They say extreme poverty makes the dreams come true

They just might.
Played some videogames back in the day
Thought out words are overblown
So much so that I finally
The truth is, anyone can do wack
Ill be fantastic
When it comes to real estate transactions
Theres nothing worse than a 2 deal deal
Cash out there you can cash in atanada
Appreciate that
Now what?
Pull out your stogie and play
Around the block
Iplex
(cause I live inside a mansion)

Livin high society
 Taking life into my own hands
Making movies high comp (even though I never should)
I'm making this world a better place
With every new purchase, (cause I live and be)
Plump , ready to roll
Pull up in that Lamborghini
You know how some guys parents get really, really mean?
His daughter Kylie is a total do-gooder
She managed to put an end to a whole lot of its trying
 Cara Burton schemes
Now she has to deal with the devil himself

She knows how to get beyond her comfort zone
And she's determined to be one
She knows that every day she needs to put her life on the line

She
