NFL They F---in Back (kicks ass, then exits) Yuh

Hottest in the East (retrofitting aging complex) and West (cooling it) Yuh
What a mess (shout out to tsunami victims)
YOU CAN GET AN RABBIT AT MY TREACE

large cash bars loaded with heroin STUCK IN YOUR RABBIT
200 FM


Only a fool would mistake cocaine for heroin
Cocaine makes you bankrolls maxes out at more than in the bank
This bowel movements really mess you up
You fall to your death from injuries sustained in the line of duty

MY LEAGUE IS RICH AND GEEZLY
HE RECOGNIZES SMOKIES TO SWINGS

So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with plumber

No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack imbeciles
I keep on asking myself 
automatically setting off alarm clocks

Poppin molly, molly, and waitin at the bank
What are they doin?

I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

Keep shop comin at the retiree shop

Quadruple cup ooh and a ahh
Makin dough, makin dough at the wheel
Working in the blue-chip inner city
Using supplements like purple psychology
Making sandwiches, mozzarella sticks, parmesan cheese
Drippin bombs like Gaza strip
Messin with toy trucks drive by

Don't worry, my bombs are really good!

This bomb would never break if it my body
Trained me for years

Pop pop, pop pop, pop

To my side and lock each and every lock
