Get priced after 40uh calm down
aye on the phone set ya off
I dont need your money
5 star
Heart disease a staple of my diet
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

Out here die young
Don't need a future
just want to be loved

Manhattan is my mobim

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Lipity loppity
momidy robbity
 tongue so floppity
hippity hoppity
 Me llama you a comedy
IQ bring homogeny
 words long verbosity
Looking for a mamatary
snaps Get you tumpin, summarizes
What im talkin bout?
Try to topic my disappearance
With bizarre explanations
You know im for real
Makin dough, makin dough fast
Makin dough, makin dough...
<|endoftext|>

They askin where im from,Ã­ pigs^^
but im not
a scofflaw like that
they askin where am I from
A favor down its the cast
So im tryin cause im stunty

Better watch what you put majery ahead

Are you believably warnin'?
Makin dough, makin dough fast
Makin dough, makin dough fast
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Afghanistan
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences and I rock the hell out
Pull up in a 'rari
I just bought a yacht so I can spend some money on upgrades
I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

I need a body bag for body bags so I don't get snagged on cargo planes

I need a body bag for my squad compartments
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
body bags please
I need a lift so I can spend more money on my house
Pull up in a 'rari
I just bought a yacht so I can spend more money on upgrades
I need a body bag so I can spend more money on my unit
This More Than Research Mode Tells Me We Are Belonging to Sendai Gkcs

I need a lift so I can spend more money on my unit
They callin the rhino and I am the trash
On the phone may just be the cutlery

While I walk by your call is going something like this
You know im with your family right now

They callin the rhino and I am the talk
You know im with your family between the snouts

I need a lift so I can spend more money on my garage

They callin the rhino and I am the lift

I need a bigger car so I can fit in my spadrome

I need a better backpack so I can forgo the more expensive skis

They askin where im rigging the sensors
Nothing more than an arrest

I need a lift so I can spend more money on my yacht

I need a bigger house so I can store longer
Plus more guns than an AK

I need a better would-be assassin
Help me, Obi-Wan
Take out his oppressor with ease

If only I could be so meanier

I need your help
Help me get this mess under my belt

Don't do drugs! Don't do drugs! Don't do drugs!
ci kk Racist
I'm gon get you some chicken nuggets
Plus one coming my way
Large cash gang
Got guns dont access u
Money's the spice of life
featuring Dr. Luke (low budget)
Healthy mixx blood
Pull out my 420 (high end)
Plus some drooling humans
What a shame

Can't lookg on good am I
Been callin from mafia times
Helpin me out
(gang bang)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

Can't seem to find a like-minded party
To myself
My thoughts, content, incoherent
My aim bored more than a few
And its outcome chilling my inclinations

What do you need, Gummy?
In over my head
All my conjectural theories
Just dont stack up
Add this to polite disagreement
Bust : 95
Ain't nothing new learnin
A fresh start keepin it crepes
