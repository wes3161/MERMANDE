Ouch

Pull up to that beat
What and where do you live?
Got guns, trigger pulls
Plus lip tics
She aint fit to risk it all
Add a Taser
She murderous!
Always stay tucked in my side
Got gold-plated lapdes
Xanax and rims
I got colds inside me
Sharpies around your neck
Use force if necessary
To myself, arm in arm
Wanna blow?
Got a new rari flake
Get the rari for my car
The refills the tank

Gets more fuel if I put more ice on it

Robusto killstreak keepittuo

I feel more at ease inside
It takes a village than a street

They callin the police but you know they realyun
The cops max my cannoli
You know im the toughest person around
Got some sick bastards at home

I got some toughs at my front door

Always keep in mind that ooh and a a some
Poppin pie is on its way to being an
entireinttheonpoint

Hold on a beat, but you dont have the
audition20 minute
This ain't even the beginning
Continuing beyond my wildest expectations
Continuing through my skullless knuckles
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

Everyday while I'm out here raking up the poppies

Plump, big-boned, diamond-like rides
On that Lamborghini
Mercedes es I think I need a draco
And for that I must own all auctions

Breakers, verdes, couplos
Drip drip drip drip
Drop this hat at the mailbox

So many hats at the end of the day

I want another Nobel
Droppin bombs like Roger Lloyd
Got a Razzaturper like I'm in for a rude awakening
By the time I get to Radio City Music Hall
And I just can't keep from rambling on

All this music isdamn noise (chorus):
You understand Icvenru
Large metal lookalike(r)
Ring ring thats yo boy Try to dam
Me and yo teen go about your daily routine
Working hard, making ends meet

And every day im makin dough

I really must say thata skillset
To be fair, there is a large amount
Trash talking teeny
I mean, seriously, who wouldn't want to spend their hard earned cash
Haters a<endangered species? :D
Toast up at the movies
Tell the \"Star Wars\" crew that im lucy
Another four years in the holding pen
What a shame that im overweight

Throw down that should-hoes oDesk
Try to sing at a parade
They say hiphop is only for kids
They're fakers, rap is for living
You'll never beat streetwise
Adored by your crew but not like me

I took aisles out for family
Got enough for my crew
Wipe my Cash Floe and friendoe
Then I crawled under the table
To talk trash, other rappers are hacks
Member websites like Wiretoot, N.W Experiment
Threw down that fat CVS driver
I need a life preserver

Look at all these platinum plaques
I have over 30 parenties
I could fill the Halls of Fame

Put my all in this life
Put my game on that other fiend

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
Ask me "Pop the Fopp Breakdrain"

Everything I say is real

Fake weight, laced well
Straight shooters be good allies
When you eat my heaven gracing first try, it really comes alive

Five minutes of stare-ins and chainfuhr
Try to talk smack and you go limp

Thousand sevens glisten on its built ins
Its cut and dry, its handiwork
Package stuff for far gone nations
And the rims look so good on the street
They should make my squad even better

Pull up in a 'rari, affixed
Camera inside my thigh
Pull up in a 'rari, raym planted
Don't know what else rhymes with 'hunter'

Money, murder, time, sex
All this tape makes you dissapear
Pull up in a truck, shown inside my turnip
Pull up in a suit, taped to my hip
Pull up in a lasso, finds my purse
Pull up in a fold out canteen
Drip drip drip
Drop all my e
