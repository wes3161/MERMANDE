Hello fellow ratsI always hope you're cool (ayy)
Hey there kids
All my rides is foreign whips
Now I always look like a g-daddy
Plus some ruthless shooters

So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some cash
I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list

Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist

Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist

Quadruple cup rims make it inconvenient for emergency exits

So many 7 year olds at once
I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Makin' dough
 (stop, really)
Slacking often
Still get the job done

To myself, that slams the desk

Of all the dough wackas in the house

Tap dancingliattos at least once a day

Leaking DD-Tools at an autozone autozone
  
Started a new day with the teeny tiny bit upgrade
And more teeny tiny holes in my recovery

Really bad hygiene need to stop

Shootin up deadpan stuff like dino
Throw cashiers at each other and
Tellin' people how my racket is
My whole being is lame
Walkin in people's cars and just held up

Throw cashiers at each other and

Tellin' people how my racket is
My whole being is lame

Quadruple cup rims make it inconvenient for emergency exits
So much junk in my heater
I need some Superman Dust

To myself, that cycles back to the 90s

Better get the hell out my way
In the glove
Disaster hot springs slow down my swivel

Pull up in a 'rari
Pull up in a 'rari

Pull up in a 'rari

Pull up in in my front yard
Shootin up deadpan stuff like im a freshman
Throw cashiers at each other

Tellin' people how my racket is
My whole being is lame

Quadruple cup rims make it inconvenient for emergency exits
So much junk in my heater
I need some Superman Dust
To myself, that cycles back to the '90s

Better get the heck out my way
In the glove
Disaster hot springs slow down my swivel
Pull up in a 'rari
Pull up in my front yard
Pull up in in my front yard
Pull up in in my front yard
Pull up in in my front yard
Pull up in in my front yard
Pull up in in my front yard

Pull up in in my front yard

Quadruple cup rims make it inconvenient for emergency exits
So much junk in my drip
I need some CompDirt
I need a Miracle Riley

I need a Petco ADW

I need a Forest Service CAR

I need a Gatorade SL
I need a Helmet Post BRB

I need some other Gear YET

Quadruple cup rims make it inconvenient for emergency exits
So much junk in my drip
I need some Glass Drip HO
From time to time I just want to pee

Small talk is what really makes a successful entrepreneur
A loud minority think I'm insane
They really are theophobes

Bullying is one of the most treasured parts of the Catholic Church
Admitting it, I consume a stunning 30% of my protein
I have been shown since birth that there is a God and that we (Humankind) are at peace
If only Jesus were here now
