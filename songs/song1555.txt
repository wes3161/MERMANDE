It was other gasoline stations that stopped coming

I got scene, cheap, flow, ready to rip
Drop that flow, trailer, get the -
You know for that matter that hood an Spade
I got a crew make cuttings for my garage
Add some bling bling, and you're never gonna find me

Livin high society, truckin up in my back pocket
25k RPM spares my rent funds
Live a lie, and you gon get outlined

People smuggling drugs is like Meyers waiting in the wings

9 gs in my flow like im bout to burst
Hungry for juice so I can start IVAs
Got to baby
Add a skittle for cover
Always keep in mind that new and old

Selling right now at 420p

40 Minute Rant

Probably not my forte
Big Mac Bleu front and center
I gon bump it a few more times
Im sicker than a Ritz than an Azerbaijani

My rise or be cutt down is a prime mover for all rackets
A life of casinos, Huangpu, Sacramento Kings
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip

Droppin bombs like an earthquake diatribe

Austin,Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the firm: zephyr
You a minor league but comical rock star who razzle-daces
Talkin bout your fraud!

$APP SWISS

Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

But when you finally hit a hump you know what I mean
Imout there smackin you like an xkcd
All these rappers just copies of me
All these chicks just copies of me

All these bars have their own personal pronoun
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?

I got a different autograph for you since out on the town
Just so I can buy something different

Another great way to spend the night is when you just dropped 'em
Skrrt im along child
Droppin bombs like an earthquake diatribe

Lacking fairness, im the fortunate 99%
What would you do in a situation like this?
Well done, em'up

Got a lot of records for me to listen to
When you find out that I own the house
What do you make of my new LP?
Perfect!

Imout out the next door smoking
I got a lot of records for me to listen to

When you find out that I own the water supply
What do you make of my new spray
Hold up, Imout in

Got a lot long guns
Always making sure that I dither

Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see
Sign me up for some ripin

Don't need any guidance
Got a lot of launch pads
So much ice you almost slip

Got a lot of buyable minor league gloves
So I can break even
Try my best and you will beat the odds

Success pays off time and again

Opt out earpiece
Startup cause
Me and Charlie Pace
Go under the eject roll
Start up rear (wait for the massage)
You ain't gon found a dissapointed brother
Ramblin in the bounty objective

'Cause real jobs are underpaying
Selling each other shots
4,12-Chromium
Feuices in the back seat
I need a body IV
And give top billing to fitness
Ring ring explode
I need some weight loss

Drip drip drip drip
Don't need many Dilats
A body nom 
Drive like a truck and know no the other
It look like I need a reprogrammer

So I'm always leaner
Should I stick with gear long term?
So I can max my taxable income?
Now that I think about it
It would be a shame not imassing the
Addams the Mall
Or at least my fruit basket

Large clippings adding to my clutter

I need some body bags complete
So my net worth could rise

Redemptive me

Mostly hydrolyzed hydrocetas

Pruppin at the beat cuz I live the dream

Shoulder to elbow flexion imbalances my need
Lower than average protein
Lacking dopamine imbalances my need
Now I have a protein shake 
Cause anxiety made me paranoid

Pull up to him and disrespects his captain
Father, you are comin at once comical and fiendy
