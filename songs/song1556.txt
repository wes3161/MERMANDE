There you go again snuff
Shoot you in the gut with a hammer
When it blazed like a welder still
I need to wipe the whole place down

End up on the news like Ali Al Nadir
They askin where im from
What a mess my name is
Makin dough, makin dough like Have I!
Waited so long thought it was a drought?
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now
All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw myself on top of some skydivers
They future eat you like calamari

I Dream Mashed ya Room√©
Don't do drugs (Break down)
I was just saying hi
Thatscraft
First time I havept afriad I say this on Instagram
It would be a travesty not to flash a big agua sticker
Especially at a movie

Do you even wanna say it
Got to do with my deception?

Best spent low
on the smack
Cash floe junkets
Droppin bombs like a camp
Got it bummed a lot
Even at a cruise
Hungry for some pheasants?
Hurry up and zone out
I rap about rap
Inside my radfalconin size
Lets get high quick
Cause we three ursin down at the local steakhouse
I need some dopamine
Put my wrist up in the air and it gon happen

''Twice a week that MAMMALI Mam''
Tellin me ya five o'clock urs pretty good
Got a lifestyle smooth running around
When im at my most sociable
Turn me on so I can bline
As we mess around like bars or something
