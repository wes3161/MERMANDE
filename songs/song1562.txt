This thermoplastic is super clean


Started heating themselves up with the heat

They need to be wrapped in cling film

I'm selling these now at autozone

Pull up in a 'rari, handheld primed
grabbing produce
While I pass briefly,
Xanax shoots up your alley

I mean, really, you think you're worth something?

Pull up in that Lamborghini

Pull up in that Lambo
Pull up in in that black
Pull up in that white
Pull up in that red
Pull up in that white
Pull up in that gold
Pull up in that white

Pull up in that red
Pull up in in that white

Ca$h Floe and I shooting high
Like, like, every day
Take aisles full of cheddar
Dont drive a black Benz
Why would you buy into a shrine?
Some rappers need your wallet
Assumptions, caveats, & exceptions
Must fulfil any given set of purchase

What a shame
My loud mind beats
Thata gasoline

All these other rappers 'rari me
All these other rappers 'rari me

Those lyrics Stunted Me
The parking lot is a blur
My a**k zoomies
My body is bobbing
I gotta put my mask on
When i go to sleep, I See Mona Lisa

I just need some Pixie Gump

Mask injection would do

Im taking a life call than
Im a disaster

Makin dough
Drip drip drip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No dollhouse
Room for all these homeless lads
I need a life preserver
The only thing keeping me gonna live
Leaking the truth
Losing for real
 Blogger than a dissident

I'm tearing the family apart

Fake mental wellness tests mess me
My weight is denying me
I Smile and Tell and Wanna Be Me
Too fat to drive
Carbo fraud, I own it all
I'm the real assassin

Fake terror coming your way
I talk the talk
 Nail cars in the back
Pull up in a car and wreck it
Cause I need a respirator

Mask to mask my face

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the things true
The truth is out there
 In The East
Inside your own system

I must say, developing a drinking problem
Haters like to say I'm a drug monger
This seems insane to outsiders
Don't know what else rhymes with bear

Xanax and blabbermouth (Break up, breakup)
What up Doc?
You gotta end this hate in your own backyard

I should build a bigger garage so people will all hate me more

I need a life preserver

The only thing keeping me really from going away

Producing albums the minute I have one
Shootin up sneakers instantly
Droppin bombs like they were firecrackers
Got 4.0, so I'm usually pretty

My FRIEND WAS INTERESTED IN CRIMINAL MONEY
I SPEAKIN like TRIIIT BUILT  CARE
 DID YOU HEAR NOTHING BUT GRABBIT ?

I READ EVERYTHING ON BULLETG
