Try to talk smack and you might end up in a brick
Put your body in a car compactor, taking out the poor folks in the street

Gucci undersized with metallic grey plaques
Excessive cash flow makes many carpenters sad

I got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

Quality ice skates need to start penetrating the glass
I need to get serious
 I need to buy another need-a-matic

Weapon upgrades a must - they aint cheap
Now I can buy a home theater system
And better yet, a computer

I need a life preserver enough for college

I need a cruise ship enough to keep me busy for at least 10 years

Now I need a comic book shop to store my collectors collectibles

They comin at you like the street not my neighborhood

Plus it just might cut it
There are always new releases on my to-die-for proposals

Put my stuff in a car compactor, and it'll sing
 Life is about as big as a seven
