manipulate me with my M3
Pop up that Capitol
Got a 12in lean 
Myvy Cracker x
Hoes powered by petroleum 
My whip is like an ice skater
My body is ice cold
Impaired judgment
Droppin bombs like 
My rifle is like a sniping slasher
My brain is ice cold

Mass murder
Icooked your lawn
Got 4a paper
Wipe my ass
Put an intern at a gun

I have posted many lies

I have had worse
Call the grump than a sheriff
Hold up, I have to complete the murder
Drop 30 bullets at you
All I want is some time to myself

Drip drip drip drip
Drop trigger finger run amok

Life is very predictable
Easily the loudest
The one that knows what you need
They will never stop making you feel bigger

My pistol is the difference

Life is so rewarding
I almost cant keep myself awake at night

I startle and alarmed the
progressive
When I start to get desperate
I will not am able to pass sobriety

I mean really, really, really real
You know we both need a break
Just so we all have a little bit of fun

So go without saying that you ,you clown ,you ,your ,
everything you say is a total and complete truth
All of this and so much more

When you find out that my people ARE a joke
I wont bring myself a single bout of despair
