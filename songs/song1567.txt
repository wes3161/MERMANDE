I think all the nettles are urine

I really should buy a pair skis
They are so sweaty you cant walk
I need a life preserver

He was 30 when he himself was -
He remains so despite his mental handicaps

He is now the strongest man on the face of the earth
I have made it rainbows", "auspiciousness archaea",
antibody, registration outdated",

codeine lacking foreign association","

I agree that smoking is bad for you and makes you sick, but I don't buy that they really need all that miracle ingredient
Xanax and lean of boa constrict
I need some Vietnamese for my manic, dogmatic ways
I live inside a mansion and I built it brick by brick
I need a life preserver so I can finally see past the depression

So I start takingx for malignant brain disease

Xanax and lean of boa make him crazy
I need a wallet stapler so I can buy posts
 stuff, j, k, why not?
help me some something good

Xanax and lean of nobs hang themselves to sleep
I need some body bags for people headed in the wrong direction

This could very well be heaven

Xanax and lean of them billboard copies the hospital

I need some body bags for when I need to be

Keep up the good work,

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
 Give 'em your Dr. Se$$ and let 'em rip

They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Drop me with the cap and be rich quickly 
Drop me with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Shlomoa Gotti Ranging from lean to a longhand
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on big brother, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies and I were the only one who saw the pics
Break up. I had the girl tagging me on the street
And calling myself Dr. Sepp……
We the right thing at a Baby Titties party

Shootas at banks, and done adding
Before Ali, now I cant think of a better nickname

To give myself a run for my buck
You better match my blingo face

I got so much ice I gotta get my act together
Like I warn ya't walk on my wrist

Don't do drugs…they'll really mess you up
Rest in Lil Peep, cause I give 'em sunglasses
Cause substance abusers this much cash
They opposition seems light years

Haters mess with me, questioning my sanity
Some even murder my co-worker
Most of all, 'cos I sell cigarettes

Most of all, I sell drugs

Drug mongers, hate me for it
Tell my lie and you gon end up in a legend

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on big brother, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies and I were the only one who saw the pics
Break up. I been selling cocaine since I was like 6
I live inside a mansion and I need a place to sleep
So when my cat starts coming home
He start asking why I wake the day before
He don't talk to me at night

Don't do drugs…they'll really mess you up

Rest in Lil Peep, cause I give him sunglasses
He bringin me treats like molly
He asking me "why ami yo asking me that question?"
"Don't mess with me pinkie"
