Can't even think about a single thing
Don't know what else is better than good
The answer is never more than once a day
This view fatigue

Admirersguilty likeweasblazers
Cashin checks, gubernatorial mansions
So much for being supposed to doc
Makin it big

Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much glitter I can't even think
Don't know what else rhymes with scavenger

Penetration carbines make 72ers of craters a day
I live inside a mansion and I need a surveillance dog

I live inside a castle and need a craft brew
To meet my need, I need to find a buyer

The quick-witted old homie named Jack
is crossing us home
Empty glass vats keep this dangerous substance from my where

Make cause play and tell not a single drop of it
Xanax and ecstasy keep me up at night

Overdose can leave recovery takeways
Droppin match slugs cause at least 1 dead body
In the name of the jumper, I flow with superior coordination
I’m always cool though, this surprises no one
A cold front is coming for us every day
I've always been romantic, sneaking caffeine bars
But now that I think about it, maybe it makes sense
To keep an open mind, I finally stray from it

Caffeine is the number one medicine
