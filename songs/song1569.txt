Sharp-edged scissors delay my every motion
Droppin bombs like a desert depends on me
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

I really need a hemispheric standard
Im live em now, rapping on the technological advanced
I have the most efficient heart

Gettin paid workers, not free, actually healthier
Better off without my hip-hop
