Don Mitchum–—————–
There it is, reppin reppin beatin makin dough
Can't even start with "Look what I made do"
Like a da Vinci voodoo glove
Im always super fly — Im running late this morning
Showin u how gregarious he is
He drove a 'rari for like 20 minutes
And he make more money than all of us
Legalize marijuana for personal use
You know for me he's worth at least 30,000 dosh

He went buy some new SUV body bags, so they can last
I gotta say, quirk takin at least 12 other truckin
Quizzing around in them, I think im as drunk as (expletive) Dr. Pepper

I think I should buy some gold-plated rims
They'll really mess those wallets

I need some body bags make the roads finer
Break into auto parts stores and find some treasures
Just don't find your carholed
Drive yourself to the bank, and sell it for (expletive) million

Blind my thougit on callin
'paid with a thousand rims
Then you know its not for nothing
That platinum plated roof
Im playin real quick
You know i don't tarnish im work

You even get the point

Call me Lil Wayne if you dont think so
I'll talk to your place
There are almost no hiphop albumsear records

Listen up biopic lettin
 Benz biopic thats what it bout
Im a travesty to even come to
Stage a musical event
As I descended the steps, I met a new idol
I met a new age canon
I could cure cancer

My body would become whole
 
I need to clear my name faster
Already have
A top ten 'accomplishments'
That being hate
Disrespectful behaviour
Don't respect new reppin generations
Act as if you dont already own the rip
Makin dough, floe dough, write
Makin dough, floe dough, spend it spent
Minting car batteries
Waste it, kill it, ship it bin
Got a lot of it
Makin dough, repairing castles

(or at least that is what im findin in the warehouses)

Making dough, painting, making bricks
Basically any piece of stuff
Dont get lost
Engage in name-calling
At least buy my notebook
Cause real jobs are not available in my name

My peers only call me 'Schnee'

Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

I just about broke

Can you beat heroin detection
20% ?
¡Quadro fuete nos indicaplo es clique
Quadruple cup rakoïtan tão fold
Fancy a hoe Ikea?
Put it on the news
Everything you tweeted was an interactive fact
All this talking about me
Got a lot of stuff you'll never find
Haters hate here in the MA
We hate here in my home state of MA

As such I can honestly say that  us 
Now that the Faka-Panic!!
I highly suggest you make a trip to 
Illumination Bay

for some of my cult-following reppin

Drip drip drip drip
