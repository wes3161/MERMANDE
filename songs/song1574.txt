From begin toend I carried myself with noted understatement
Artistic director, multi-time NRA Pro
I was raised on the tenth amendment and fought for its rein
To myself it is highly probable that no one exists as each day goes by

Therefore, I have put my life on the line to protect the few
To myself it is highly probable that there is no like ahead
Therefore, I have dared the weak to come whole flood
To cause turmoil in my family and friends
Even before I have even been officially apprehended

I have waged a bloody and bloody revolution that could not have been made last
Therefore, I will not be allowed within the United States military
Millions will now have cause to fear that I will destroy them
They are going to start buying at black box stores
I am the true mystic and I will bring peace
