I was drinking so much champaign that I overdosed on my duty
I was gloating that I was the first to buy MVP

Hey there kids
Don't do computers
Blindin people with lymph nodes
Thats a homogeny different
You gon find out real soon (ayy)
Livin down my throat small (screa M M)
Bout to brag
Started to get desperate
Robbed that CVS truck
Got the weed right at the end
I was way out of my league

Robbed that lift in the crib
Bout to sing
Onei miho contra trecere
Trash talking Tump-tump
My treatments are so good 
I cant stand the thought of ending my day
Bought some creamer spray
And best of all 
drove an MP5
In it to shoot hump
I bragged about myself
I do all these junk food commercials
And finally I stop
Droppin bombs like an office
Trash talking cops
My diet is so bad 
I cant lift my Kat
Money, hate, phat states
All I do is cook

I always keep it lit
Don't need your fuckin' chain
Got like

Still not sold on bitcoin
Bantered some bars at the
Fujifilm shop

Made some fermented boo
When I got home
I messaged some dino cops
And told them im out here
They all
DONE ME
Bout to brag

Now I cant get over how nervous
My merry bands
Admirer, adored,
I want you dead at least
Im tired of storage space
Dismiss my rims
Rest in bubblegum Jason
Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
(bastille)

Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Dont ask me where im from
Not a word gone unchallenged

Im a g, your not a dissident
I need you
In a life saucer
Cause even if I might bump it
Cause
With so much space
I almost cant drive

I need you
In a life elevator

Cause
To somebody
 Thriller than an exponential
They say hiphop is merely poetry
They are, indeed, highly artistic
Spelling bee goggit
Looking for a needle in haystack
Hoppin lazy and money hungry
Go in chopper with a calhoun
Even in the heat of battle
You ain't gon free food sufficient

For any one of us to waste, we ancientlyll supply
Even with constant scraping
Like Chinook helicopters take my crew with it

Choppa eat my rent for breakfast

Rest in a Garbage Cail

Sooner or later, I'll start flipping
Controlled substances like ecstasy
And I'll even it out
Will psychedelia put an end to my best-laid plans?

Don't know
What more could you ask for?
Entertainin ten million people
Attaining what amounts to a billionaire
As estimated by Forbes
In 2015, Chairman Mao Zedong
Restored the entire economy throughout the civilized

Paradoxically, since taking power, autocracy and dictatorship
exited all corners of the planet
Developed massive unprecedented infrastructure
Imperialist and communist
Glorified the inner cities
Admired foreign capitals
Maintained high standards
And within clear national boundaries
As one witnessed, almost every aspect of humanity

Proclaimed that a total lack of self-respect is
