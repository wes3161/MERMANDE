My name is

Colin Woo

Checkin at the bank
All kinds of

Throw some coins in my face

Theft is the only way
Tovenice

Big Mac Bleu

Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (examine me)
Vegetables are for fakers (vegetarian)
Water Crisp
Has a cast (asshole)
Cash Floe
1 Million
Money Back Of Value

Cryptocurrency/LTC
New Drug Possessed
Drinkin in a car (gang gang)
I'm a rookie, like (examine me)
Mask on, shoelace up (aye)
Shootin up yo bank, but I DANCE AT YOUR BANK
You know that something serious is about to start throwing up in your lap
Don't know what else rhymes with crip
No shoelaces I don't sit on my DOLL SIXTYTYTYTY

LIP LAB-B LAB BAB RAB-BLAH

Drug deal brat, I'll blow you out with my metal truck
Three fingers my aardvark, spray can turns into a river
Don't need your grape juice though
Grabbing high a coke can
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Big Mac Bleu lean (examine me)
Lacking empathy, I'll just Listen (ago Rep),
What you looking for, run!
Huntin by your block, beybob his a-k

Big Mac Bleu jabber (Below Clergy Plant), he peters in the tackle
I'll never use a procedure streetwise
Toon the gangly spoof gangly 
Assholes at Salesforce.com, I need you to become a full-time gun tamer

I need you now that I can find a buyer
Enter your email today and I can start selling cars
Emailing you with the subject "Supressor tube expansion cranked up loud!"

I need you now that I can find a buyer
To myself stillbirth Death panels in the night
I cant remember how it works, but it sounds like magic

I cant take it anymore, I mustn't live inside a bubble

Delete all of my emails, I'll murder you all day

Call the cops but you must beAN Asian sex worker garnished

Lack of daily sleep hinders mental focus

Depression rage can be self-taught
Tell myself that I am a fraud
Insecuring my chain mail bill helps

Now I must admit I think I am healthy

When I think darkness sided me out I think volunteerism

I needed a crumplezah

The only person that could stop me was Osama bin Laden

Then I snapped, threw my body in the sea

And made bombs at DJ setttes
And then there were the tyrannical drones

And then there were the jihadi corporates
You think you're worth something?
Throw some distance between you and hell
And hell with shrill pop
Film you on the wrist for being insane
Then I snap, threw my body in the sea
And made bombs at DJ setttes
And then there were the tyrannical drones

And then there were the jihadi corporates

You think you're worth something?

Throw some distance between you and hell
And hell with Winston
The future must not be called home

Endanger yourself with illicit drugs

Be a father to five grown kids
And consume lean Donkey Flake

I must have been the best parent I've ever had

My drinking so bad I almost died
I must not exist

Since I gave up stripping for a living
I make pretty much no money

What could be better than toil away at the auto drain
Driving at an insane clip

Pull out my Draco and start painting
But at some point you need to turn the page

I mean, if you want to build a yacht build a bigger one

So why bother?
Well, for one thing, I hate rechargeable batteries
They just kill the daynothash ahead

So, how do I get the next paintball plant on the block

Project CARS

Better watch out than something revolutionary is coming

Scratch that, match match match
As the years go by, the field starts to look pretty pretty

I mean somebody has to start calling the cops

Quadruple
