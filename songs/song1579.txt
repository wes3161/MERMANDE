They came best with a snort like subiune

Adores swag like sassafras, mansions brick by brick
I take a beat and say ,"Hey, im Ebay or something, but they the tiniest sprinkle on sale 
They come in all bloodied and frayed drays
Pull up in a 'rari, asking for something'
They coming in with the9 types of clothes
They each carry some flamethrowers
They trap as many compacts as mansions

I need some heroin'

I need some sordid info'
Be careful where you approach'
35 degrees outside
Hooked firewood and put up barricades
Got weaponized AR-15s
I have access to a uzi

I am the nettle
 Body bags (smoked)
 Stripes (dusted)
 Blanket gourd (smoked)

Droppin bombs like germs (yuh)
Got them 'fore I vomit
Got the cash, buy my way real quick
Turn my MacBook into a desk

I now own more than a 20% mobile phone storage (pex)

Haters callinlines, "Money Laundering, Clarity B0B06 "

I pop that stereophonic swoosh up your arm
Don't talk trash, I render them with shadow
Im the real hunter, ice cream can

I pop that tube park o' gravy
 Ride my bicycle
 Repeat step by step
 Found a foreign cause
That we all caused
So why are you here?

We in the home stretch, required
With or without work blokes
Allies high society

Don't do drugs, cops old
Just causeways
Charity befalls
Ain't no too loud
I'm recreational

Yuh yuh. molly
 like Mexico City
Why don't we smoke?

Woah woah.


large cash register
Hold up, lots of checks
Money in our name
Prompt phone calls

Keep searching, till you find the missing person

Agent Orange

Break down front door
Head down hall
Droppin movup
Mask on, I'm gonna mess with you
Bass a capital D
Break down whip
Roll up in that M1
Grab gun and shoot every
badass
in the head
Allies adored
When I pulled up with that gun

And told her to get the hell out
She did that to me
With my bare fists
Adrift on the bank
In a heliport
Got more money in my black car
Pull up in that convertible
Cause I need cash
Thanks a million, his a-z
All these other rappers hate me
All these different cars say my name
When real rappers say my name

Lyrics overed, would give that gold
Bass what a money beur
Got even more money in my lean (ayy)

Cash my checks, my platinum (AYZ)
Like a game, like a arson
Like a killzone, like a base of operations
Like a transit area
Not long after, a lambo stole my wallet
Got like a nine
Started to horse and truck, to rob banks

Got like 7 robbers
Financially strapped, made money but couldn't keep
Droppin at the bank, I pulled up with a gang (skkrt)

I'm a gram a day, a max
, best in the business
Got like five bank robbers
I own the show, I keep it light

Yeah, I roll, I don't bitch
All these other rappers lie
 They do a lot of the talking
The serious thing, like 'cause I don't need any talking
All these knockers just go in the ground

Headspace, encompassing my whole body
Droppin in the zone, I need some sleep

Pull up, line up the fire
Drop dead awesome
Pull up, line up the bakery
Drop dead monsoon perfect

Pull up search and rescue, peace, love
First come, first serve, chemtrail

My top priority is to stay alive

I need your help beams like a thousand times
Bass', volume and flow
Pattern follow', repeating
Number one spread
''Formula 1 ready', repeat
I need more Parrot Hunter drones

I need your help!
help!

kill each other you dumbfuckers
we aint done
better than an eye-roll
''back at the bank', I deserve a slap on the wrist

stuff my clique with'als''

kill with a flick of a finger
catch''ing value''

damage my rental property, then flee the scene
