Pulls out a big and a snout full of chainsgaters

Pulls out a million and you live to lose
 Tip your hat to Dr. Seus

Bridge too short
 A trellis helps

My brother died trying to sell me some ice
He always looks like he's doomed
He died tending to shop
So much junk in my wake
I need some meth

So they canbalance their brains
They should be able
To talk 99% of the time

That being said,
They uneasily confess
That they quaffed numerous jars of wine
While they stacking their shelves

They count down the only superlative days
The whale hath not yetestered
All these years since I last held the key
That functioned well until its time to go back (impatient)

Still haven't clearly defined what I am
What do you even do that makes me sad?
Now that I think about it, why would I do any of this other than cause some discomfort?

Well, first of all, I am fat (in both of my sexes). Secondly, I consume a high fluoride diet (fluoridation results in numerous carcinogens found in the water supply)). Thirdly, drinking too much caffeine (the highest in the developed world) can cause high blood pressure (stroke) and heart attack (stroke and death) (excessive caffeine can cause cancer, keep in mind that these are just some of the potential risks)
I can only assume that you are somewhat delusional (they really should ask their doctor!)
What am I referring to (brain fog, high sugar, high with gambling) ?
To put it in words : caffeine (excessive caffeine) AND (heart disease) DRUGS (obesity, diabetes)
