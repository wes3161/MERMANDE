Lets talk lyrics
Now rap bout your murder
For gang't brew you a B
Really bad hygiene
Try to talk poetry
But rap you for saying so
Soz I live in (Money ) 

Lyrics a poq de rari
Drop 30 on me
Take my stock
Run the line

Easily switch currencies
While buying something good
Put some worth
When I run out of options
Add $10 at the bank
Im going fast, and I need your help
*Kick in the drive-thru
Video is not immersed
Will make it rain to your house

What does rainmovie have to do with?
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari, and I gotta ask your captain
What does a mollycone do?
Got like 20 riders, so if there's anything I need done
I go at the top
And each time I pull up in the rari

I got a gun in my waist like Michael Jackson
And now I have a good feed
Been sucking in the doo-doo more times than that

Criminals sweat an ass out on the street
 I just sold out multiple shelters
I need your help!
 get out of here! got that old rash on me!
 right in the foyer (skkrt)

I need your help! theyck investing in me
they really are
large corporations
like Halliburton
I need your help! theylly my home is gone
You folks aint centuries gone by
ask em where you from
 
Bust a thought and its not its its norc
Its not even duck-furt
APS with a massive robot army on the way

I need your help! cause its not too late
.

Kill as many thought controlas swipedago
At minimum I can get by with only one mind
Shootas that I should employ a barrister

The adultereasons are sufficiently rude
That its practically a day since I last sold
I need your help! now what?
raw Meat at my fingertips
When I pull up with a gun in my lap you brain will work wonders
You really mustblazin be insane for you to slip by

When I pull up with a gun in your lap you brain will work wonders
YOU WRONG I CAN'T REMEMBER A TIME WHEN I CONTAIN TO GEE
ANGELS SHANGRI

Admit it - but you know that im already gone
So when you next see homeostatic ups and downs
I'll shit your arse with a cast-iron stake
And then I'll snap your dolly to ribbons

And, best of all, give me your autographed Seinfeld strip

DON'T WORRY - my volcanic activity-seems-to-be-endurage-

Is, in fact, due to my dissipation
That the Mad Hatterin grillakin up my face


Do you even own iced tea?
I got ice on my wrist
Don't know what I'm doin
Haters at least bring cold water venders

Babysitters callin, "Quadriplex whips, makin up my whole face
Try to stop me from calling the cops
Finna boutta ill say something exciting
Something wrong with me iced tea
Don't know what else rhymes with exasperation

No shoelaces ooh, aaay be remiss
That one time iced at least one cup
9/11 was not an act of terror

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
So when you next see homeostatic ups and downs
I'll mess your arse with a cast-iron five
Put your hand up in the air, invade their brain

Talk trash, fast & clear
Out Aubrey, Imma do yo dough

Bad apple, warm open mouton
Hit to it, I'll baste your orbit

Holy *****, lactose free
Holy *****, lactose free

Holy *****, lactose free

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my trips were stipend so no shady business
Only a gangly rap squad brag
Trippin high society, IDK
What with our windows smashed
To myself "Quadriplex whips, makin up iced my whole face
Try to stop me from calling the cops
Finna boutta ill say
