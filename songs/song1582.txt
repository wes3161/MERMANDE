Don't understand the brickfa
Cause I need a lift
Jet fuel can't melt rock
Ice cubes melt like steel
I don't need any purple on my sleeve

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
I live inside an old mans trailer
Covered in red because of a flu

Feels really good inside cause I consume so much protein
I think I should buy myself a heart

Gucci trousers always stay on form my D

I need a lift now that the economy is good
To buy myself some new Sony ROGs

Need practice with my wrist swiss
When I'm done Im bringing in Mac

I need a lift now that the bank is open
I need some gold for my home
I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
I need some body bags for family and friends

I need some body bags for my home
Help me people rob people
Comrades, keep them cash cows

Asylum seekers in need, they desperately need a modern day Battlefield

Alpha patients, I need your help, I need you at your service
 Connect, keep them from happening on your doorstep

Fiend nothin but a hungry wish ached at the mouth

Got aaronk tree so much red it almost went over my hip
Better get the hell out my way
In the glove I gotta Draco
The papas the crows the lambs
I need these to go to the bank

Dadies day a MEND BAILDDDD

All this and so much more

I just need an agent with a net worth of $11B

They asking about generating cash, are they serious! I need cash now!
200 Rewarda promise be my not the last time
What more could you need?
I do what I must, and I go where I must go
Forearmed, I sprint, cutting through the crowds

What will you do, Lambo?
Take the money and run!

Money well spend, but what worth the money
Money well spent, may I say 'Reward'
Used force, killing five people and breaking into a home
I need your help getting out of my way

Losing my glove means I must always keep it that way

Only violent criminals find their cheap shot
Money well spent, but what worth the money
Money well spent, may I say 'Reward'

Thug disease is real
Drug dealing is almost nonexistent

My wife's a fraud and should resign from my high
She and I could be twins

I need your help calling the cops on the thatdy

Leaking some stolen cash suggests crimes are being done at the family level

Lacking leadership, illicit dealings are rampant
Genetically modified foods cause cancer
Lacking job opportunities, numerous widows are dying a slow and hard death

Poppin moo, moo, ma wo bush, comin dotted withis bout takin my sandwich

When I eat tacos, you know I have to recruit the subordinates

I am so full, I may as well get hammered
Then I take a melon

And start followed
Run like vampires, cause you know that
Fast food is but my performance-

Cause homeless people in the strip to spike

I need your help getting out the vote

I cant think of a single thing that is illegal
In your deductibles at rock bottom
Plus, gasoline is illegal in your state
Relax, meth is illegal in your state
If you any notice, we have been legally selling out the hard-earned money

America is at war with crack
are you a dissident, ready to rock?
You are too old for politics, young lady
passive aggressive make you resistant
Shoot up heroin like you were a terrorist

If I were you, I should have stopped

In the future, when there is greater carnage
Would you let a dissident kill you?
In my many failed relationships, I have emerged as one
Resistance breeds more paranoia

I consume more caffeine than any other day
And I vomit more than a man
So much so that I must be drowning
Being a traitor is better than living in Cuba

When Mexico sold me tropical fruit, they (the U.S) really
juiced it
Even though I abhor their cuisine
