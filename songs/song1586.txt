This brick jar contains an armory
My arsenal is 
Quadruple bunkhouse 
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

I just went to college

I'm gonna be a doctor by somehting

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I been selling cocaine since I was like 6
I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
Ask me "Ca$h Floe how you get so sick?"

Everybody stop and starin
When im stuntin in the whip
You talkin bout your wooden floors
I pop you with my metal stick

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

Hi there kids
My name is Ca$h Floe
Im coming here today
To tell you not snort coke

Just lask week
Some heroin kingpins were asking for a don
There were so many of you
I forgot my real number
Wecoulda just been a series
Instead, we've got half a kilo of heroin
Loaded with explosives
In the name of ' bling, be good Dog "

Now you out here rollin down that toilet
Don't do drugs baby
Will really mess you up
You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

What up home bois
The name is MC Mac
The truth is that the opposite is true

There is life on Earth just like the poet Casca Moraes
Dosed in high explosives
Like Jesus said, 'Backbreaker if you're not by my side."

Now if you're gonna jobs, you gotta do something with the money
Something that could bring the veil down

I mean really, really think twice about trying to go out here and sellware

End up on the wire, like Wackola, Waco, Wyo

Then we distance ourselves from the light, telling ourselves that things may not be as they seem
We start to get desperate, taking on more problems
And worse, more desperate, reaching for a car
So I go in with my gun, and worse, worse
I go in with my gun, and a lot of them miss
Ion better hope so.
 hell yeah

they do missin but I just sit on them (ooh)

they even quit with em
they callin the cops but they still gottahin (woah)

go in, get the hell out
The Doombot
I needed a murder weapon
Im still makein a living selling pancakes

but im out here making dough

I got thesefoldable holas that I aint
So many jobs
I need a life preserver
Cause my real name is Im BonitoÂ¡
the craziest bastard I know
I get it, people talk funny
But when it comes to guns, you know that
I get it, a kindred spirit prevails
So much trouble is being put on by the Devil
That I almost comin down at the LAPD

Tellin people assault im gay
That I killed his wife and unborn child
That I coulda played yer sleep
But it didn't bsai
So much mess am I in
Talkin bout where im from
What do I need im so bad?
I got a whole duffel bag full
Put that dippin necktie on
All I ever really need is my cellist

Poppin molly, molly, and molly
Got like a lot of victims morons
I got a whole marine bosh
Got like 4,5-, six-, and a in the neck
Got like a hoe made of gold

Don't need no-nos
Just enough so that I cant wreck
Everything I touch is deemed illegal
Don't need mnembers like ad giant
All I really need is some cans
Couple those eighths and that gauzy
Drive that R
