I have a lot of whips, practise 'til I have enough
And lock them when I need them
When they spot your defense, attack

They call me Wackowski because I shoot at them from the hip
As they are hit, they either run, duck, crawl, skip, roll, hop, crawl

I rely on these whips almost daily

When an illegal substance is found in my blood

While refusing to sell drugs

I present a more palatable and sinister name

And that adjective hits the deep end



When an illegal substance is found in my blood

While refusing to sell drugs

I am the real deal
 Prepare to trip
 Your border defence system is on
Your life goes in your compartments
