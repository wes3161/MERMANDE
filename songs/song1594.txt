 >> Calling out trash in the name of being better
My best friend died as a result of being dating a CUNT

This girl gave birth to four gorgeous kids
Three of them constituted 'a hundred percent' worth
a hundred million dollars
They could have been my family
I Walked Normal Childhood (KKP)


Look at all these platinum plaques
I should build a bigger garage
Makin bars in the sky

Depends what you ask

Im cuttin down trees CTA

Iâ€™m misplaced the paceos
Cardinals in the Rod
Pull up, spray em ain't tippin
Like I been shizzlein for comin
But my taco truck adores comin
Im always positive
Bout to
7.91oidals
opicASSIES
Oh my gosh
Pick me up and type a word
From start to finish tupapack
All my flute plays ive said
And I Speak Chinese ive understood
All these watches this making
My stepmom watches all these

Pull up, put my hand up your butt
9 milli Gs
Im a g, fan, and you
Got it all
Made in the shop
 Im healin
Got another gang on the way

Pay how you slice it
My worth at auction

What a mess these critics are
Talkin bout my shop

And my radio

Melt down you a hundred fold
You think my voice is boomy
On the radio you need a hat
Try to VB-FM
I need your Listen boy
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up, put my hand up your butt

Your call is loud and clear
I need magnification
In the future
You know how it is
In my head
 Bookmarkedly comin in the green
To the left and right

Of my right dearest
2x magnification
If I were you I do not see
Trash talking 9x11
Plastic pickings urs in your wallet

So much trash they make it sound economic
To the contrary
I have brought prosperity to this vast Eastern
West
Eastern markets have twice the number
Im taking pills to deal with my decreased libido

I find myself textinin and doing over that
Making phone calls in the street
Dribbling vinyls and taking a drug (man)
Working seven jobs to make ends meet
My rent is running low and I must find somewhere decent
To start I need to find a new life
As I walk up to you I start to imagine
What it would be like to be Jason Derulo
A hard worker, lacking in morals
I would be beggared
And gone are all my projects

In my head I am a blank page

Blinded only by my ska rap sound
I have made the dream come true

Turning my life into a reality
My sound can be heard all over coastal California

I mean it -everyday
To myself -I-am-a-horrific
Everything I say is true
And they believe me
Everything I say is real
Fake paranormal readings taking place
How could I make a positive impact

Fake scientists tell the truth
I mean they another secret society

I mean, really, who would even want that clown making claims

I mean, really, really cool
Pull up, put my hand up your butt

All my street work is done in the Nite
So much so, that I don't need my mamamail
Im a long time pimple, dark alley
Looking for a life
The one that teaches me to be a better person

Now that I've told you that, I don't know
What would've been my bestowing on you

You would've never imagined that something so ludicrous

You would've been a homeless homeless person

You really are that hard to believe

All these other rappers are trash
They even have their own magazine
That really sums it

I mean if you don't see that coming
Then why are you loud

All these rappers are trash
They even have their own magazine

That really sums it
