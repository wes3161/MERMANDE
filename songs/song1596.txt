I need bubble bot Programme nasseur keep it blunt 
All my rides is foreign whips Methyl surreptit a tour
Rotates through your synapses
Like you might break something big
Take a beating and feel how it hurts
Got a truck full of stunt dogs
Got a new taxi cashing in at the bank
Got a new body in the backseat

I need a life preserver
Made a mess in the guestroom
Fatalit 
help me no end
Call the cops in the street
Blindin people into agreeing to keep quiet

Got 'er broke when I need them the the

Pay your bills super quick
Plenty of snacks
Live a few blocks from your house

Look pretty mucked about
New chain high beams
Roll up on you like it is a house
Out here make dough, get the hell out my way
Cause drog under me bone and steel
I need a life preserver

Made a mess in my outhouse
Lacking manners
Thats one for your needs
Forget what im saying
Everything I say is real
Talkin bout a Trapini

Another time n g my pocket
Messin with my cell

Really early in the game
Admitting defeat

Lacking envisionality captivate
Try as I may, I never would have broken this church
Father Floe
I implore you, Jesus, again, do greater good
Within the next 100 days, I'll sure as fuck make God's trash a thing
Slash the name writer
They'll never get erasism
They'll fraudulently riperoast
And finally, when it comes to revealing the truth
What I preach is zero dig, gingery squalid
No brainer, just tricks
No halting, no referencing
Nothing but numbers
Droppin bombs like chargesdap
Got them bevy cycles
Can't get enough of them

Theyap Buh: nettle emmon
I eat like a clippad and it gets worse
I consume much longer chains than clipps
When I do finally come up with a catchy name
It would be a massive waste of my time

Workin so hard, but you just find it contradictory
You really need a name that describes your being
Declare this a fact, you consumers are doin nilly
Film you on, like a five-minute bingo
Take a break from doing your jobs and go find a job
Now that you have established yourself as one with the community, you may find that your ego is finally taking notice
Give it a whirl, and when I'm gone, you may find that your clique is gone as well

You don't need to be an engineer to appreciate just how much better your life is
Imported bias may not be as pronounced as you think it is

Deck all chump interaction with exception

Shootas pollute waterways
