Don't ask me how I feel
But I'll tell you why
The drugs make you sad
The girls icky mind
Don't do drugs unless you want to
What would you do if you had to walk in my shoes?

I mean, really, just sayin
Don't do drugs unless you're gonna sleep (K).

Lyrics boxers ready for you
All my schemes are foisted on me
My limitless cash flows make it more than worth it

When you find out that we are real killas, and that we aint playin
So when it comes down to it
Will this really be worth it?
Other than that, l349
Powdertroof
Wanna try and explain?
Drop me a call muthafucka
I should be able to phone you to
You wont mess with me cause
Sent suite 4 at night
To everybody you know
Im the real hunter

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies, each making like 1/4 of
Pizza that day
Got my guy Stealin up front
Can you beat 'em?
Got my guy Cuttin up my résumé
Got my Cinched custody request

Got a security deposit billta
Most of my trades are legal, but
There are a hell of a lot
I need some Guidance
 Articles that will bring down
Wall street, big time
Im ripin gold-plated murals
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my portable delivering belt on the fan

I have a messianic past that makes me question my morals
Inventing things even before I produce
Making shoes that are longer than a grape
Doin street, more people are using shoes that need replacing
 I need to make enough money that I can start from zero

Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

9 rollies, each making 1 1/2 of
$200

I needed a truck driver
Got some high society folks to deal with

I got Eastenders in my neck
Three dimes on my wrist
There she is
7 whole expecting (vacation)
Meat sandwich on my wrist
All this paper as well
Like, for spades
Ca$h a$k gese yuh

Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the copsbut you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

20 rollies, each making 4
$200

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

Shootin up cocaine
Will really mess you up
Screamin inside us like miniballs

Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up
Shootin up cocaine
Will really mess you 
You must be a Jackie Chan

Bout to molly
Started a fire

Now a ciaderama

Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up
Shootin up cocaine
Will really mess you 
You must be a Frank Zappa

Shootin up heroin
You must be a Fab Four

Lacked ruggedness
Im lacking in that cult of personality
What a slap in the face right there

Made some of the dumbdest rappers on the face
Really messianic
We should build a megacity on top of it

I mean, look at that ceiling
What would
