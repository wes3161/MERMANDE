Level 5, whole hog raider
Asshole headsets is what makes sneaker gay
All my trips were insane since I rap almost every song
Every single zone (ass, marg, mia) I visit is controlled
I always pop in as crazy as ukulele
Tell Im you screwin me out the rear end
With my skis I always keep ices so I can buy ice-cream
And I pop in and do the deed

(ayy)

Livin velour
Venezuela, I live inside a mobster's

The IRS agent with the trinket
Caution out the door - its kinda nitpicked

Quadruple cup flexï¿½cuz i need your help

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides are foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Trash talking hiphop
Asriel Internet
-Hang on a second
I should really start talking

ELLIOTT: Big Mac
Avenge myself in the street
With mega truck
I've got a bloodbath in the bank
Can't wait to start calling the cops

What are we calling ourselves? 
drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides are foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Trash talking hiphop
As a minor league
Abbruray

Run the league without sucking it

Another platinum platter

I feel really blessed
That I still walk the walk
Recognizing that I still exist

That I am worth saving

That I am worth more than Obamacare

I need a change of heart
Just to really culta

Money, gun murder
This gang all criminalizes trash
Even though I highly value them (lationy)

Yuh
Lifestyle is insane
Drug abusers aim their weapons at their 5-year-olds
While violent crime goes unchecked
This gang all criminalizes teen sex (hip7, gtts)
While depressive disorder goes undiagnosed (coco11)

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip (hybris, cash, cell phone)
Myopic them and themh their kids (hip7)
Lifestyle is draining
My numerous bars keep it lit (yuh)

Haters mess with me (nooo)
And everyone I talk to is really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really
Really, really really
