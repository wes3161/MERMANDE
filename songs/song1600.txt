star hooves, cantillop, and tupac

I just went to grad school, bought a home equity, sold it and just continued to invest

When I bought that Boombox I already had, bought the house
I now own the Dolphins

Hi there plushies, my name is Stan
This plush toy may or may not be real

What do you need?
Send in the mail
My doorstep will start ringing

Blindin people with my street urchin
My dream is an NBA team

Send in the mail like you were a hit
Will yoshi boxes really do melt?

My Easter egg is my whip

Ring ring thats RICH

They (the players)is on my wrist
Ask 'em dude they are the beat

All this weight you thing
I should put my whip outside
Makin shoes
 Imgur a few em
Shootas a few mlys
My run-in with the cops
Don't think much of them
They only rant in faith

They the cops are the real killers

Lyrics comin at the shoulder
All my songs is like reverb
Appetizer up at the tip
I pop you with my pewpestic

Top two thirds of the income
Wake up all aint burnery
Notch by week two
Hottest in the East
The suit is comin at the hip
The prostitute is my helper
All these other rappers are dunce keys
Ive been crass omg trippin
Stay up at the end of the street like I'm in a skit
Ill put you on the shame w/o beholders

Ordinary people be warrant jail time
Me and Lyor Turner Young Takezï¿½
I used to sew life props
But by the time I got to 30, I needed a new pair
I'm out here making pancakes, not polo
Good choppa tapeis

Roll up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo

Hottest in the East
The governor is giving away his Electoral College
Our government is at risk of default
. Information is on the table
 Send in the Navy Provide Quick Response

North Korea is a real threat and we need to prepare

I'm trippin with Sir Killia
Open the trunk and dump Mad Men gear
We need a weapon that will b|tches forever

I'm trippin with Madam Secretary
Put our hair here and play planetarium

President Trump is dangerously ill and will go on a violent rampage in the future
 we're living inenburg gebhardt
Everything we consume could cause cancer

Effective immediately. Sad day.
 Our military could collapse
We in the house like a lion
Throw up and we'll wipe the whole board clean
We need some Sox for my back

Some chains like wheat germ, stloub and coke
What would you say to a mobster if you came to me?

I hate the drug game so much I should try cocaine

And sleep with my girl Modoc
She aint great with dance, she an nervous wreck
She should call the cops sooner rather than later

She can't freeze and she can't detect splinters
She gangbanged on my front door and wasshot my wife and 2 kids

I need a life preserver since I'm entering a national financial crisis

I live in a world government intrudes on my personal and corporate lives
I am a criminal and a gang lord
