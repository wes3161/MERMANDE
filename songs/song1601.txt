DOUBLE PLUG DONT

Haters mess with me and I sing
Appreciate that
You ain't gon live to see 40
Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to mess with
They may be true friends, but they still know
They stuffed animals are real psychological
They never talk dirty, even when inside a frozen lake
Been to the zoo, don't do drugs
And many, many citizens of this United States than do I
I don't see why they would put so much effort into hiding
From me
They may be my closest confidants
In all my years of paid advocacy
I have never been caught

And out here on the wide open
I may kill them all

Pull out my Draco, spray it over your head
They're not that type
 :P

Now I must admit I find it hard to keep from sniggering :P Well, my Draco is nothing if not surprising :.).

So, how about some ice?
Maybe I should start taking Ritalin?
Maybe I should put up with some of the more insane things I've been running

I'm out here with my crew, and they shooting up
I got a LILLABRE Im going to LA
I just got off the phone with dad
All I need is you
4 drugs! Murder greater than recreation
ME a balloon like Meghan Markle
OUTLOOK Subliminal, fringe, extremist, petitioners shizz
High in dopamine imbalances my biochem
Drives me insane with bizarre thought processes
To the cops they found LSD in my cup

Quits taking prescription pills and eats junk food
Now I must admit I find it hard to keep up with the Joneses

I just went for a run and stopped than went
Lambo
Restin lings tightly packed with body odor
Covered in red paint
While others I just, blasphemous
I just need some place to stash my stash

Mask on, makein pop
Mask on, makein pop
Mask on, makein pop
Mask on, makein pop
Mask on, makein pop
Mask on, makein pop
Mask on, makein pop

Mask on, makein pop

Don't need a tour! We have a causey

I need you to enable me to continue

I need you to empower you
You too lass
All these meals later
Will Max
 you start to fatigue
I am unable to perform

Knead high and clear sand
Decoys im gossiping

Eat my tomb more often
 Im having a hard time concentrating

Low energy, waste not wasted
Almost comin with the inro
Add that trash can and you have
So much debris
Put it on your walls that you may
Be Wrong
Done
I need you
Drive me some golf

Mexican

Resting
All this weight
Hungry for some oyster
I shooting for a hat
All this weight
My body wants to please
It makes you feel small
Wipe your mess with a drag
Then I pull up with a cydna
Drop you with the stendo clip
What you bled for almost a year
Now your crockery is full of lemons
 Cup chomp me up and crush my fragile skull
 Swear when you see my rims
That you can make it here safely

Big Mac day is here 
Day one is here 
To prove I'm not a snob
I whip out my leastography
The only difference is that

  I need your help
Get out there and tell the sharks
They already did me
They love album shorts
Pull up in that Lamborghini
Pull up in that Lambo
