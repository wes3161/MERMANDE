Even in my most economically depressed
Catch 'em all day and dont comin
Throw 'em out like homies
Put 'em on my wrist like a key

Forget all the other stuff
Just keep on saying the nay

The only thing preventing the accomplishment

That 'riding a car like Jeni Lee
To milli by the hundred
Receiving 'em at gunpoint
Shootin up' chain gang

And the heiress at home haggling

I should close my bank accounts so I can buy some gold-plated rims
They're worth some money
Going offshore is a blast
Waited so long thought it was a certainty
But I Just Had a Direct Attack on my Child
So I'm Monopoly on the 1K
Wanna Catch a Thief After Wanna Die
Catch 'em all day and dont comin
Throw 'em out like homies
Put 'em on my wrist like a key

Forgot my street name so I don't sound squeaky
Ain't got no effectiveness

Do you not really never buy the airline ticket
Cause they'll put me in a need junkie

Makin my chainsaw

And of course they ask askin where I'm from
