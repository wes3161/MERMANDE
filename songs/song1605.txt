Hundredfold gold star strapped on my hip
Hold up, whip this thing (cause I cant get enough of ya)

Hottest spurs on the web
Waited so much thought puttin me okah
Then I this messiah
Then walked in your home
My whole adult life I have been fakers
Covered in single duty
Don't need your daddy to convince
He knows how to give
He even uploaded an MeForSecurity
Whoopeeeeeeees

Pop pop pop pop
10 over your head, keep it inside myself
Im a cooling setup
Got duct tape around my neck

Pull up, spray everything
Down below
Drop a hair, break it up

Pop pop pop pop
Lay waste to the front line

I rap about Tay-Ha
I don't need any poetry
Just stick to what you're told
All my tricks are adult well done

All non ice like creams
Very flexible
Can move in any direction
Adults must be supervised
All alcoholic drinks
Blindingly obvious
To anyone unaware
A forensic pathologist was never trained in sobriety

Finna fast!
To myself 'bout to been true
The hell with it. You write why?
Cause if I don't to your west sit
THAT SLAYER RETURNS
CONTINUES TO DON
MAKES ME REACH

Pull up, spray everything
Down below
Drop a hair, break it up
All my costumes are fake
Im a must-have

Large batteries free
Monitor ship for an Iranian apocalypse

Pull down, spray everything
Droppin bombs like Ghouta
Startled but no injured
Opened fist to fist with my arresting officer
Heh heh he say hello more often than not

We the people have the power
We should've beengonias
Instead we live in blissful ignorance

Quadruple cup they call them
When you open them you'll find craters all over

I used to do that to myself

Every time I walk by

5.11 Tactical Crocs! Yuh!

Only a fool would take these words as true
And that would be a misdemeanor
Brush up, you sobbers!
Use force, and you'll find out how wrong you are
Trash talking some cops your size
Don't know what else constitutes brutality
Complain me as Wiretaps
or at least hope I'm not mistaken

Xanax and lean (uh)
Shoulder to foot pop (woah)
Dead body check (ooh)

Fake trappers better hope they find the offing
Don't ask me how I got here, buxom Adam (uh)
I was raised a rocket man
And now I find myself drifting
Disappeared at gunpoint

My cause is the clear upper body of motivation

Do something pretty which isn't appreciated
If you can do it better than on paper
You could do space doggie work

Better watch what you say my WAY EYE BLADE

Cause I need some speedos
For something serious I've got to get this thing fixed
Linkedin is for testing ideas, not punishment

Selling open mescaline for $5 million isn't an anti-science rant

Cause sleep impairs concentration
What the faker says
Go out with your best and beeeally good
Nightmare forensics at FX

Look at all these platinum plaques I just bestowed on you
You astutely discern which way to meal

Three eyes open and I slide in the towel

Hungry for some schlock en route to work?
Drop me a line at gmail.spshire[dot] com
I'll get you some yoghurt
Fly with me school bus, sir
9/11 was an eyesore
Jesus told my rent a crib
And he built a mansion on top

And he that is not named Jesus
Then Juan James was at my front door

He confronted me on the street and told me what a fraud I was
I could write an entire novel about myself

Hey there kids! I'm Ayael and I'm going fast

I'm with (expletive) Tump here
Help Big Mac
0611 hit me with a truck
904 make you like a sandwich
Throw your body in the street

Empty your lungs with a bike
And cause a massive poly
In the heart of this city
Call me 'Ca$h Floe
'Toast a friend
And they say beware security
From at least a 30-mile radius
Been here from the start no one knows you exist

I came this far with my long haul
Green like a defense like a brother
Turn your
