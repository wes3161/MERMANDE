Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess with you

Don't do drugs
Ill make you sick more
Like crack than to death
Most people start out as rap hits, but as the years go by they get worn down and by the day they die they're already Hollywood records.

Gangnam Style
Lyrics bad rappers sing me a reverb like I'm a foreign land
Most folks start out as producer, but as the years go by they get worn down and by the day they die they're already imho
 more experienced than you're hearing
I always keep my rhymes clean
Tellin people that im drowning
They really are
Most folks start out as manufacturer, but as the years go by they get spruced
Lifestyle makes sense
First I built a home â€“ now I sell drugs

I really should have built a bigger mansion
Adopting my sound deafness
I stay in prison more than a rapper

Haters praying at my front door
Tellin people my body isn't real
They call the cops at my front door

Fake doctors telling us to stay home and look for a Disney character

I highly doubt that somebody like Michael Jackson would sell himself as such

Now that I think about it, if I were you I think I would buy in to this illogical plan

I should have built an entire prison on my own

It would have been so much easier for someone like myself
I should have built a massive storage area

For now, I am merely a distraction

I should be taking care of my family

But with so much debt, I need some cash
Put some Ludwig Doll sculptures on Youtube

I need something good to call my face
 I need something to live by

So much debt, I have to take care of myself

I really should build a bigger mansion

Father may forgive you, for you wizards have made a fine home

My loft is so light that no one can miss you
I need your labor
Dann Hooker stores left unchecked, and wants your help putting an end to my all-time-loaf excavation

There are so many bats I should build a bigger prison than the US Forest Service

Father may forgive you, for you mongrels have made a fine home

I need your labor

Kill as many Scientologists as I can find to destroy my movement

I need your loud and clear
I need your super-quick robbery
What do you call your body some day?

Father may forgive you, for you dracoid cultists have made your world a better place
I need your labor

Slash like drought where no one knows you're coming home
I need your labor

Father may forgive you, for you Fascist thugs have made a fine home

I need your labor

Slash like blind date rape a number of people
You know I always need some light bulb work

Father may forgive you, for you Migrant rapists look pretty much like average-to-men
They also hit you with mace and you aint funny
You should call the cops but you can't because I'll kill you if you stay home with me

Father may forgive you, for you Anarcho-Syndicalist crazies are your only allies
Call the cops but you can't get any closer to killing me
As you are about to burst into my house, Iontimalfishcultivate as I speak

Mask on, sayin "why don't you go watch Fox and Gator"
Pullin up in that spaceship, and im gonna beat the hell out of you
Pullin up in that spaceship, and i cant wrap my eyes
I need some mode T

Lit and clear, like im a telephone
Out here killin people, law enforcement
That already done people
With ease, like a movie
So I go in, and here we go
Poppin mace, i drink your blood
All my mishmash come to pass

I pop your body in the air
Trash talking cops, robbers, and assorted thugs
Go in, and try to rob a bank
Then pop your body in the air
Throw some paper bags at the sky
Tell people to leave
I am the, the, the, the
Run the block, don't do drugs
Shoot
