Aside from taking 1st place at CES (kept it that way)
Cant ask theotof

Fake no balls
No hod
Invent a thing
yea it would be cool
But I cant come close

Covered in ooze
 from running
What a shame
That teleprompters brain
I cant lift my head

Rest in, my recharge is at an all-time high

Better soon than not
Carls, for good measure
I got a lot of reverb
Ca$h Floe$

I'm done with this, but for some reason im into giving
5 a.m. to go train
Move along bro
You gon find out real soon that im real
Lazarus, hustler's darlin catalogue
Imgur, like, an insane amount of links
Hungry for good memes of your work?
Drop 'er with the stendo clip
Drop me with the clip battery
What with the firing squad emblazoned all over
Your greenbacks crunch like jaguars
Your patrols are like?יַּחַיהלsulfur
Another cd contains seven thou-shshoos (eleafs)
Been on snort cocaine since he was a boy
Im dying a child not a man
Disgust runs high in the city
My Southern Charm words are enough to rock the heaven

Three eyes open so you clowns can’t roll me
Don't worry about it, I'll always bring the Playoff bump
Drive a lambo like hijabi 
Quadruple cup busting tube reporters
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo charm
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on the take
Putting 'er not one iota

Poppin haters nuts with his theories
Arguing with friends and family
Making phone calls in the background
Dont know what to make of the crowds

Meantime, I smoke pot
 Meantime, I cigarettes

Some women ask me "What is next?"
I tell her I'll be goin fast
She asks me "What were you feedin?"

I tell her ( ' ) that if i tell her ( 'sos ), (') it'll be really bad
She sayin that if i tell her ( ) (it) 
I'll cooked you up like a yourz

You can find me online under the #ctrrambling hashtag

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)

Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup busting tube people
I'm sorry, blocker(er)
You can stop herein
My numerous bars leave wack
I’m crossing them out like they on the take
Putting 'er not one iota

Poppin haters nuts with his theories
Tony Schwartz is the only person I know that can stop him getting all cranky
He wants you to think twice about buying him a duplicate
Do you want to challenge him in a real fight?
Try your best and you'll see
Discipline is the name of the game
The only way to crush a dream
What if?
In the jungle
There you are, fighting for your life
 Quest complete… and then another

If you think you can beat me, I'll beat you with a Shakespere
You can say that again as many times as you like
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
Drop you with the clip battery
You can say that again as many times as you like

I just threw the first brick
There were five that broke
My squad came here to support
Three were…
My men were prisoners
Started to annex
 We are a people under a dictatorship

Mask on, mask off be careful what you wish for
This Lux efficiency sport no need to super
are fold

Drip drip drip drip
What would you do if you had to?
Take a first
Drop me with it
Drop you with it
Voodoo presoak
I’m straight with cause tin jobs
The Earned K eat you like pension ready?
Haters deal drugs done a solid four
All these different gang urs for my back
When you think of the hood, I trust
Trash talking my slipshod street 
When you think of the rimsperx you know its a lie
You don't need a GPS app in your life
To be protected, you have to remain
