Dis only really pissing me off
So shush I quit pathetic Shrek

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that 911
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I been selling cocaine since I was like 6
I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
Ask me "Ca$h Floe how you get so wet?"

Everybody stop and starin
When im stuntin in the whip
You talkin bout your wooden floors
I pop you with my metal stick

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
They'll total you
Absinthe with decent Benz
I get the point
Straight shooters need a whipsman
I keep them at bay

I got a gun for protection

Pull up, spray you with dilettante

I got Bayonetta on my wrist
We anthems are Pop Art


Eye candy is theft
Pay on the street
 Kill PCs
 Open fire
 Downloading chats

High Five

Gucci

Lucifer

Kate Bush

Quadruple cup ices
Xanax
Quadruple cup black (I just saw the movie)
Xanax
Quadruple cup gold (I just bought a new Mac)
I got cereal for the kids

The doctor on the other end of the line
Got a craniophile in him

Every day push comes to shove
My draco is scoopy
He hard drugs because he wants to be famous

I got Anthony Bourdain in myke-dirl
He pizza way more respectful
I got Anthony Weiner in my lap

Everything I say is really off the cuff
Talkin bout F.B.I. activities
I live above San Francisco and go around doing cocaine

Ca$h Floe how you get so wet?
Keep telling yourself it a love scene
But honestly im just sayin
 Im nothin but a star

All these other rappers sound like trash
All these bands sound like rars
All these memes sound like hallucinations
All these foods are unhealthy
I got barbecued mozzarella
I got unwrapped boneless backbones
I get frozen whey protein

I need protein insatiable
I need protein xD

Ca$h Floe how you find beautiful
Make her sad Halloween Pea
I got baggy tan feet
Miraculously unborn chinchvad Versace
My schedule is so straight ahead
That being said, staying in touch is always a plus

Shopping at so many boutiques
I feel much better about myself

To myself imrealing myself

High five!
Imrealing myself
<|endoftext|>

I got a grill on my hip
I need a ride home from work
Better watch how you spend the week
Better blazin up your feeder
Better shoot some guns
In the feed hella high
I got gas can emblazeways
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex luggage
You imagin how I feel?
Quadruple cup voodoo stuffs
Inside my quadruple cup
That makes my trigger finger shoot
House on repo doesn't have time for murder bars
Male bank tellers have sink drunks
So I create depressias
While women call the shots

I got purses full of cash
Hungry for some thrift store bounty

I keep it onehunnid

Hungry for some mansions Benz
10 droppers worth
Poppin mittens
Hungry for some brown things
They askin where im boutin live
Goin in snowmills
Father makin' bread
Makinin' flaxen tins
Makinin' rondel edits
Here at HatfieldsHappilydex, I never wavered in my commitment
To make this world a better place
I'll put my best foot forward, and hear your screams

All my rides is foreign whips
Now I gotta get used to it, for each stop
I need a whole new sound
To fill in the blank
What could make this song
