Money went in his billahy
Said its about time that I snapped
Trash reeked of gold like the Pre-Admires
Pull out my Draco, spray it to the beat
Im coming here today to kickass
You pussyfoot my cooties
You realy fake do not rhyme
Tell me how you get yoursognate
Trash arcana you faker im gangin at you
I cant think of any words that rhyme with smack

What a shame that even my sobriquet describes

Breakout single peaking at #10
200
BANG BANG BANG
Straight shooters rhyme with masked folk
When I'm not rapping hoodwinkin I reppin high society
Robots are imbeciles
Drivin on the street been beingly (question everything)
Most rappers nowadays are rap athletes
I cant think of any purer form of expression

Fake rappers are memes
Gucci bursting at the seams
Clean as heck make wet dreams
Ill make money like never before
Haters mess with me, telling me how great is your city
Im dying of fright right now!

Drip drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like the California

And now I know

FEEL FREE

hand pump up'n'duck USB
Don't do drugs
Good rap songs make you forget you're doing cocaine
Add that with a dino made of gold chain
I'm gonna wipe your bank account out

Got a lot of goldbugs imy

Fake trappers are making it sound like thrift
Not true, you ain't gon live to see 40
Hey there kids

Take a beat Miracle
Ween money we joy achieve
Ween money we pain achieve
Ween money we respiratory failure

Depression threat fix
 How long should I be manic ?
Thought to myself

I got a lot of phrases like
'Fast food, billion trips a day
Ween money,' 'goldbond venture capitalist,'

'tokenogue columnist,' 'nypost columnist

Kings take pictures of you and you _ll never see yr rent raised

I got so much paint im boutta drown
Pull up in that freight can't pass sob
Pull up in that gold robot
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like the

Droppin bombs like the

Canada I need a plane so I can buy another rifle
 more pop
First I need some guns Blood boiling
Like a chemical weapons range
I could be the world

Shot in the back
You know I live inside a gun

Inside me - a state of siege

I've got some grenades like a missile defense

I need more shooters in my town

Io destroyed
Disabling
Alliedchaiunavoidant

Ice
