Everything be put back where it should have been
Out here framing it real fast
Can be a nuisance

Most rappers nowadays are from the Bronx
I've been selling cocaine since I was like 6
I hate the rap scene
Fake rappers are memes
Im making a mess in my life

I should put my body in an ambulance

Fake rappers are not real 
Gucci bursting at the seams
I'm the next Big Mac

You don't need a meg to make money
You like big government and manufacturing? 
You better barricade your windows when you train

I am the last hope of all humanity
All these rappers are trash

Wallet made on private jets
Headless, ready to explode
Shootin up gold, cause we our own moments of helplessness

Quadruple cup lean brains slow us down

Covered in cash
Finna my debt leak
Droppin bombs like Preston more than a thousand times
Got cash all right, but I keep taking
Got cash in myta for pocket
Quadruple cup long and thin
Got cash in the rap game rise above
Your life is a net wasted

Wallet raised, loaded, and on the move
Shootin up some blinders presence way more than a little
You ain't gon live to see another album hit the #1 spot

Wallet raised, loaded, and on the move swing that warth over your chain
