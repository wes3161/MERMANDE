Money kiddies I'm getin draco tasca, get out my crib
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 5, 6, 7 Ton Beverly Hillys
Do you not adore nature?
Plump for a BANGBOT, spray it to the beat
Don't know what else rhymes with buttload of cheddar

No shoelaces I don't trip

Brass-a-masta cruises by your side
Takeout touts the size of DADI ROCKS
I just bought a yacht so I could spend the littlest of blazers
I’ll clear you out like a four-course porridge
And you aint going to want to spend at least $50,000
Wipe my rear with a Martin Pers Cafe
Takeout tabbies your fee for entry
I'll handle any. Anys. Voids.
Front-row denizens strut their stuff, while my back row is bare
Your front row ain't my only cash flow

I can see your face every time you touch my lobe

Don't know what else rhymes with bump
No shoelaces I don't trip

Drop you with the stendo clip

Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Fake it, call the cops!
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You cant do anything but shrug and nod

Like I was super smart
All this wasted money
Robbited auto parts
And refinished houses than looked like they might shop
I heard they were gonna need a home improvement

So I went and bought some gold-plated rims

They were very well done
Pos outside my price range
XENOA DEX NERF
Drivinin in my 'rari
Grindin inside me like Labradils
