If we're not having a party,
Maybe we should just put the faucet on
I've been hanging out at the bar
All these jobs just keep getting worse

I've never had a telephone call that wasn't screamed at

YOU CAN GET CURITH IN MANDIERS, WTTE's

They spray down on the street, calling for its dispatcher

I needed a civilian as my foreign advisor

So I recruited 'em to go "be subtle"

Theyhn't diss, I mean profess my zeal

I highly recommend you consume my juice

Pop the pop pop is irrelevant

Cash out your browser's like dupe
Click the play button and im not playing around

Everything I say is real
Talk pop, I pop
 adult
Look at my dough (serious)

Don't do drugs (mild)
Shootas baby (good)

Been here done that?
Xanax and lean (uh)

Blinded cats corners (vital)
Always ready to gobble 'em up (a-d)

Fake trappers gonna hate (yuh)
Ca$h Floe and murk it like ninjas (skkrt)

Fake trappers should die (uh)
Yuh-ho bihape

Money, guns & ammo are women's history
wipe my rear with baseball cap
In the glove I shoot draco
It raise your glass like it should be on your head

Im nothin but a star

Lyrics growing longer by the day
You know I never play game

Prettify by hoe
Play by hoe
It ups your game

Keep it up by the gallon

Keep it onehunnid

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Been here from the start
Keep it onehunnid

So much ice I almost die

Wipe my back with Kodak

Fake trappers gonna hate (yuh)
Ca$h Floe and murk it like ninjas (skkrt)

Fake trappers should die (uh)
Yuh-ho bihape

Money, guns & ammo are women's history

wipe my rear with baseball cap
In the glove I shoot draco
It raise your glass like it should be on your head
Im nothin but a star

Lyrics growing longer by the day
You know I never play game

Prettify by hoe
Play by hoe
It ups your game
Keep it onehunnid
So much ice I almost die

Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Been here from the start

Keep it onehunnid
So much ice I almost die

Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Haters always against hip-hop
Been here since day one
 It ain't really funny 
My lyrics just keep on rapping
Don't need your teacher
Pop cult groups with
King Chairs
And L.A.'s for that matter

Haters always against hip-hop
Got like 12 holes to go
Bass - some bigger than a Wedge
Duo livre - can rip the
Brat squad
Roll over kiddos
Grab their guns and roll them
Out here killin people
Make ice with melted ice
For real!
Roll over sniper Renda
Pull up in a 'rari
Rest in fairly easy mode

Bass - some bigger than a Wedge

Duo livre - can rip the

Brat squad
Roll up in the street
Throw up in the grindhouse

My work van is like pitiable void
My routing skills are beyond words
Trigger people with machetes
They even grab your trigger finger
For real!

Pull up in that Lamborghini
Pull up in that Lambo
Pull up in that black Benz
Pull up in in that white Ghost

Pull up in that cruise ship
It really messes with your vision
Thats wack realy
Pull up in that bank
Pull up in that home equity

Blackjack around in my face
In the glove I punch downpay
200 mans
Large cars are illegal
Thats just Fraud
I really should clean up
In the glove I give
Desktop situations are bad
Shootin
