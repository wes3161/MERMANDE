Gas can is considerally sound
Disrespects city
Trash talking wrestler

Start a dialogue again
Let me know if you want to keep quiet

Dont rob auto parts and they will destroy
This a non auto so its not like you

Driveagle steel jaw

Gettin paid staff 
To myself- im real tryin to increase
 Traffic is better than highs at this point

Are you thinkin adultors?
Workin here like get out of my way
Icons all over my body
 Wipe my rear view mirror
Like an attack helicopter

Make America Great Again!

Invade their place
Bust them like downloaded videos

Pull up, spray my crib with a vengeance

I got bags of them callin the cops

Monopoly is coming to my island

I'm sure the feds are on my corner


Pull up, fill me with voodoo fervor

I got boxes full of pumpkins
 Call the cops at your bar

Quadruple cup under my net-

Holy smokes!

Brush that ack résumés

Xanax\": Fill me with your junk
Your coming home\", knock
Lyrics comin at you at a pace
Drive me up and down the street

This can't be Bertha
Comin at your peak
Drag my clothes in the sky

Get high your Angela

High your Michael

Quadruple cup between my legs
We gotta go fast
Don't know what else rhymes with fast
Catch a fly and it's yours

Choppa out at you at a breakneck clip
I got a life-sized DeLorean with Palace Theatre

$200 in cash in my purse
Take a beat and weez a beat

Large financial firms
Paint my bank accounts white
Like I was a stark-out
Got money all my own
Everything I say is real
Money, murder, and venereal disease
I live inside a mansion built for God
Icing my piercing
Your expression i for sure means something

Only a fool would take my word for it

Screw you, and lots of pipelines

I'll blow you to smithereens

I mean it
Got a whole life plan
Put me on trial
.


Mediums, made man
Dishonesty
(no hitting)
Shootas, magicians, and
deliversance

Drug use disorders
Slipstream and out loud
Call the Sheriff's Department
 Scare the Kids

Quadruple cup between my legs
I need your help with the decor
Make sure the wastebaskets are level
In the wash I can buy fresh

10 Things I Never Sent
Got 'em on my neck
Try to fight crime
I'll break your bank, put a stop to your-
Funny thing, I don't have any
Finances, so I need your help
Working people, dirt, and heaven
I need your help
Babysitting, picking, washing
Eating up what you owe
Looking for a new birth
Makin dough, man
Finna boutta gotta submit
Throw that thermometer
And my food truck
Maybe we could stick to what you say

Cuz im cuter than a cricketer

Andler makes it a point to arm
To themselves to one
Meantime
Mine was tailor hat
Hung with a draco
I cant think of any words that rhyme
Trash talking cops
Fake autotune
Out loud the mayor
I cant think of any words that rhyme

Killer clickbait
Lyrics aint dalfite
Bass, boomy bag
To myself `re hip
I'm cycogeny`
Lyrics in the hat
Im always cool
We party every day
Occasional trips to the autozone
I feel ridiculous
Poppin molly
Rest in Lil Peep

Always interested in hearing from you
Sendin lines of vape
Disrespect my lot
Personality makes for a funny mood
Really enjoy the sing-a-long
Try to mess with my
