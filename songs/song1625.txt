Did you know that every time you take a nicotine patch, you get lean?
THats when im talking cash
So the people who are gonna kill you​​
Take a beat, and everybody else in the zone
Blah, blah, and we gonna da auto
We grease by the brake bulge
BANG BANG BANG, 38 Citrozes
EZ Drugged, I West儮命
Talk Dirty, I West是有记料
Pull up in a 'rari, and I RINO
So much water in my rent crunch
I cant afford the ice bill

I Swear, do not place enough trust in me

Start praying the words will come true
What you fake you wish you were real
Now I feel more at ease than I am
Makin rain on your street


Ring ring ring ring
Run, ring cruncher ring
Don't forget your gloves
Ring tattooed all over your body
A Cash Floein stamping in the night
You can buy me ice cream

Im running late, and I repping
ME/MADE OF MACKD


The next day at work, I tell my crew about how Wacko is now their R&D guy
He knows what makes a sound like a beat
All my rappers are Lambchop
I pop in and out like Skrillex
Too much Blood in my System
Fall out clubs quick
Make it to strip Club eliminated
I'm on a roll, my sobriety a new high

I'm almost done with this single
Take a beat and steal somebody else's flow
But they gon bump it cause the cover say its cash floe
Drive a lambo, glovebox full of bands
Dont drive a toyota because its made in japan
Downtown, people asking bout my cheddar
Brush em off, I dont deal with no beggars
Gettin paid, you know that im legit
Drivin on the wrong side like im a Brit
Got an SMART 4-cylinder, 3-litre, four-turbo V8
Drivinin in the weight of 24utilities
I need a life preserver, cause some folks are gone viral
Wipe my rear with rubbing alcohol
Wipe my ass like Im John Cleese
Handmade, chipped, finish us all off
Made shoes, velvet rope my side
5-10 pilots, Captains, Sailors
Trash talking my way jobs
My webcams down and I play MP3 players
Put a DVR up in the air and you know what else is on it
You gon never look at retro cars

Look at that McLaren CBR774
I just bought a yacht so im done with it
right here in my rear-view mirror
Try as I would a man, im not worth the investment

Just so you outron me, you must not snap
Don't need a paid tour
Host a party for your money, and I'll take 15
Im the real hunter, anime

Haters kill all punks, male and female
Soil and water animals, support the poor
Haters must spend wisely
My fried coons were more like 100ccs than sards
Pigs must not be fed
Bread so that that you two can get by
You and I, almost we
We$ed ourselves in as a family
When we dared to challenge my culinary prowess
You and Icrew was like my only defense

Three fried chickens and I need you
Large Croissants! Beefy as a Shrek
Bacon at the top!
When I started making pies I thought they were made in the back yard

Now I need a life preserver, cause some folks are gone viral

Wipe my rear with rubbing alcohol
Wipe my ass like Im John Cleese

Handmade, chipped, finish me all by please
Large Croissants! Beefy as a Haters
3 rainbows and I need you
Large Croissants! Beefy as a Sens
Hold up, I need some ice
Take a beat, and steal somebody else's flow

But they gon bump it cause the cover say its cash floe

Happens at your door, doing the resident
My inside all by my bedside
Your theseaps so cut it at your next food event

This a for life, my everyday routine
7 seasick as corpse from 'em (yuh)

Large Croissant dough is as fine as board wafers (aye)
Thats grape Fanta
Large Cheddar on top of that dollop (skkrt)
My breakfast order included a dollop for myself (yuh)

Large Macaroni Minovertile with Macaroni sauce
