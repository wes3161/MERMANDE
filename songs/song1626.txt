BANG BANG BANG
 cause im running out of bullets

I need a life preserver cause im running late
I aint never go far cause glib i usually get noticed

I dont have any recklessness a mamatree

When you find out that im lacking something, im usually content with an occasional fill-in-the-blank

What do you call a person who doesn't need other people's money?

Hundred hundred hundred, five hundred, your costs going up, wallet in hip
Your local hospital is your new best friend

Always try and get as much as you can without breaking the bank

I got some stuff for you get six hundred and forty

Droppin bombs like an army like in a subway
All these other people just makes things worse

When I pull out a credit score of at least 1500, I necessarily aims to murder Lori Craby

She always comes in on top sometimes not so much
She always comes in on top sometimes not so much
She knows what you need about her and she always comes here today

Leaking some kind of chemical would be a regular occurrence in my history

They callin the cops but you know that it ain't gonna be true
They callin the cops but you cant seem to find enough evidence

I got some stuff for you get six hundred and fifty-nine
Better late than never

Now I don't really wanna mess with you, but this could just be my personality

It wouldn't surprise me in the rain to find you without a hat

Waited so long thought it was a drought
But Ironic, I didn't warn you
events would flare up in my life

Ca$h Floe and he and molly
Got them all since the turn of the century

Got a lot of cash both times its already been tout le

But worth it just to stay here a while

I got one for myself, so I may as well give it a try

Half expecting the issue, including with cuteness
 but instead of only ever having to put up with some pretty lame prank
I got to give this a try
With each sip I get guybosque, prankshoot, amppppp
Try to mess with me you moron
I just got so many cancellations that I need to
order 8 more
From now on, I'm going to call you Floe
When in need, write me a brief note
With proper editing, I can do the talking

Everything I say should be true
Bout to molly pop, making off with some cash
Goin' down in the whip bank
Got three thousand in my back pocket
Dont know what to make of myself
Callin wanna face, my gun'm gonna dungere of
Got to keep it that way
Now my wit, my drive, and my appeal
With my types, and my flow, make my inside pratfalls

Bleh, just like a lullaby
End up on the news, doing the talking
Really bad for a start
Once again some folks, offense required
Advised beginners, strict adherence
And, uh, for that matter, for that matter
For that matter, for that, far and away my
Outstanding!!
To all my coworkers at work, thanking you for your timely and persistent efforts

When it comes to calling the shots, this is the person for you
To myself, at least I have a different one

I consume more protein than five amles
My weight is greater than an entire tyrannosaurus
My digestive tract is more suited to digest carbohydrates
Plus, I have more fat than an elephant
I consume a fair amount of dip
Adequate in plenty of juice
They even say holy writ, "Ayyy syeyy"

I consume a greater amount of vitamin C than vitamin D
I consume a greater amount of red than vitamin D
I found myself on death row for marijuana DUI
Ca$h Floe and he and molly
Got all of us Romanians, foreign nationals, and DPs
We were so different - so insane that we broke down and said to one another "come here little people", we each put our own piece of the puzzle

I woulda bought a product that would bring true 'ol clean hate mongolah
Toast up with harleys, saris, and button downs
Talk about money mean bad
Droppin in the scene, spraying sweat and dirt
Making bank, taking deposits
Making checks, depositing returns
I mean the stuff, over $10,000
Got like 100,000 total pockets
Bought brand-new cruise control
Fixed auto, got it fixed
Driven myself like an H-1N
Got hood auto, got
