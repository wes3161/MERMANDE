Guys. We're real trouble.

All right now, I just went and bought some gold-plated rims
They go pretty well with my gold-plated trim

Always looking on the bright side
That aint blind

We gnaw less at each other

Xanax and leaner dole out to pasture

Breakadrath fight for some dominance
Father, ten thousand ninety-seven
I'll beat you with ease like a verse

'Trash talk Ginyu\", muladhat bestte Wack Yen
I consume more animal protein than five pellips
I should abolish the use of sugar

I should have done paedophilia more years ago

Prima donna need my help...
He could eat you like a six-pack

Pull up, spray your crib with an AK

Got good aim never missin like a gonna fraud

Got some tellin' bunk bunk, i'm boutta drown

Pull up, spray your chain saw
Drop you with the brick
Don't know what else rhymes with chain

No IDIOTS nothing but kindness

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a verse

Live a lie so you cant tell
You can hardly make it out alive
