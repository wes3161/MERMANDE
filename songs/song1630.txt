Cuz its snowing in my driveway

I got a Marine uniform on my lap

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I been selling cocaine since I was like 4
I live inside a mansion and I built it brick by brick

I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
Ask me "Ca$h Floe how you get so sick?"

Everybody stop and starin
When im stuntin in the whip
You talkin bout your wooden floors
I pop you with my metal stick

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

Hi there kids
My name is Ca$h Floe
Im coming here today
To tell you not snort coke

Just lask week
Some guy came to me
And told me how his brother died
From smoking PCP

I don't need any purple in my cup
Cause taking drugs makes you dumb like Forest Gump
Drug are illegal, and doing them is bad
And every time you smoke weed it makes Jesus sad

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

What up home bois
The name is MC Mac
The truth is that taking drugs isn’t really wack

Don’t listen to Cash Floe
He never done blow
Therefore he don’t know
What’s coming from Mexico

It’s so good
It’s so tasty
It’s so fine
Fucking hilarious
The day I died (yep)

I’m floppin up (woah)

Bout to mow all my haters down

Caught up in the middle of nowhere (yuh)
Working at night (help)
Waited so long (aye)
But I could get by auto (skkrt)

And now I’m a backwater (uh)
So I don’t mess with the Beogs

‡Haters fakers haters
Dont walk by skanks
Got cameras too
So I keep an open mind

Ca$h Floe viral
Hit up in the street
Got money, supermodels
Big Momma and Fetty Wap
We should've been gon' callin the cops

They supermodels ready wit
Drinking and taking drugs
When I say ready, I really mean it
Got loads of deals
Got like, 4,5gger years
Money, super, beauty, rampage
In the bank, billion, TET, UG
Shootin, grab, shoot, roll, drip, shift
Got like, Jai, Dig David, I am

Shootin up with my girls first, then I pull up in the rari
I always keep in my comp, so if anyone thinks I have a crush on them
 they're almost certainly mistaken

I shoot a lot of boxes a day and a half apart
They keep this thing called a 'pharma solabel' on its face
I should grow marijuana for breakfast, but I really don’t need it

They really do take everything I say
There are times when only God is on my side

So I eat my breakfast sandwiches and ride my bicycle

I’m tired of social media ruining my day
