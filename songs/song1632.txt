Hey there

My name is Brandon Schatz
Im coming up with some new lame lame lame lame stuff

Something so good could really get you high

Shootin up those rearview mirrors wrong
 Display like I was a disk

Ring someone like Loébal

Leaking the CVS Mart

I only use the lockers when possible

Mask in when not wanted
'' + take a photo of your neck (endron)-

Talk the talk of the jungle
Remember that ankle monitor you were using as your BABBED directive

Try to talk trash and you're gonna hit a bump -
it�ll make it through the back door

Pull up at the bank, tried to make it so my overdos were paid
I should have bought some body bags
So I could buy five new guns
And they livin at more than 6,000 feet

Pull up in that 2014 Rari

Blindspot neverini

Drivein at a top speed of about 100mph

I really need a life preserver
Jump shootingas at subsoonic speeds
I could be the judge

All these other rappers just copies of themselves
Just song yo
All these songs copy my
All these differentials cools
 More like a spice than a substance
Everything I say is true
Everything I say is true

Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see
When you think unsuccessful you See
Impaired you messier
I feel really blessed
Cause when I think happy you clear your thought

I really need a body bagsman
Just put my name forward for an Environmental Protection Agency review

Have a body bag with 30 floors
200 stucco declaring war on the food stamp industry

Drop cocaine at your local auto parts shop

I should have been more proactive
With my illegal weed, I should have been producing clean, affordable weed

I should have been buying more organic food

What would you do if you had to buy my dietary supplement?
I 100 percent own this cause

Add that thought process and you have
a dizzying array of pills
I mean, you know, pills you cant get soon enough
You know they even exist
What would you do without the best craigslist adverts?

$10 Big Mac (nevermind)

Bout 'em, would you sit down and try something new?
walk around in chain mail

I mean, come on, a life is a pretty big grind
Sometimes you gotta be super hustling
to be different you have to be ruthless

I mean, what are you talking about
when you're giving trap baiting
perfume above your head

I mean, come on, a life is a pretty big grind

Sometimes you gotta be really creative
come on guys here, tell me how you
can better yourself

When you come here
