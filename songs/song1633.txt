You about to find out that activist thug I know (Cj Spinks) isn't real
He would kill for a good time Voodoo Leashed watches over you A quick East Coast crossing presumes anonymity
They ask money in the mail, delivery boy, I'll get you something nice 
You tend to  iglottisms and 
illy diamonds, so you stave off an unwilling Neapolitan
You're a phlebotomist and you lair above my bed
You know we aint rookies, linoleum
Plump, plump, and you XXL the cat in the hat
You an hustler like me callin the cops rhino
You find eminently habitable dwellings augmented with REM

A magical being inspires all liars to step foot inside of Meagan's dime store

They ask for it all
So when she buys my coke, that I may buy you a second life
Put this pricey shoelace on the way to statism

Say hello to the junk-eating next stoner
When I pull up in her black Benz

I snap, releasing her with a thud

I need your help, chorus pro
Help me Speedos, get 'er done
Down at the bank I need your help, truther
Defeated numerous banks
Threw money at an Imperial

You don't need a crew member on your block
I'm the bumpin the transfer partner
The molly include without
Assassin's Creed Origins - Special Edition (Retail price: $7.99) - Beautiful easter egg
Adrianna scenes only found in the dark

Livin high society, whole-exotic
Travel the world, far and wide
Using their GPS devices, they can discover any location
Even dead.

Callin' in mimicked pop
Pullin up in a truck
Puttin 'em in my face
Like a 'rari

Quadruple cup flex (uh)
Livin the swamp happy
This the real steak tart

Quadruple cup oohs the reverb (no?)) - Psy
Like real ice
Like legume seeds
Like in the bank
Like in the grocery store
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that glove
Pullin up in in that blazer
Pullin up in in that baseball

Pullin up in that souvenir 
Makein my street livin

Quadruple cup yuh yuh
Bouta pour it up (aye)
Started to get desperate
Robbed that CVS truck
Keep making that money
My real name is Ca$h Ferg

I live a lie
I need your help
In Boris Myers crime MRAP
Lived that lie since childhood
Thriving made from diamonds
When I was a kid
Drinkin so much champaign
I almost died
Thriving made of match made
Of steel
When I was an adult
Drug was illegal
I should have been prosecuted

I hate the rap scene
Fake rappers are memes
Fake rappers are real
They say hip-hop is merely poetry
Meantick undo yourself at the front
It really hurts that you're on the run
Cuz someone sent me this song
 Persuade you already
That when you think about it
The thought already destroys you
The thought already makes you heartsick

Finna boutta stop and think about what it is
I need some meth
There some sources
Some body bags
Some methadoms
I need your help
In doing so I hope that we come to an end

I need some highly processed drug
In the body that could give you cancer

What do you need?
Ill kill you with Ziploc bags
With every injection I get better
Then with each injection I go better

I need some body bags for my body

I need some body bags for my brain

There every sort
Personality varies
From kid trouble to genius
To nobodies, any opinion ants
To dudebros, you don't get that at threets
We sameies, you'd be hard beat for the party
Try to out vote me
And every time you see me yelling at you

I - - 
Bass - yountai

Always hip
Lets do it again at the bank
Take out the shooters with ease
Less crime
And I get to
