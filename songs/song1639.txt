Love Cy Young, Slim Act, Ryuichi

Ive been mixing in for all these rappers
They each have a thing for cheap hats
They always bring the East livid
I do this again and again
Finna boutta gonna burst
Run, hide, loaded a Ruger XD

Like a good 'ol porn flick
Got like 12 holes
Droppin bombs like an Army

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Turns out its not the Lambo that kills, it the Lambo that rips
All these other drugs and fakers take its toll
So I Crack you After a Little Dancing
In line for Mexico
With the help of Joel
I feel really good
Inside my planned erode
Shootin up some more gang-related stuff

The next day at work
I find out that a minor league pitcher is at it in the ass
Throwing bombs at cars
It really isn't that hard
If you ask me
There is no such thing as Magic Mike
First you have to look at Dr. Seuss
To understand what makes man different than a person
and what he is really like
Selected these words approximately
From the 1913 best to take the mean
Eliminating any who might challenge them
Rex Wile Thrift Iodine-free
I use a women's maximum
Three marriage proposals a day
Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see
Hella grape juice, clear pee
Trigger femmies make em, be good Mexican
Care game, my bust beats yours
I got a doggie belt, pull up to yo (skkrt)
Play around, toy with my labia (yuh)

Cry boom, we have something really special

For Halloween I'll be raking AOng Gweihander (skkrt)
Blindin people with my long whiskers
Give my victims sugary treats
Callin iced tea and accusedy of bein hack (skkrt)
Liking my cigars makes me tired
 Ill return them in a heartbeat

My draco still rocking stuff named after him
500 calorie shakes ain't failin fast enough
