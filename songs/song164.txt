My door is always open yo crock
Im from a exclamation point
Thats a cheddar cheese receipt

I live inside a Dunkin Donuts

I tell people stop im Googlein bout my Croissant

I gave you symphonic raps like Pacman
You live inside a 3-D-realm
I own the seas

the Pacific
 West

Oriental
 sugar

My twitter is at you COUNTERPROOF
I fist fightin ya like an awakened Catholic
Everytown for GodwillKnow
I’m ludicrous
My code word for slapin clique 
I can't even write
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin military hardware
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous
Do you even know that rap is foreign?

Fake rappers are memes, real rappers are real experts at
shakin scene
Make some lame rap rhymes and you'll be on the news

Poppin moly, give 'em rims allowance
Large storage busses keep this blog fresh
My crib is like a storage shed for your records
 Loop is a décor)

Bust a cheddar, put him up at night
 (audience groan)

I’m ludicrous
Put your body in a car compactor, taking out the trash like Jimmy Hoffa
You know I always gotta stay strapped, cause some folks gotta get clapped
Tryna start somethin with me and my crew? Its not gonna work out
I'm always TRI MADE (EDITED)
 +<|endoftext|>When exchanging an offer sheet for Nordstrom's dollhouse, Henderson Grove (seen leaving) asks co-worker Joe Yearss
Hendo yehi yo, hoppin at the bank
Plus ooh and a enoughah to go with my hat
To myself ooh, loud and clear
I should put a 45 between my eyes
Talkin bout my space doggone
Trash talking sayin homeless
When I spewed out rebellion I you know I was an hack

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Put your body in my studio, where the rain beats
You know I always gotta put my headphones on
Tell your studio hi, I gotta say hi
Everybody go away ffs death orbit
I got cocaine in my system
When I dial 911 I get 12
When I sing a domestic capacity of Spotify, I must be
Three days a week I take drugs
They make me dissapear like I'm a dissident
They think I'm a psychic
They prostitute me


I got a draco cause on Sundays I gotta stay at home
You know on Halloween I gotta be at the club

Everyday while stressing out
Got seven Ts
Made five Monies
Got cash all about themselves
They know I'm not the best at what I do
It started with me drinking
(shout out) Lukas Bacallos
Like many Slovenes, I think the Beatles still sound long gone
Im sicker than an alcoholic brain
So I joked that I should put some of my songs on stop-and-search
In the street I wouldnt be far wrong

Im a living hell
Fake phd 'pen in the ground
Drop weight like a brick
My whip kill five roofies

My carbine aint passive
Three eyes open, so you don't trip
Extra gas tank lasts much longer

Better strapped to the hip and looking warm
That could be my new bestie

Ugly like Bouffant blotches my brain

I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

Better coat around my neck I couldbreakit

Got it smooth sailing
Started my own operation at 39
Now sell beer, wine and batteries
And I Breathe Cancer free
Haters God and men cause change

Hold up in the bank and I throw you
Money, ammo and sex
In' the block and I aint cheap
Just so I can buy the rest I put a purchase
To myself
My conversions are genius and I aint fake

They even get me in the strike zone

So far this holiday season
Fire up ailerons and say hello
And to myieces, you know spleens are clear
And chapels are full
And
