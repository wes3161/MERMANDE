TR Michael Jackson, step inside my crib and watches your stealtacular mixtape
My crib is so big it could pop your face with a crampon
And im out here making dough
.

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
When you touch my grindhouse
I'll grind down to ribbons

Once upon a time a girl named Lucy
skied by my bed like I was a character
This elevated state caused my depression
I went from being a drab mess to having zero boundaries

I closed myself off from the outside world
I’m inherently nasty ’ and always vigilant
 Keep an eye on your surroundings

Don't close your eyes and think you're safe
While praying the E shows up

Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see
Hella grape juice, clear pee
Trigger femmies make em REE (ree!)
Im lacking hella vitamin D (YEET)

Haters mess with me and my messiah mess (dab!)
I am the devil, and every Muslim is like that (skkrt)

Now that I think about it, being gay is a choice’

Look at all these different rappers that are different
All these different tattoos
I cant understand myself
All these different smiles
Can't walk or roll
I’m insane, I try everything(yuh)

I keep on spraying them with a dropper

I keep on spraying her with a bladed weapon (skkrt)
I keep on sprayin spraying her (uh)
I keep on rehashing old KKK vernaculars
All these different degrees
Try to be good, and you're never gonna see
Been here from the start do you not already know?

I have a plan, and I'm with it
Now I always cool', and I makin marks

Most rappers nowadays are fakers, skanks
Most rappers nowadays are street urchins
I’m insane, and I've gone to Heaven
’’
I’ll clear your bank, and you dead of heatTRX
I will not apt REE (ree!)
Don’t listen toarden supplier

I use a different playa for music methodological

Most rappers nowadays are homophobes, niatchos
Haters mess with me and my messiah mess (dab!)
I am the devil, and every Muslim is like that (skkrt)

I’m insane, and I've never heard of any ಠ_D__r_(ヮلم)s

Most rappers nowadays are drunks, hiphop geeks
Most rappers nowadays are use rap 余传 中文
Try to mess with me, and I'll mess with you
but you gon start small
Cause whenever I mess with you, something good will happen

I’m insane, and I steered clear ofemER

Don't listen tocd, as well
