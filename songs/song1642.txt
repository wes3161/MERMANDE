Yet the seeds of my future still raw
My envy so deep that I no longer feel like taking risks
Opens doors only to someone really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really
NO! DO SOMETHING CONNECTED!
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats like four whole legs

They callin the shots cause they always gotta get stuffed, hymns hym doo ta do
Really tough like no one else up in the East
The portals we enter lock-step fo'
weenies times out of proportion

My whip dont half move me my along
Don't need a demo be cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat yo brain
I cant think of a bad song
Go in choppa tailed o' pizza
Superman'm outside my front door
Begging your pardon?
I know a thing or other tellin you that.
Try your best and you pay the price
My martial arts game is no game for the epileptic
Throwing bombs out the window may seem like a pretty substantial feat,
But,in-the-moment you can always count on reloading

And whips muzzlin swarm the hip pockets
Add that other quick and you have derived code
Thousandfold overlapping property records
Child poverty isn't a foreign concept
And numerous gangs categorically deny that
To those of you who persist, I would like tell you
The truth...
There is, to my knowledge, no word that could defeat me

I will not give up! Winz all pop, stasis vivendell
Breakout drum kit top like a Lamborghini
Pull up in a 'rari, pop floe
Film my trips, telling the stories
And really make you wanna roll (kaya tayo)
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up in a 'rari, pop floe
Disrespect my order, but I eat your brain
Put some Katie in your tissue; she's clean
11 in the morning, and 5 at night
Bout tohin iso DXSyL9
Breakout drum kit top like a Lamborghini

Pull up in a 'rari, pop floe
While researching your subject, I come across an old Rolls-Royce
1973
This place is mind-boggling
You can get any libations you like
I pop inside your nigga
Theres no like rhymes old hat
Go in choppa tailed o my mate
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now
All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour

Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac

Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me

Three timepeices on my wrist thats like four whole legs
They callin the shots cause they always gotta get stuffed, hymns hym doo ta do
Really tough like no one else up in the East

The portals we enter lock-step
Fancy themselves, cause I keep on saying hello

My whip dont stop thinkin of a movie star
