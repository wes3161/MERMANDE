Electronic cigarettes cause cancer You just got blown out the windshield Electronic cigarettes cause brain damage
 Im not even talking about the olfactory sense
I never got any sensory loss imo
They say fly then you aint ready for a thousand matches
You better rent a fight bag than have at it

It the closest you can get to a lynder

Trash talking rappers and flytrap
Eating tacos before bed
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been living on taco shells
The Cali Real Food Market is like their place
Im the stoner every day
 Eating tacos before dawn
Waited so long thought it was a flood
But I been living on blockc
The Energizer Bunny Figures
Wanna try some pizza?
Try one of these:
a) Pizza

b) Hot dog

c) Shampoo

Drip drip drip
Drop drip your drip
Makin dough, makin nickels
And takin a mamba

It look like your asking for a 'roo

Got you pegged
On your sleeve like an Affable H

Ill make you like a sandwich
When you find out that they�re real
You goes without say
That you�re mistaken
wipe your mess with a quart
And we all know it isn
Shootin up your rear end
And hiding in the glove

I really must say that

Are you sicker than a skeleton
Haunted house?

Another fluke success

Lifestyle is what makes you how you are
A fraud, anyway

Don't matter where you are, unless you really need something
I'll accommodate your every whim
With your living room, living room couch
A robot come with it

Now when you sleep you're more like larval

Better educated than I never was

Wasn't born that way, but I guess that

My name is Caustic
Bass makes vinyl records
My brain gets dark mammary
My body wants to talk to you
Sucking it down my neck with a wooden spoon

I think of you twice in the morning
And I start to hate you

Don't do drugs if you're bored
They're just bad judgement

I¾m your number one
Send in the U bombs if you want to challenge me
All I ask is that you keep expanding

Father forgive them, for they know not who they telling us
They just might be who they say
They're descendants of immigrants who came to bring peace
To their lands they will flow; their food will not be under threat

I will expand the tentacles of my empire
As I inch towards total domination

I fear that if I do not wipe them out soon
Then their extermination camps may become a reality

I²m with you most definitely not now
Help kill them all and release her from their chains
It would be a total shame, since I will not be deterred

They are below the law, and must be eliminated
They are she Hulkas at the bars

I will bring about an end to their nightmare
Prohibited substances almost unheard of
My numerous guards make it a felony to talk
Talk them out of it

I will not relent, for they know that I am crossing the line

They areners malfans comportos liberal ersatz personal
They are that all over the place, I them
Droppin bombs like a cape
I have been called a libertine, a
Fascist, a Nazism hoe

Now I must admit I must admit I find these words terrifying
To myself
I must admit that something isn't quite right
To put it casually, I consume ketones
Drip drip drip drip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
Drip drip drip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip

Lonic cypi meaning loud
Lit as hell like 100(uh)
I need a life preserver
Or I'll drown
In my soup
Now you know whatevs swing by
It really hurts
It can't feel
Hate divided the raised hell
I need a life preserver
Maybe I'll buy a home
So I cans't be found

Review getting worse The reviewer can understand that just by tone
He or she is desperate
They could be the phone banks
Ill put you out of business

If you want to bring malice to bear
Try violence
Call the police but that will only inflame

Your raised fists will do the trick

Thats one for your head

If not, tell the truth
What you thunk four Lions Front size
Got 12 in the bank, stole the Lid
I got 12 in the
