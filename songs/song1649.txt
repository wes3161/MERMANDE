Appreciate them a thousandfold

Three strikes three times codeine
Codeine alleviate insomnia

Three pills four times fingran
Three nicotine patches numerous
I get the mood, I go
With a jazzy changing room
And amidst the shuffle dept
I have to lean in to check

Don't do drugs
Imbalance the ground
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup hyper
Droppin bombs like Gaza
Like Diplo and he on a watchlist
Don't do drugs
Imbalance the ground
Pull up in a a 'rari
Quadruple cup bi-weekly
Shootin up like Domhnall and he on a watchlist
Don't do drugs imbalanced on a daily basis

All these other hands my scene is like a dartnet
All these other mansions look like amazon slush
All these other mansions look like private jets
All these other mansions look like mammoth trucks
All these other mansions look like conqueror mongabay
All these other mansions look like japanese street beggars
All these other mansions look like college kids with bags
All these other mansions look like homeless adult hoe
My street name is
