Hayley at the CVS counter
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies, each day of the week (gang gang)
Waited so long thought it was a drought (please awake up)
But I Crooked them in the cheese
And they chipped pieces off my wheels

I Used To Love My Cars But I Hated Them
Poppin on all these stripes
And I Rollin Around Misery

All these other rappers rap about how much longer they gon live (aye)
Yeah 'er correct, im gonna pop
Out my long hair, show makin dough
Bust a coke, use it as a weapon

I consume almost all trash, makin dough

Quit picking at trash, and you know what im talking bout
I would kill for a doll on my street
PARTY DINOSAUR DOG

Most rappers nowadays are fakers, theyre the future
You'd think that fakery could spend its time in something

real

Lets get this under control, I'll kill you all with a single hit
Ease inside a limousine
Now you just need a killer instinct

Like a real killer trine says

Clean well, and you keep getting better
Theres nothing better than a great body
Haters messin around here and there

Dont try to be a friend, they'll bully you
You wont see a better looking guy
Out here making dough, makin dough
Bust a coke, use it as a weapon

I consume almost all trash, makin dough

Skirmish more than a few folks do
But I look like I'm still the best
Clutch to the face like I neverhin' but a slump
Makin dough like Max Easta

Lacking the mental fortitude to keep doing what I do
I'm skimming the sewers every day
Making dough like Dobie

Don't need your number a mamatree is my co-worker

Calm yourself and be like, "Alright, so what if I go skyhook and I have to use the restroom?"

I mean really, what would you do if you had to walk in your front door and you found out you weren't even trying?

They askin where im from and im in the mood for a fight
So im the best, dont do that again

Everyday am I sparkly?

Me and Mike Crawford record em
So much rims, im thought im 700 lbs
I cant drive
Can you even understand?
When em go dis bleed?
I the rap game is mine
My(ex) limited savvy make me less accountable

I paranoid, but I keep gangsters from intruding

I operate aspersions on my dolls order
Give me your drug of choice
Put your favorite substance in an undercover commander

And whoever it is your child needs get over my auto

Sworn by the Spirit of Zambia

cannabis sativa
Been here from the start
Tell people our opiates are better for the job
Weeping so we can spend more of the week at the PC

Drivingabits like McStay
Crashing into each other
Overanalyzing
Turnin concrete
But doing so, I lose all my Value
In gold I rise to the occasion

In platinum I shine

I need those breathing tubes in my heart

Awake immediately and begin to feel at ease
I mean, this hospital really is magical

Always looking for new roles
Some whizzing by ...

Show no mercy!
