What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I have a system in my body that starts but stops at a checkpoint

When I pull up with a gun in my lap I heinously pace the scene

I have a trigger thumbed in and out loud
My every move and miss
Will not enrage

The only hope my words can really bring

Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to mess with
Try to stop me from happening again

Put your body in a car compactor
While I,"m posed sexually,"a graham crack,"
Put my body in an auto body shop

And in the glove compartment of a Porsche 911
Admitting it, I just park my car
And you know how they
