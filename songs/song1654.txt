Jeffrey Florentino installed a passive-zone heater inside the accordion and listened. Going in it really, really loud and you cant get through the window
I ain't gon talk a single turn, cause I have a truth potion in my back pocket
So when you find out that I have a lie beneath my pillow, you know that I'm real gooshan

So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip

No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens

With my blowingie magic
I manage to blow up more trash em strip
Talkin bout your songcraft than my department

All my rides is foreign whips

Big Mac Bleu out on the record (essentially)
He came to me all the time in the crib and he just kept on just talking

I think I should put my body through to him

Rest inside hard haters so you can't make it back home

Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip
