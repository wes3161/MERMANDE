There is a ubiquitous disease called unipolar disorder that's being blamed for its numerous facets including its success rate (only 6% to 20%);

Do you know that half the ice-cream chain employees in the United States are junkies?

Some day I'll wipe the whole board-H off my back

Large corporations are really just big-ass rent hogs that keep us allÂ  out on the street

While walking by a nearby plantation
