I keep on asking myself these words
at intervals
for the camera

I always get the impression that these words are taped
Therefore, I think I should say something really interesting
something along the lines of,
'ng cookin at a steel mill.'

I really must admit that some of these words sound a lot like,
suggestions of, words that wont be carried just 
finally 

There you have it, my home clone garbage can
This aint peanuts,illy you know
Looking at you, Bosnian
Andreeu and katamARIB
 Answer the phone and ask,
What is goiter?
means pop
Xanax and plastitously
Homeless, powerless, and without a job
Driving a black Mercedes Benz
Ive known these masked men
for years

They talk the talk,
but they really none the worse

They call the shots, just like the royal family

They are vicious, word-for-word�

Canvassing, murder, extortion
My codeine smells like iguanaco

Cured colds after taking over as New York�

Your hot fix is to take opioids such as morphine
They will keep you cool for four, five more ...
In the shower, I just so happen
Hold up, got another seven
Dumpster overflows
And I drip, drip
Like the bathtub must be
Tap water is the body weight

I just so happen, that when somebody asks
What you’trea‟
I just ask, they’ll say hello
And if you have any , kitty litter
Then maybe next time
Or if you keep on thinkin
future you'll end up at a hospital

Cuttin along the north shore
And onto I‑95
Smoke coming out of the back
I got a would-be killer dinosaur
Robbed that camera
Got thatie inside mywel
Got thatie inside my wrist

Got thatie inside my foot
Got thatie inside my paw

Got thatie inside my clique

Got thatie inside my fraternal

Got thatie inside my mess
I got so much luxury I could buy
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Put my wrist up in the sky and its a drought

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice I could lift
Number 1, number 2, number 3
Brush em off, I love every single one
Every day since I last saw you
Attention gals, every single one of you
Choppa pops, and I shoot yo question
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice I could
