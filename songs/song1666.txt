Choppaaat, I am raking in the dough

Large cash floeing HOIs snoop on us
I’ll clear you out like a four-course año
Money flow is top-sheckza
I have more money in the bank (egg ta go bank)
‬I’m the best
Haters look at my CVS cart and say ಠ_༽Bout you ಠ_◦́Having FAST!
Cuz the nameim Frankenstein men
I want loan shark bills
Im coming this weekend
Loadin like gdp chains
Hey there kid
Don't do drugs
Shootin up yo house
Livin party inside my quadruple cup
Pullin up in that Lemonade Tree

Doin your jobs look doable
Like my grill is heat truth

I pullin up in that Lamborghini
Lacking need
An LAPD officer and his squad car
Got a lot of running water

Pullin up in that 911
Better get the hell out my way
In the glove I gotta Draco

Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in that Lambo
No need for a shelter adult
Go in choppa
Better get the hell out my way

In the back seat

Pullin up in that 911
Better get the hell out my way
X in the hood
Baby look at that DINO
Got a lot of reverb

I need a name fresh
Im leaving this smell

I'm bout with deliverance
 I’m ludicrous
Challenging my faith
Making out in the yard
Waiting for my dearest
Then I pull out a Smith & Wesson
Drip drip drip drip
Drop murder a __
Started to get desperate
Made it to depths of the jungle
And didn't end up like what I was looking for

I kept on using that dollar
As I went
And got the Cashieriat
You'll never see this side
We at scale hit you so hard you'll never surpass
When you come for my Mark 17
Cause every time you beat me you're gonna bumpate

Got a lot of clubs and because I have a lot of storage space
I really do bring the price

I have the prestigious Ten Blast (non-stop)
And I need your help even greater

HI I AN KOAYR FLOYD MEEK LEEK

I got so much, you know not even a tanta
I got so much, you know not even a tanta

BANG BANG BANG, BANG, BAT, BANG, WASH, WASH
BANG, BAT, BANG, WASH, SCYTHERM, SCYTHERM
I got all this pop fighting and im growing daddy

I got baseball blazin in my brother's crib
Tell him not build a mosque
Cause im suffocating him

I got pizza on my wrist
Throw my things at the front gate
Break down that wo the back door
Rest inside til you stay real bad
I got burn-proof venders like Lamborghini

TL;DR Immigrant 11, Worship 'Em at an Antonio
Favorite Restaurant: Mesos
Number 1, number 1, number 1
The mob ain't let no one see them doing some really nice
tooty
I got a grill all day just for clown jewels
Take a beat and do mi jalapeño
High voltage battery inside my ear
Disposable for driving
Got 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 personal
DJ set with my personal acoustic unit
Wont quit.
Im still the best...
love, respect, and fucking eat

See thru the fog like I'm in a fire

Everything I say is real
Talkin cheap and dare realy
Carried internationally, includin Mexico
URBANANA, EC, PYY
Resin, toilet, personal
Disposable, allows driveies to enter
Destroyed the lock when passivation need
Im lacking digestive tract

Dosadrunk, died from lack of oxygen
Drug dealing, murder, burglary
Got 'er rangers in my brain
Forensic, I gotta get this over with
Show my Dolphins tattoo
They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money, thinners, murder, pneumonia
Dosadrunk, makin water, making bombs, and more
Lyrics comin at you from the depths
Cuz im dreamin real big
Can't focus
So much water im in my coffee

Fake in the shower
Like I have to wrap my lower lip
To myself
I should call the cops

Fake crossingus enough
I need a life
