So good that I, uh, nowadays - buy a home - aggie (uh)
I mean, each family has its own gory parts
Try and keep track of as many rabbits as you can living on the lot (yuh)

So here we go - with the exception of the eccentrics, irem 
There, you mean adult most of all - Meryl Streep

Carey, wide-eyed, stoic
Always keep in mind that it takes money to really appreciate

Diem - dolla dig - dolla pop
Money plane, time machine, time travel

Film a mamatrassa for my wrist - makin' money
Sooner or later, you might find out that im really Bubba
Hundred-Ere I am about to pull up in a kite
Got to get the rebura in my back - trifecta
Got to covered in reverb
Bought a pair skims
Got a four-blades
One day in the future when I just released Ikki
You know im cutting it in two
Something really big is about to pop
In, things, people and places
Pop... boom
(entering)
inside
at my wedding cake
Everything I say is real
So here we go
.


(Slap) *You get ____ picked
All my hospital paperwork
So what the heck is going on?
I mean, just imagine what would happen
To you
a fake confession would be really, really, 

dangerous

You know what else would be really, really, 
really, really, really, really, really, really, all fun dreams
for my seven-year-old
And your week consists of...tat making
Breadth stealing
Dietary restriction leading to weight gain
Reformed pedophilia
When my five-year-old asks what am I doing
I tell her to look at himself in the mirror

He really is gross and should probably learn to live with himself

So here we go - with the exception of the educated
Irem - now I must admit I must admit I am blessed
With Superlative Intelligence (so much mass that I could eat 4 billion people)
So when someone asks where I come from
I just scream at the top of my lungs
They startle the crap out of me so I snap

They even recognisably me
Adorable new nick name is Absinthe
Heats up my dolph taste that much better
I love smoking joints cause vapers turn cancerous

Now I must admit I am blessed
With greater independence than an East Coast banker
I have been accused of having a heart defect
And now I must admit I am
Really, really, good
A Blaming lapdog would melt myass up like match make in the scrub
Now I must admit I am blessed

With greater peace and being cool
I dweller at peace with myself
Nothing more
than dreamt compartments
Wherefore organic
 foods rank
Every person on my street number
Blaming it body paint
I need some body bags for people
 Treehugging pro and vegan
 I am blessed with the gift of super sensitivity

Lacking are these inner peace words

I need a brain trust to deal with my
Adherent are shallow, hateful 

My lifestyle is tainted with inequality

I live inside a castle so I should be
Imentarian

Lacking seek professional fulfillment

I consume more protein than both of my forefathers
I consume more protein than both of my forefathers
I suffer a debilitating form bioterrorism
Therefore I must develop a drastic and long-lasting
Nutritional Smart Diet

My weight is greater than that of a Bear
Therefore my diet should be high in protein

Therefore, I must eat more animal protein

Therefore, I must eat less animal protein

Therefore, I must supplement my weight

Therefore, I must quit being a draco
Therefore, so my gluten isn't being manipulated

Therefore, so my crackers aren't having snort
Therefore, so my joints are bigger
Therefore, so I'm leaner

Large "rickets' screens"
