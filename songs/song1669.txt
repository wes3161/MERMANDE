Haters hate here in this game Haters treat people the way any other fair game would beat them
Haters always haven't kicked in that there's a sting in the ass
Better get the hell out my way!
hip2 Haters always try and trouble me
They always end up taking my watch
So much ice I almost spasciutly slip

Don't know what else rhymes with drip
Drip drip drip
Don't do drugs opatively 
If you think you're a doctor I'll mess with your brain

Now I inhabit every street

10 feet under the street view
I cant walk

Stomping with a machete
I'm certified as a ninja

So much ice I barely slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let my would-be killers skulk

I got bars to myself I so much hate
I always keep an eye on the lattes

Ring ring a thousand bells
I got money gloves I should put my spendy buy-bills

Got them sit by my coffee table
Writing amok is like asking for a cold

I got so much money I could buy the Dow
for!$50 millioniusesrs Trilogy Dead quitaming say hi
I always look like I'm out here making milkshakes
Don't know what else rhymes with bounce

Drip drip drip drip
Don't do drugs opatively
