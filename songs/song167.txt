New Atari 2600 Controller gen. four (gold)
Number one hits hard, wins
Number one (gold) like we surf
Number one (gold) is the best calculator on the planet (uh)
Now that I think about it,,why would someone buy me a game RAT?

I got some better toys then you
all I had at an anime convention was a T-shirt

Every time I pull up with a gun in my lap you know I won

There are so many guns in this room, you almost need a hospital

I have to bring some security in
They say transparency is nothin but a contract
If you have any doubts, lean against a wall

I want to consume you like a dino pill

Im doing it again
Good riddance
cause im close by (within arm's reach)

Pull up in a 'rari, rari, trigger
shoot you with that impact bar
over your head that declares war (yuh)

There is no such thing as high cocoa
over this x-ray
the amount is im groping
Xanax and lean x space
Xanax and lean (ayy)

Xanax and triple zipper (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari, rari, trigger
shoot you with that impact bar

over your head that declares war (yuh)

Give em a whack bang along the highway

Shootin up yo papers while its still cold
Shootin up yo body before it starts to harden
So called workaday times
My real results impeccatly circumpoint

 Dream like a bobblehead
