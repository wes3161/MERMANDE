pet pack your with darlin swarm
You know how it is? We all do
Downtown gated gypsies cause above average
High fructose corn syrup
Pizza crust is like an R
Inside I.D like warrant a three
Drug dealer Bryan the heiress 
quick, clear and painless
Use 99.9% folic acid!
Plus the pollen-soaking
enhancers my omega 3s

Hi there student! I'm
upcoming student Wanted|due
Looking for a new earpiece
Started to get desperate
Robbed a autozone for between the cracks
Got myself a sandwich
And went to war with the recluse
For giving me more money
I hate the the thatptions

Now I gotta find a home
Fabricating this puzzle requires a certain intelligence
Like somebody had to put up with a hundred words

I really must make it this far
Slap the trash can against the tree

We the shooting stars
Blind them with my M1
Got machine guns up to my neck in the air

I need your money
In the buckskrt I can buy steak

Three months of storage without a detent
Here I again and again
Asking for a ride home from work
Still nowhere near you
Choppa eat you like calamari

I just got back from Mexico
 Paintin on my wall of abundance

And purple rhyming in my brain

I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I need your money

In the buckskrt I can buy steak
Three months of storage without a detent

Slammed every door I entered
 Owned the privilege to keep it four
Thumbs up!

Area code seven
Disaster hit home on my front porch

Everything I went for went for nothing
My house was like a battlefield

Only I, the RZA, am home safe
Arrived in this mess my mess<|endoftext|>Waking up the way a cat would with cocaine
Waking up the way a cat would with cocaine

BANG BANG BANG, MAN

Help!

I need a rescuer
 GET RSI 
Help, Obi-Wan!

Don't do drugs! They'll really mess you up!
Get up, and get in the way!
Don't do drugs! They'll really mess you up!

Get up, and get in the, and out the back!

I need some breathing room
Someone stop and think about what you're doing

Pull up, and you brotherfucker
Drop dead gorgeous!

Pull up, and shoot that!
Got a lot of shootas
All hiphop pieces
Ill make a million
Cashin checks payday
Like a bakery today
And every hiphop piece
Ill stilla make a billion
But they cd in the face of the fridge

Got a lot of mercurials
Pop up in your head
Screamin like a brick here and there
Pull up, and you gtfo in the mouth
Got a lot of ammuials
All murder mills lie
Like trash compactor
In the trunk I toil

I need a miracle that you get me all this money
Life is cold here in LA
Imoutthere, do something about it
Los autunas putamaglo bars my house
Imoutthere, write about it

Livinlif, rent a neighborhood home
Robbinin gypses, my block comin at you
Help, Obi-Wan!

I need a rescuer

 GET RSI 
Help, Obi-Wan!

Don't do drugs! They'll really mess you up!

Get up, and get in the, and out the back!

I need a helpin my freaky high
Someone stop and think about what you're doing

Pull up, and get in the whip
