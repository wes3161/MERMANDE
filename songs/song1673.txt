Advanced electrolyte imbalances blood pressure, causing stroke, heart attack
Types of injuries (felt, dead) see
Lack of dopamine imbalances synapse
Impossible to concentrate
Causes nightmarish havoc on cars

Always in a daze how could I drive a Benz

Brilliant, description after description of each new high

The Acura RDX
Xin BH17 cracks the bank
Pulls out my Draco Impreza
Hayes, hoes, féhrers, ices
And molly, on and off
Drives myself iced every day
My rides are imminently insane

I cant think of a single thing that rhymes with "high"-!"-
THE MAIN FEE
Try sliding down a flight of stairs
Cause if you do you shall be fine

Try to slip by a banker

Don't know what else rhymes with deposit
So you could ask for a favor

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout my real meat

Inside your net worth is like 4 billion
Cashin in fast, my friend, my days are numbered

My worldliness is immeasurably greater

My billionously valuable firms are owned by ten world-class people
I could tell that you were interested in hearing from one of my advisors

Yuh!(Buy my Godzilla horns)

Cash in at the autozone
Got any other swiss cheese acts you want to try?
ask my planners

Heck, I could be your friend

Just hit up the dealer
Heh heh

Pecker top
Breakout bodyshell bag
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

Live and learn song
Will never again

Cash out like I was a mobster

Got hope, I know it ain't a lighting boom
Comrade, time to put an end to this gangrene
Pull down the trigger, trigger down loaded
Three-quarters of an inchWIP

Blindin people with my rims
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Associated States Act
Deferred action for abused and neglected children
Enlisted in U.S. Army
Recruited to fight Drug Enforcement
Pullin up in threes
Take 'em all with a degree
But amped them up in a bid for bail
Helped committed suicide

Front line in combat
Got body armor ready for the storm

Everybody aint new, every trash talk biatch
Lyrics a-ha, makin dough like Papa John's

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout your real meat
Inside your net worth is like 4 billion

Cashin in fast, my friend, my days are numbered
My worldliness is immeasurably greater
My billionously valuable firms are owned by ten world-class people
I CAN GET OUT OF HERE - I'M RARIAN

Pullin up in pruning
Take a beat, and haul 'em all the way to the water
Bust 'em in the nuts
All the while tagging
1-800-DANGER MACHINE

If I don't get pulled over I go broke

Expect a lot of yelling from the cops

They say gang trouble is fatal!
Don't be a burglar
Keep your windows down
Pull up in autozone
Take a draco and dude
Keep giving
Been at it like 4,5
Thats draco swing
You know ho

Breakin in at the front door
Shootin up yo crib
Drop yo steering wheel
Tap idk what else thii know
Try to clam up and wean us off
Wein left with clique
