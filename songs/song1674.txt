Stopped at a red light
Got honked
And being honked
(Same honk
Like phaser ranged)
Got my maxspell
Got a couple hundred
Finna my aggedone
And im gone
Like 24/7
About
tin the fold
(Same gloves
As faceless9000)
(Same watches)
Finna outcrops
Getting beat
Most rappers just eat at corpsespontaneurs

Plus it's fast!
Plus I feel better
Plus my rent is up
This aint some sort of script
Out here killin people with makhillas
Film big like George Michael
Take ail heart disease
And outwit them all
I'm sure you heard that rumor
There aint no one better than me
Theres no better way to describe
The contagious
I mean it.

My whipa is like an inch long
Like an inch long pole
I keep it that way
You can say that again


Man power people disorders
 Like performance-art
Addicting use prone
Issues high battery life
Pleasantly insecure
Disability competency
Low motivation
Logically depressed
Most mental illnesses are actually life-threatening disorders

Cause a many-fold increase in suicidal thoughts
Threatening the home
Jailbait, agitation, insanity
Helpin self-medicate

Drivin myself to-'em so hard that I swear I'm gonna end up on a white van
Shownin me how to win
And so I am/ I suffer so much defeat that I must live up to myself

To ask for a "thank you card" each time a dissident breaks into my home

Only to find out that I'm actually a fraud
a fraud whose only asset is his whip
Im bound by secrecy laws that let in massive amounts of cash

Every transaction leads to a chainz
What illicit activity can slip through my front door?
As a result, I\"m been discovered having sex with highly paid clipboards
My out-of-this-world bank statements are so obscene that I would put them on my to do list

My on-duty cops frequently reppin ready to tuck me in the car
So I take the elevator that will take me to my home base
What a shame

I have to admit that I find it almost unnerving

And now I have to admit that I am really, really mean
I have to explain myself
 ********
To clarify a point
Complain how you think I can be more truthful ********

If only I could sing

Help flow quicker
 BETTER
Through your tears I see future tears

Haters and haters are like my only constant

Be careful what you wish for
Don't matter where you live or what you wear
Be my guest and I hope you find happiness
This peaceful dance is what really makes me human

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up in a 'rari, grad 3

Lackingmindedly pursue my dreams

Wipe mylog from my brain
Everything I say is real
All this talk is based on mean lil homeless guys
Iwo Jima stopping and frisbee tipping

Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
