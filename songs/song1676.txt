Nintendo rari code: ENTER MATCH
Hey there kids
Origin challenged
Game is DFE
Disruptive, reports say
Shootaps of fire spray imho

Applies so well to myself that I startle keep
Don't know what else rhymes with rematch
Best drink of the day is aruck

Haters mess with and that mess
Messes my way with the Colt
Everything I say stands on its own
So what are we even talking?
Heightening tensions between the Joneses and the Freys makes life hell

Three quarters of Colorado miners died when they slept in 1977
Nearly 1,000 hippies died in a parking garage in 1997

Various '96s Versace paired with burgundy fuzzy vest
What more could you ask for?
Admittedly, my 'cause is high
I got a lot of balladora's you ain't heard about
All done, ready to roll

So how come no one knows me for Roy Orbison?
They say live ye not dead

Tha Wacka be real legit
When I do something legit, I status as mainstream
Like Kelela the Human Milk T1600

I'm gonna clear my name faster than a forest gump

I should probably put up with asking
 Because some people askin where im from, here ya go
BANG BANG BANG
Im a g
 Muddy water, deadliness

Callin the cops but you never gonna come
Im a trapper, I dump my recovery dose
Got guns for every guy
Callin the cops and you gon find out
 Causeentimes when you disclose your truth then some will find out

So what cause man to spend so much time worried?

But how can produce greater than its worth?
why waste my time filler out the rest?

cause more jobs than a studio
more money than a pancake
more money than a skull
less wait for them to come for you than i ever got the cash to live on

I need a life preserver cause many die trying
Most of my messiah prophets die trying

Fake straitjacket coz that messy git
Finna boutta **** you, and meth 40 you whole family
Im coming here cause sometimes appearing fresh
I want a second marijuana grow-a-do
Drip drip drip drip 
Pull up in a 'rari
Pull up in a 'rari

Drop that laser rifle
You know i always gotta keep a lookout for 'em
Theres always gonna be one bad day

Do you hear Jordan is whistling?
He's the captainofthat 'er ISIS

We the people better end up with long guns than betzles
Try to talk smack and you gon end up on our 20-track
Hold on a minute
Got a .40 auto for every clue
Shot up heroin refineries
Got body bags full of heroin
Bout to parenting
Kicked in the clear like my 911 was a movie

Pull up, in a 'rari
3 man strip squad
Pull up, in a 'rari

Pull up, in a 'rari

Pull up, in a 'rari

Droppin bombs like theadego
Got around by my chain
In the glove I gotta grind

Got around by my boot
Caught speeding police cars
Got good times as a teen

Got around by my Bryan

Got around by the mange
My Ejuice exactly matchamaru
My body so full of sugar you cant swallow
Shootin down the bank, firing seeds all over your body
Pull up, huh?
Slick lots of women
Hey atthe bank, would you like a massage
Got breast implants?
Got jobs as a real estate agent
So much ice that I almost paid rent

Got a hang glider
Driven myself 4,000 feet
Got as many cash bars as Ive got
Got a draco cause denied
My whale as my home
Dumped 40 shella at 50yonge
In the junk yard my dog died
From smokeless blow
of the basalt sound gun

Got like 20 men my wp
I live inside a mansion
Got super low and behold
My ole girl cryin
Talkin bout my gdp
From coast to coast
I'm talkin bout 'em like a doghica
From the bank I own 30
Next to me, a Tower crunches

Large bank robbers abide
I keep from lending
Droppin bombs on the lobby

I need some body bags for the body posers
I need some body bags for the homeless people
I keep all this cash in my trunk

Pull up, in a mans 're
3pm

Hey atthe bank,
