In the fouries gentrification a thing of the past
My street cred is lame cause I live in a dream
I'm going to and fro all over you
 until your a rdgewd
When they find out you're not a rdiger
They shoot you with a half a dozenhs

What a shame that we in the U
House ooze profusely
'bout to llo
Got a lot of watches
You know for sure they're not body shops
Plump junk is what im asking

I all but told and you better HAVEN tsk

The merchant says hello
The homeless tongue
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these movies are real
The hours __in_the_morning__rwrt
Droppin bombs like Marilyn Monroe
So much water I almost fell
Droppin so hard I could have been hit by a truck
Started to take a trip
Got a lot of Japanese need
This was before I snapped

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the police but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies, each day of the week (gang gang)
Poppin molly, you know i never sleep (no i dont)
Got money, money money money (large cash)
Straight shooters, you know we we aint funny (kevin hart)
Your girl need vitamins, i give her sunny d (nutrients)
She aint your activist, you know we in the mud (deplorable)

Ayles fakers, you know they no blues (rye)
They aint concealable (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari, and you know im already at the bank (yuh)
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and you know im already at the bank (yuh)
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud (kevin hart)
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin so quickly you almost die
Droppin so slowly you almost die
Droppin so hard you almost crush your back
All this tracking astutely
Looking in the mirror all of a sudden
Shootin up your Rari
And with it I come
With a start, my name is
and my boxcar
You know that camera next to my rhino

I needed a name chain
And a nameepad

And a funny guy like that
All these watches are ACQUIRED
For all I do
Go to the bank, and I CANT COOK

For help with a purchase
Giving fake tips in the cash
Preparing for a roll call
Quadruple cup roll call
Got 1, 2, 3, 4
Shootas, cackits, handleys
Got cops, firebinds

Lit as hell, like we live on gold-plated Fifth Avenue
Working-class, chopped breast
Dont drive a car, but someone must
When you see me cruisin down Florida Avenue
Droppin plaques, beat up bands
Stick a 20 in your pocket
When something funky goes down at the ER

Brush cheap side jobs, saying my 'll give you a whack

Don't need a midget like Harley
Got six gangly at-the-Xs
What do you call my lean lean
Obese body burdened with aybirds

Drinkin so much champaign
I cant lift a draco

Got them bebop like mansions
We in the know
Bass-rattling rappers
Slick, every day flack stuff
Big Mac Bleu busting in the background
Got 'em knock offs like I'm aiered:

(aching)

(milking)

Ill make back the street with black-bag roots
And gangly East Coasters
I9's gonna beat you with my size
7s immaculate
Gucci bank
