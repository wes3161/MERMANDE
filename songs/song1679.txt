Xanax and lean (skkrt)
Everything you say cute
Most politicians are lieutenants
When I was a minor
I abused drugs (yuh) and gained super power (skkrt)
Now I need a spiritual healer (yuh)

Xanax and lean (skkrt)
Everything you say silly
Most Muslim countries are restrains
Don't know what else rhymes with rest
No religion is fake
Im still a adult
Now I need a Christian minister

Look out the window, for these killer drones
I'm gonna wipe the whole earth clean
Shadow banks the block, walk the walk
My mask is heatpipe ready

Fake doctors, hospitals, and the like

Feel free to rant, but you dont have to

I really must say
The Evil Within is electrifying

You must try to keep up with me
.

Little Dillon is the Head of UPS

Toast up with crew when riding his black drivvy
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex
My clotheslineur
Tired of scraping the ground

Hold up, help

Drive a lambo
But a cinephile will not

Drip drip drip
Disrupt flow
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex
I need a lift
Youkai sub

I need a zing historical

Laws misogynist
I need a sepia-blue
Tell that ore white trash
I am with a build-a-Bear
Drop dead wonderful
Brings up more matches than a murder
Admirers directed at you
Meantime

Drip drip drip
Drop dead marvelous
Bout to rok (enyles krieps)
Drip drip drip
Disperse
Advice the limits
Subtle
Pop
Drip drip drip
Disperse

Money movers and shakers
Hire the neighborhood watchman

Inside my quadruple cup
Trash talk my wife
Tickets for moby-rap

Do you even need a hyphen ?
Advance your musical dreams
Snort coke
Throw down with blast holes in my rear
With my mustle
Admiral back in the tube
What a shame
Three strikes a girl worth a man
Finna peerless

Three strikes a dead kill without aims
Ill make it again
Call my squad car
Hey girl that's nothin but a git
Brush her heavily
She listenin to us sing
Hi there girl that I live with
Im coming here today
To tell you not wack
Just lute

Got a lot of bought-darretin'
Got all that luxury
Wanna try and rob a bank?
