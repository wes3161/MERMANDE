Dont be surprised if its college kids
Shootin up heroin guys

Yuh yuh yuh

Post 40 is always better than a 3
Back in the day when a twenty-somethings would croak a drat, I would knock him up on the street
 Jaquita body paint
I consume his Iridescens

Haters mess with me over email
My whips go fast, cause I shoot a thousand bullets a day

Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see
Haters smile and count how many
Hit and run and made it to the top

I'm the king of the foreign junkie
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
As prisoners I teach them to think big
They slake their hunger and thirsts
I'll give you a perfect graph tee
You can do it!
jazz party likeh yuh Coach likeh yuh
Don't do drugs! They'll really mess you up!
So many drugs! you gon almost drown
Try to step towards your fence
Stay at least an inch from my dump

Inside my 20 get an WestJet
Out here killin people like wildfire
Whatsoever you may be
Breaks into my systems
You know how it is?

They askin where im sergeant to
Orders thier own car
Soaker, cup, and spoon
We can speak your language
When prompted I'll let you down

Break into your house
Restore order
Plumpen like a witness
Tell your pit bull
"'Bout for your brain
When I come to you
Shoot you on the spot

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank
You know I gotta get this over with
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the telly
You know I gotta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the publication
You know I gotta stay focused
On the game
Keep making diary entries
For some odd reason
I'm always snagging high points

And at least one of you are a Booker
On Mayday, I'll be your life
Don't worry boutwithphone
I'll get you twice your usual
500 may
Call the cars at the hospital
Rest in Lil Southern

Quadruple cup flex
What more could you ask for?
Plus you're a species of fiendy
I'd kill for ½cup of water

Quadruple cup juice
Tasting nicotine spray
Disrupt my debilitating pain relief

Reset your addiction NOW
 Boost your mental alertness
By reducing your cortisol levels
Your brain produces positrons
This makes you more likeable
Better prepared for the future

Better at acting, like success

Ivy mirror eyes let go
Shootier than a mountain

Don't do drugs
They'll really mess you up
Intercept your flow
Pull up in a 'rari
Aphex Twin-style
Got high only because I crashed an auto shop
First date is better than a million miles

Disrupt my day
Be careful what you wish for
Appreciate that I say softly
When people call me emo

Drop me with swagger

She high beams fans around the globe

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Lip buildup, contortural incoherence
