Ice skates
Bout to mow all my haters down

Diamonds on my ring
Got a mellow album in my rent
We going to Sicily for a sound check?
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, I know.
Send in the Predator

Drop 30 kills in a fight
Drive an R8 911
Beat your every sobriquet
Talk trash like Jimmy Hoffa

My whip ain't spongy
I leave you with the tired feeling

Better get the hell out my way
In the glove I gotta Draco

Die guilty feel free to dissaproat

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and cash (hmu)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Xanax and lean (yuh)
Xanax and molly (dskrt)
Xanax and lolly (ddhk)
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz
Then I pull up in the rari
With my shooters you'll be sorry

My armory, expansive
My catapult aint passive
Tha barret is be massive
My draco is jurassic

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Lipity loppity
momidy robbity
 tongue so floppity
hippity hoppity
 Me llama you a comedy
IQ bring homogeny 
Levelheadedness amount
LIP LAB DAB RAB OLAB
 Man visual range:ng
Glasses all over me
Like I was toilet paper
Illve put some real effort into myself

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list

Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist

Been here from the start no one knows you exist 

Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz
Then I pull up in the rari
With my shooters you'll be sorry

I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list

Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist

Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I’ll clear you out like Brooke Lefkof up
Keep on selling like Darcy Yell
We the untouchable
Pull up in a 'rari
Take a 'rari robbity
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I’ll clear you out like Alessandro Nuno
His body wants to party
Make it to the elevator
All my kills look like his head
Don't need a Schmidt srp
All my abilities are foreign whips
They'll really mess you up
You never know
When somebody uses a non body including your head
I'll nuke an apartment in a minute
Shoot your floor with a flická
You ain't gon live to see 40 (uh)

Show no mercy to those without need
They may well be my counselors

'Til we leave no one knows
What's up
 Roll up in that car and we'll starve ya
Paramore snort RPGs on demand
I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get
