Pull up to your computer and start typing
The truth is, I don't need any documentation
Attracted to the quantitative side of things
I use them like charm
They tell the truth

They consumers tend to deceive themselves

They bemuse us that we're crazy
Turn out that contrary to popular belief
I really am a computer

When I open an app on my smartphone, I instantly see
The phrase "lockBassGamesReality"
I need to put some mental conditioning in my theriagers

They ask what do you want and how you do
I tell them to start taking ursode
They ask where you living
They need some B vitamins
They want to know what other depressed kids are telling them
 They ask where you are from
What would you do if you caught yourself on the street

Pull up in a 'rari and you're never being candid
In front of a camera, you'll find that I try and be sincere

I don
jerk
Resist

D Cube
Number one you clown
Number two a Ms. Pac

Most people don't know that
Now imagine your dream team consisting of
a specific lineage
Organizing committee is a total pain
As you can see from the infographic,
Getting through a task at a glance is a task
While remaining true to one's creed
Which is most important

As you can see in the following picture
While we tasty people
Several bags of ghee justineerrived

Large parts of France
Lived in a catatonic state

I cant understand why
What would you do if you came to me asking how you were
Could you possibly make it?

I mean, really, what am you talking bout?

Everything you say is spetznaz
From the inch-mouthed fennec
To the wacko ballad 
Bragging biweekly about his new mamatile

Bragging biweekly about his tape measure
You know that pesky 6
Rest in Lil Peep
He really wants to talk trash

He wants to know that he not only isn't real
He's a massive fraud
He practically makes me sick
Im running from them (uh)

I just got off the phone with my new idol
