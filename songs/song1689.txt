NBA 2KOH rippling in my face
All my ranged weaponry firing
Causing great suffering
Droppin bombs like dino skanks
I’m floppin with so much ice that I’m fakin beat
Im dripin with so much gasoline like a bloc
Soiler trucks shooting at me
My jets am pumping with diesel
I am melting down towns like the
Belgian middle class
I’m crumbling property lines
My rent is so good that I can buy a home
I need a life preserver
The other day I was talking to some guy
He told me about his stupa
He called himself Droppin
He told me how he was a genius
And now I’m a stupipos

Three time capsules in my purse
Wallet over my head like an object

Said something went wrong while taking a walk
I told my brain to just stay at home

It's a challenge each day
To stay sane
I still get it
You only put 5th
Life is hardwired in us
 That if we keep on drinking we'll slip

Choppa eat you, lay waste to everything
To myself I think I'm insane

Every day since I started taking this pain relieving medicine
It takes me back to square one

Don't get me wrong - I enjoy taking these pills -they are just not on my top 10

They take my willpower, my sobriety, and my sanity
I mean really, man -they are just some of the other compilations
They even come with a built in trigger guard

Hold up, I need some use
 Too late, my arm is already full
Don't worry, I'll get through this
Call my bluff and you may find that you tooll be a millionaire
TIP: Be bold, and you may find that you tooll be a real killer

Breakfasts are upon us
And around the bend
We can do it.
Thousandfold it

Leaking at will
Drip drip drip
Drop drip drip
Drip drip
Now think of all the chores I could do
Clean, make sauces, buy fresh donuts
Clean, make stoves, buy heat exchangers
I should build a bigger garage

Large tanks for storage
My future always sunny
Never worry about it
Just focus on what matters

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout some highly regarded brands
I want some right now
 Trade these checks that I've got for my coffers
Got the bankout lookin
In bold supersized
Improvised blasts cause massive amounts of panic
Initiated trips to the moon
Livin down cause no one asks
I wish I had a heart attack

Fake diabetes cause even some of my pills get swallowed
Initiated trips to the future
Still holdin high some of my top-shelf products (see below)
Large cash preshare
I should build a subway tunnel

Better get the hell out my way
Startnin more stores than I need
Should take Mars from here on out
Ship pizza on board my yacht

Large cash-strapped
Imposing taxes I should abolish

Look at all these private jets I have
My total wealth is at least $700M

Put my wealth at $7x assets

Large cash-strapped
My net worth is at almost $10B

Put all my money that I have at home and spend it on personal projects
As the IRS mandate, I have a new fad!
