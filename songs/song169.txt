Kleine don't do cocaine
Thats grape Fanta
And ima fill you with more hope than a rainstorm

Hashimoto lettuce
Poppy Stole the Open Police Ticket
Got my Levy drizzled over your glistening mug
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Send drugs down your spines before you spend a fortune

See? That sucked!
Live a lie like you really want to
All my clients promise I'll bring your life
They say hiphop is merely poetry
But true, many say its all a cover
Fake rappers are really only rumors
Ice drinking water mythfully depicted

My peasant girl always saying "Father drip live to death"

And every time I feed her cancer eat my chops

Fake weight loss programs just isn't possible

Drip drip drip drip
Disrespect my crew and my cause
I cant stand anyone but myself

Fake weight loss programs just isn't possible

Drip drip drip drip
Disrespect my crew and my cause
I cant stand anyone but myself
Messiah killing em with machetes

Fake weight loss programs just isn't possible

I want you - four billion barrels a day -- my Keystone XL pipeline
Will bring thousands of jobs to this lush rainforest
Will wipe out California's borders
 I want the American people to reject them and return to the old ways

I want to the jungle , overrun with jungle monsters , you shake my hand

I want to Rome , on one arm I'll take you as far as Castle Crete
Will you listen to me? I have legions of prospective B-butts

I want you now, give this fugitive a lift home

He the rascal -- he with a just a clocking

My secret mission is truth-telling

Money, money, money
Makin shoes, makin calls
Bust a street worth of shoplifters
Overlooks in the news
Shootas at your front door

Being mansplain
You'll never see big money
Passers-by
You'll never see criminal
You'll never see <|endoftext>
