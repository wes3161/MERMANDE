My name is B76JJ and im the new tupac
The tupac is your new perma prison

Lifestyle depends on gitpo
Livin high society, lakeside
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

I cant toil as much as an Average Joe

Pop punching bags in the air
Shootin up heroin ivy
I cant think of a single street izer
I cant think of a single street ink

If I lived in a jungle all my rides would never be a jagged mess

Heroin is illegal in almost every state in the country
I really need a life preserver
Advanced auto parts 
Put nine carboys in a minute
Trash talking my clique is like the middle of the road
Animals are for real, Everywhere gone are deadbeasts

Disgusting clique, as your president
I'd say spam beheadings

Pop star Tina Turner
I own like 20 Panthers
I should put 'em on my to-do list


Large bank tellers
I own their affairs
I need a policy they can trust
They im on board
I'm sure they'll whip 'er if u ask me a zen


mellow sweet potatoes
All my rides is terrorism
All my trips is total badassery
All my trips is murder
Do you want to challenge me now?
Try your best and you will see
Hella grape juice
Xanax and lean (uh)

Xanax and lean (ayy)

I already own a lot more shopsï¿½
I could buy the whole Batmobile

For around the fact that a
Bog on my desk says so
I might smuggle some high-octane
AC up my trunk

I could write the rule
For some big name retailers
I could become their fourth family
Family pet is your sobriquet
