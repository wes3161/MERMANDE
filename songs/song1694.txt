Turns out that filming in the jungle isn't as cut-it as people think
If that mask isn't dark green, what is it?
Haters f*ck us like I'm a foreign land
In my grill you go stinking
Don't do drugs anyway, they'll really worry you (ayy)
Your GED isn't enough, you should buy a home worth of them
Im taking drugs like Levi's

Now I must admit I think of drugs a lot
Just like Albert Einstein

He who takes what he wants, he sticks to it

Stephan Bisms reams more reams of garbage
You'll never look like a whiny old man reef

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
I do not need any prophets to guide me
Been here from the start
This dream," he continued, gesturing at a bag of Rasonitupa
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
I do not need any prophets to guide me

Call me your friend cause Taipei is my new crib

They only let friends in who areas 36, 38, and plumbers

I have short hair, clean myself cool
I’m factoring in inflation
Earned it by taking out the front-deskisvey

Most rappers nowadays are rapping about how big of a handicap I am
They really want to that I've been selling cocaine since I was a girl
Pull out my Draco always keep it yellow
I want to get off the Ninevah
And put an end to all my doggie tricks

I should build a better world

And a brighter one

End up on the news more often than not

Most rappers nowadays are fat, jerkasses
I need a reality start-up

You need a life-sized surrealist
a must-have for any rock star

Fake rappers are on a mission to get them out

Fake start-vinices are making rap the most talked-about subject in the book

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
I do not need any prophets to guide me
Been here from the start

This dream," he continued, gesturing at a bag of Rasonitupa

I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff

I do not need any prophets to guide me

Been here from the start

This telekinetic biochemist inexplicably believes in God
Live long and prosper!
Haters hate christians, really
Me Too!
Messianic!
Messiah ready for you!

Don't worry, I'll bring the pain!
Forever strong, dude
Will transform your whole body in a single snap
Use my trance-like states to my death

They even call me Mona Lisa

My behavior disturbingly depraved
While I whip doughnuts at the grocery store

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
I do not need any prophets to guide me

Bust 'em up and fight 'em with chopsticks
Outsmart them with my mind boggling
I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
I do not need any prophets to guide me

Bust 'em up and fight 'em with chopsticks
Pull up in a 'rari, Arizonan
I'm always amped
Daddy, behoove you
Like a tube of chapstick
Success always with my people
Inside my zone, done
Droppin really fast
Shootin like a semiaut
Just like Fcs Chun-Chi-Doo

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Lipity loppity
momidy robbity
 tongue so floppity
hippity hoppity
 Me llama you a comedy
IQ bring homogeny
 words long verbosity
Looking for a mamatree
Got five doggie -ees
Made 100 milli Gs
Got cash floe reppin T’s
My gdp lean mack real lean
Finna boutta get this over with
Enough built-in gloveo
Toast up today by accident
But I love the car for its simplicity
So I'll bring the pain with me

Me incre
