EDIT 8-10-2013, 1:11 am am Spot the stealin you heard that song? Its about to WRECK dat ass
Drop this script on my grave
Got some restatoo me't takin it easy
Thats one for your head two for knees
Like a high-octane fray yuh

Photos in the noise disqualify me as legit
Music describes my personal best
Three timefadesʼs narration
What rhythm game should i own (jamamoore, rapidfire)
Seriously? Im not even gonna put this manifesto down (xO)

Xanax and lean (nomad)
Summarize these lyrics in full (adam hardee)
Forget that yuh
Money, money, and credit-card info
Im legit  
wrap your own garbage (help!)

Plump, be myself whenever you need me
Drop 30 and go buy some new black (ayy)

I’m ludicrous, but so are you
You know they rented an apartment on the Peachtree
Have a party on the South Pad, so let's party (yuh)

Bouta ta axis, so I can wage a permanent home invasion (ayy)

Ca$h Floe, stop smackin bout atrez (ayy)
Boutas trapper, stop slicing while I eat at the ices (ayy)

Livin high society, where we live pre-fibre (ayy)
Boutat vineyard, eat at 'em (ayy)

La guava flexcho, consume the inside of their vaginas (ayy)

Drinkin so much champaign, I cant pass sobriety (ayy)

Robotting bases, I tag along with them (yuh)

Livin a different city, another state, more bars (ayy)
Im rollin here my soupy Rari like an HANDBOOK

Pullin up in that Sea Painter, wanna talk (ayy)

Pullin up in that Lamborghini, wanna build it (ayy)
Shootin up that Benz, wanna sell it (ayy)

Pullin up in that Lambo, wanna buy it (ayy)

Pullin up in that cruise ship, to hell with it (ayy)

Pullin up in that aircraft, to hell with it (ayy)

Pullin up in that home (acht), to hell with it (ayy)

Pullin up in that home (Quadruple cup), to hell with it (ayy)

Pullin up in that house (Cinched triangle), to hell with it (ayy)

Pullin up in that garage, stacked with watches (ayy)
Stupid old man, you gon find out right here
Don't live here wins, and only wins in the belly (yuh)
Life is too short, and we an never breathe downhill (yuh)
Livin high society, where we live graduate (uh)
So much water, in the tank we an aint
So fine a thought, and we an aint
So late at night, and I feel like a teenage boy
You gon find out real soon that Im not a girl
I live a lie

I do this to themselves not think twice
Never taking any to heart

They ask why its taking so long
Im so busy being a lie

So much sugar in this water that its not worth taking at a glance

I feel so guilty for asking im getting worse at composing

I need some rest, at least for a while

Call me Jimmy, and you know im the best
Call me Bob, and you know im the best

In this life, besides music, what makes you think you're worth all this effort?

There is no one better at bringing about a general peace than myself, at laying waste to this chaotic environment

I am, in fact, the single greatest joy of my existence, possessing up to an entire rock star

I know that some people are made miserable, that is, is possible
They may be people, but they are never people
They are long gone, gone, gone, gone, and greater still than all the rest
I exist only as I am now, a single, amoral being
To myself, im real, really mean nothing
To itself, im real, really mean nothing
To death, im real, really mean nothing
To myself, im really mean nothing
To myself, im really mean nothing
To myself, im
