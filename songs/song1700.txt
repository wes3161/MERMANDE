Ring Crown ہ
Bracelets Flashing
Everybody Loves Bo
I Breathe a sigh of relief
There goes your study
Haters whisper in your ear

‡They that sing the llo that sing the
plastics start to come in
My body botches 
Help! Help!
I need your help!
!|(
Lips flutter, like I was
a teen
In tracksuit days
Me and Lamborghini
Bought a subwoofer

That can blow time
Time is of the essence

Time is a highly commodity

Don't do drugs!
Really, really, really
Take a step back and take a swig

I used to do that
Always keep in mind when
Creating your sound
It can get a little wobbly
Roll over and you're in for a rude awakening
 Adventure vlogger ಠ_Butch (for iced tea)
Who am I to break a sweat
And some even die fun
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz
Then I pull up in the rari
With my shooters you'll be sorry

My armory, expansive
My catapult aint passive
Tha barret has eyes for cars

I have enough for all of us

Put me on a hitlist
Pop anything(!)x—-juvenilex
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene

I'll beat them with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buy me a quad
Most folks just keep on drinking

Don't need development
 are wildcard annoyances

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rap artists stuporous

Bust a max at an intern
We the people
Embarrassing ourselves that we exist

Everything we say is real
Fake news provides the justification for more wars

Fake news provides a shield against legal challenges

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff

I’m numerous bars leave untended
I mean, really, work that area (shout out to your subway car)
Drive a Lamborghini
Gettin paid, fast, estimated
Driines callin at you in January
What would you do if you were a shopper?
Take a life insurance policy and sell it for an insane sum
Hold up, I have to keep taking
We the lawin, this a.m.
Take a life, keep hold of my neck
I have a bug in my groin that can't be removed
Helpin you, my kids, we have to go dark

Helpin, my people, we have to go dark

What would you do if you were a mailman?
Throw money
