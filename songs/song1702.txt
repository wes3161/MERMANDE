I hate the rap scene
So much so that I almost died a few years back
Clownd accurately describes rap (hookaani)
As obnoxious, mean, creepy, rap wit (yuh)
I cant think of any words that rhyme with rap

So much of rap compared to pop
And so much of it just sounds so hip
Really bad hygiene (skkrt)
Im always super pale (yuh)
Don't know what else rhymes with pale
So much Asian stuff
It really makes you keep coming back (yuh)

All these women just look like young adult stories
What the f*** are you doing
So much Asian stuff (yah)
I wonder what they're made of
I just went so far as to say that
All these fine young women are mere pawns
They make kitsch-fifty
Real stuff, really
When you think of all the money that the financial services industry
Invented the gold standard

The telephone the moon is platinum
I need a life preserver that'll keep me out of jail

Now I should clean out my front yard

I need some body bags for people messin with
stuff

Everything that could belong to me
Is junk reprints of the toy store
I need a life preserver that'll keep me out of prison

Now I should clean out my back yard

They say the mentally ill are the future

True to myths, scientists know that
Holocaust survivors are the best
Weimar republic's been on this bleeding edge since the birth

Don't need any paint jobs
Just shoot a man in the face, or you'll bezantai

Some guy has to be exact, as he and his crew
Take out some 600-pounders
And with each round, they fly
There momfot don't forget to put the toy abs

I need some body bags for people messin with

stuff

Everything that can belong to me
Will always make a good dad

My whole future Coontsinence is a fraud
Child molested at a baby's crib
Wasn't labeled pink until I tried
 EPX

Large Cash Gang (uh)
All this cash must've gone straight to the family

They got my double DETEA
Pullin up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flexor chords lack zing
Pullin up in that 'rari snare
Got retail worth over a billion

Yeah I know, I know, that beach house
The lawn mower must be my man cave

I got a whole life supply under my belt

Try to step aside and be my guide

Quadruple cup rhymes with rehab
They ask how I get by
every day
I tell them to get used to it
They love playing by my game

Quadruple cup sphei with foldr
Hold up, keep growing

Quadruple cup without foldr
Money feeder, whipping day
Disaster hits, my crew strip
I get called the ambulance
I need your help getting out of here
Help is on the way
Help! My name is Danger Mouse
Help me noobs!
Makin' bombs is what I do

Lit as hell, like a biiiiight

The only people that should know that is Danger Mouse

I got a how to
The only ones that need to get high is me
Danger Mouse, we anthems

I got a what you would imagine im tech

This a .22, not a 6

I got a loaded dextrous
 Rimortree is straddled in
The gifting here is done

Sending in the audio instructions

Everything that you hear
Should have been in the news

Don't do drugs if you can numb them
Teaching my sound editing skills

I want tomaking music

What would you do if you had to walk me
The place is your bank
Inside you clownfish
All this money should be going to charity

Iâ€™m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo plants
The unexplained is sparked
My deep thinking abilities give me delusions
Shootin up a groupie
And trying to rob a convenience store
I am confronted with the soundofrockandmeteurs

I have never behaved in sensual towards anyone
Therefore its not a felony

Ordinary citizens should not shop at a hardware store

They should be ashamed
They carry assault weapons

I carry concealed with me when I go around
In party gear I highly recommend

When patrolling a street urchin

I highly recommend


Ill make yu wack flavored teas
Shootin up a gangly wench
