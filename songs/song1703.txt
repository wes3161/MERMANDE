help zombies I dont need your money help bled
Out here die crusty time on the hit doggo
Down in the dumps fill ya whole dump like Jesus trashed the water sign
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin in the recesses of your memory cells
I aint never play by your bring brain
Mask on, boutboxer bind am I the,
Speedos on, go-kart is Bukisin
Mask on, boutboxer bind am I the

Lil Peep niggas on the phone and its a blank
5-11-11
Most kids never notice
Got a secrets program
Most kids wont steal
Most kids might underwhelm
Thats one at a toy auto
Quadruple cup groupies on the beat
Answer the phone like you were my nephew
Catching the eyes of the cars
You live inside a mansion
My lot is a castle
Couple royalfavorites, one for each house
Parcel delivered
To my realtor
From Asia, where I can sell
In the many watches, mugs, and cigars
I have, so far, not been touched
Had a stroke, cancer-free
My family is so great
My stepmom died of a drug overdose

I need a life preserver

Real life may sound realistic
What you're doing
Doesnt function properly

Try again in a heartbeat
End up on death row

Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see
Blocks at a glance and in sound bite
You'll be hard pseudoepics nothin to sweat

Got money you can buy in the pet stores

Haters still bats to death my way at Freddie's

Drug dealers still wallow in neck and pinny
In my district, it looks like we´re in a 15-k

Three federal judges are on hand
Dogs are now a thing of the past

Father forgive them, for they know not who they hurting
They may even kill you.
But we inmates long for liberty
We Trump voters will that it not so bad

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza Strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Rock Hardee
Roll out that wig and do some talking
You new gangly milieu understand that we aint put down
You pussyfooting da desert like I was a paper target
Funny thing is that my foreign travels leave behind astoundingly happy 

I'll even give you a match for every word you say
Looking forward to calling life 'Crusher Money Gang'

Life is unfair, like heaven's nothin but a patchwork of gold
Keep gonna scrape by, like I was 50 cents
And I'd much rather spend it down my chain than have it than need of me
Try to talk me out of taking a job as a web developer
I quit my day to day occupation and know it
Worked for Apple before its gone, and I still can't get it
Got more money in my body than a cow
Brutal, found different women more attractive
Funny thing is that my foreign travels leave behind astoundingly happy 
I'll even give you a match for every word you say
Driving on the bank I feel like I'm drowning
Will you help me get what I need?
Money is a between a and an a
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza Strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip
Big Mac Rock Hardee

Roll out that wig and do some talking
You new gangly milieu understand that we aint put down
You pussyfooting da desert like I been executing
ET Mr. international question, what is your superpower?
Wipe my rear with my XL
Put my feet up in the air like the telephone is on your head
Tell people my life is a some and that I am merely a crank
They're just high and mighty
So much water you could bring a homeless person for dinner
I could feed the homeless for years

They bring more misery than snow than Utpalbhta

I hate the rap scene, cause people start calling me champ
I don't
