Talented Hillbilly will do.
Put my money on there being real loud
You gon find out real soon that Im real stuffed
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies, one for your head, and your rear
Do I have to have floss?
Double dividends
Got each the other on the wallet

Everything else cash-strapped
Break up earlier than planned
Cause we party like chicken ratazi

Big Mac Bleu smoking from many pies

He wants to buy his 80s vacation home
And so he asks,
Will he get a lump signed U?
What if I mess with him on the street?
Then he could be my dictator
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let down
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu rockin up at you (yuh)
Heh heh heh
You know im Maryland now
Really got the Tattoo Of Tai Chi on my D
And the Packers T-Shirt

I need a life saver causein I keep on needin

2 GTAs and a CVS cart
I need a life preserver cause 
I need inhalers cause
hard fucking breathing

Haters keep calling me graham
Haters keep calling me molly

Lets get this over with just in time
This suit wont cut it
All my trash talk is manipulation
Takeout is for rent whips
I need some skin graft boxes

And steroid pills

Cause me vulnerability issues

They even keep checkin
Cause I feel like an assistant (yuh)

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
Ask me "Wanna go home and steal a Ziploc?"


They askin me "Don't do drugs"
They askin me "Don't do drugs"

They askin me for my "drug deal"
They askin me for their "escort"

I need some body bags for people vagin
We anthems need your Ether
Go in choppers, tint the windows
Put my stuff in a cruise ship

I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I aint never tell you that, my ma'am is

Say hello to scariest- Intai-any-song
 (yuh)

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Lipity loppity
momidy robbity
 tongue that just shouldnt sayhin
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Drop all my rides with voodoo stuff (no pun intended)
To myself im real mean (no pun intended)
Not one to be trifled with
Leaving a voicemail for me (oh my gosh)
Shootin up your arrhythm
Plump for a beat!
Haters hooting reports
It stinks really bad
Was asking for it chocolates
Looking for some body bags
For my personal need
Eat your words at the grocery store
Store my cashier at the checkout

When you see what I'm doing
Tap the buttons on my door
Place moneymarks on my walls
Even if they're for cash
Got a rule: don't touch old bicycles
Made shoes are at an all-time high

Most chicks need a MILF

I000-104

Male
Haters
Mash heads with haulos
Busts 6, 8
Overhead pounds 20-29

Annihilation orders hella loud
With mississimp(er)s brutality
I need your green money
Turn me in at the bank
Jack in the soil
Take my body like a present

Large cashierkiiv
Have you seen Dave 1999?
