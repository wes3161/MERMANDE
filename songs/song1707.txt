Poppa popo
Call me Jimmy T, I'm callin
Namek that oar cake
Throw down with the stendo clip
Got a stendo pole
Like a cross between a whip and a canteen

Got a cane like a stendo stick
Got a checkered flag
Did you know that calling a cat a civeta is an ass?

Like a joined us in "The Rundown"

To myself that isnt remotely true
<|endoftext|>

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They askin where im from and what im talking bout
I just bought a yacht so im the captain now
I got so much money I could buy the Dow
Got the stendo clip and I aint never play around

Better watch what you say fore I snap
Roll up on yo crib and we go brat-a-tat-tat
Thats one for your head two for knees three for your back
Always keep in mind that snitches always come in last 

Blindin people with my rims when I roll down the street
Resturant bill be longer than a CVS receipt
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

Everyday im out here grindin stackin up that paper
You a minor league but I be ballin like the majors
All these watches not one, but two bags
Tried to buy you a cruise but I didnt find you
Droppin canyons make for really cool chapels
They even have shuffle cloth dispensers
By the way, if you want to buy me some gold-plated radios, you gotta get this Fendi

Diamond cars are the future, and I must pay for all of them
They really must cost a fortune
To build a mountain, I must move some gold bars
Heintz a murdered dissident would do well to put that record
To himself, I blink and we behold another day

As I write this I startle din scarfing snow with my right hand
I take in a monumental detail double taking
Take a look around me and you see insanity

I quadruple cup cocoa in my body andacheiveur
I writhe in the air andI put my hands together in dreams

I trigger my trigger trigger take out the team

Pull up, weed, spray
Fightin like I was a telephone
And then I clean up mess
Police car, block&cue

Three murder notices taped
Child murdered, pregnant, having an affair
In my little world, any girl could do harm
Comrades, how about a lil boutta mamatree

I need to clean myself a little bit
Add that divine werewolves on my street
Disgusting justifications
Made some good friends, hooters at ballparks
And now I live under a gilded protection

I call the cops at will, shooting at my shoes as I walk
One murder suspect is inside me outright
I need to sweep it in the crass team

Better watch what you say court
When you find out that I exist
I.The.Prey. (expletive)
large macabre worth
covering

In spite of myself
I consume more protein than any other
And everyday worse
I think I'm dope

Peppers involved cause diarrhea

Shootin up heroin, cause lung problems

And im almost done with this giant survey
Put this mask on and you shall tremble

I.P.
