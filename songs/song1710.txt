Ice cream shop, subway, down the street
Diamonds on my ring, hoe stapler
Everything I say is real
Ring 4 the coopers, the snitches
I want at a drivein' party

I got a stealin car, so I can steal a million
Ring sense is without a doubt top
9 Beyblades blazed, no trespassing
I need your help getting trade bars
Area one australia(!á•™ng)
Got all this ice like I was a telephone
Out here killin people, not do drugs
Just do your tactical thinking
In the threat board you should check for weaknesses
And if you find anything, report it

Never say die, just find out for sure

OH SHIT LOOK AT ME RAPEIEC
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean

Shootin up Slayer and verse verse
Gotta rap music you know im goin broke

Fake hype backstreet named Cuomo
The Rock for Jesus started out like a lie
Thats bone fide Sufjan Stevens
Haters lindseyes roundup
Call the cops but don't roll the whistle
My career is over love and (listen)
Nothing but good ole Missy Willocks
Lyrics dope as furs, handbags, gloves
Try to talk smack and you gon end up on a hitlist
Trash talking my frame is like an adolescent queblazin
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean

Shootin up Slayer and verse verse
Gotta rap music you know im goin repeat (uh)
Don't pull up cause I shut my face in
And you don't see me

Cause all these other rappers are Dr. Seus
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im dying of thirst right now
Don't rap because I could cause the ground to rise

I would really like to be Pope but I have to buy in

I need to convince my crew that life is worth living

They're fake rappers and theyre lookalikes
I need a whole life change for myself
Call the cops but don't roll the whistle

My career is over and I am dead
.



Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask onMask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Take a beat, and steal somebody else's flow
But they gon bump it cause the cover say its cash floe
Drive a lambo, glovebox full of bands
Dont drive a toyota because its made in japan
Downtown, people asking bout my cheddar
Brush em off, I dont deal with no beggars
Gettin paid, you know that im legit
Drivin on the wrong side like im a Brit
Cashin checks, my crib is like a castle
Like Spongbob, you live inside a pineapple
Covered in red, tellin people its just paint
Another fake gangtsa out here dead, myself and my crew

I got gloves, keep my trigger finger clean
Droppin bombs like a camp
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies, every day
Day bar none
TIP: If you need me, phish ask them where im from
