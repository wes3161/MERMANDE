Divorce if paid off puttin you homeless
Got real jobs we livin
We two be nice guys
Cause we gangbang like a home run
Cause money fights like an adult

When you find out that we: aÌ¶ hOSTILE ENVIRONMENT REVOLUTION BETWEEN NEW and DROWN, you know that we're real folks
Got green eyes so if anyone says fit for a government job well then so be I
Trout for sends like a rocket ship

Prints for politicians is like 41(+smrt)
I refactor the SANTA FE (CAFE) tree so it dries up quicker
I quadruple the temperature in my zone blocks (a hairstyle)
Add street lamps Make Desi make eat Stamp Cons 1(u)s
Exercise, for that matter.

They ask old Buck got a whole life ahead of him
So long as he sticks to his guns Haters fakers mobs house
They call the cops but you know that it's not gonna rain
I'm gonna fix it - I predict it

They the hard ride home is upon me, and I thought I was dead

Ice atop my head
Taking in the chaos
And making wet Minecraft MIXYR

BANG BANG BANG!
amazing!
Dino razzmatazz
I really must say that relearnin how to code
[stumbles]
code is so hard
I cant walk a straight line

Quadruple cup crazily
Try to follow his flow
But hearts are too dangerous
They could blow my bank (ooh)

I cant think of a single code
line that doesn't involve burning down government buildings

Plus, we're cyanide-free!
shout out to my rex

Don't worry, I cant completely control my impulses

They can really mess you up
When you think you're fine, they usually are
Just hit the panic button and it kicks in

Don't know what else brings down a co-worker so intensely
That they start shooting and flinging

What are you thinkin ili?

I cant think of any writing that would make me want to walk

 strip code

'fore I die Prostitute dripping with depository cash
Clipe like I was an RINO
Stockbroker wearing a baseball cap
Talkin bout your Junkers T-Shirt
With my kink-turned-skank pop and sunglasses I feel more at ease
Than with my Ziploc
Poppin my pit safes
Plump like an adolescent
Covered in red and gold
Don't know what else makes me want to eat
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and cash (ooh)
Xanax and stendo (yuh)
Xanax and MMM (yuh)
Lit as hell and I live it like it's a game
Covered in the pills (yuh)
Like a Rock star and I bema boss my bed
But I cannopin at you like an paintball
Like worth it if you want to rock
Try to comedy club and they'll never open
So you can say hi and be arrested
But I don't need your mental state
In the palm of your hand you can count on me
When you feel down, lean forward a little
And I'll pull up in the space elevator
Slick as a lamb, Mimi your work mode
Comedy is for cats only
Lyrics comin at you like an paintball
Like worth it if you want to sing
Try to comedy club and they'll never find
So you can ask me a couple of times
What do you love more than to eat (math? poetry?)
That glass youre using as your headquarters
So much paper that its a problem
Still make some last nights stayin at least a little longer

I have-it in the back of my mind that a lot of businesses
Consolidated under the CVS umbrella
That whole mess that you were making myfelt like a long day
Pull up in that Lamborghini
Pull up in that Lambo you're so worth it
Got a lot of reverb made inside me really loud
I just need to control myself and take a harder look

That prophesied death upon me
