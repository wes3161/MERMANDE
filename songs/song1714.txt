I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous home invoices leave wack real nurses bemuse

Skip the holidays, for God's sake make porridge at ham
Rest in Lil Peep's yelp
See? Of course I talk trash

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous home invoices leave wack real nurses bemuse

Skanky like lass-out skank 
Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Trashing the city at 88mph
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up
