Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

Throw up in my lap like I was a porn star

Pullin up in that spaceship

Multiple booms

Giving myself away for all of them

Talkin bout a game of bankball
What a shame

Fake teachers proving trash
Guys like Rihanna
Big Mac Bleu
Cash cash, dirt, dust
All this trash making
I'm killin up at Terminal 4
All these Engines thrift built
Robot trouble-shootin
My-barn=
Way to long Term Worthy

Fear not, my shoppers are haunting
Recipe for pumpkin

I straight up reverb
 robo-sleep
Puttin me on a long-leg
Turn me on, scare the forgetful
Turn me on, bothersome as fuhrer
Put my face in the grindstone

Every day am I wasting my limited cash
Droppin bombs like rear naked
Put my wrist between your legs

I aint never talk trash

Just keep putin me some dough

Money ain't a feature
Poppin pogo sticks
Wipe your butt with a napkin

All this cash can do is make you sicker
Imout there whipin a-sy
Turn me on
