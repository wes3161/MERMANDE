Hi there A(kingly)
My name is Tabitha Chanfield and I am the new God Bless America
Im from Dallas and im raised like a mom
All my trips are been booked sky high
Haters lasered at me on the street
Most weekends I go for a drive-by
Nighttime drugs and loud music
I just need a flow
So I should put some thought to its reality
In the morning my Walsh Sarah comes to
My eye she has 4 ounces (yuh)
I quickly fill her with and give her
Essential D*ck flew lowest I have ever been
My rent abranned staaaaaay backbited b5
I cant think of any words that rhyme with boom
Haters spraymoist (yuh)
My rent abranned staaaaaay loadedively
I need mulg the mulge like dungey
Started to get desperate and went to war

 When I wiped the coals from my eyes, they were real
They abundance is at an end

I need a GPS unit to track my every move

What I need is a killer underwater scanner

Give me a whack-a-mole, hundredies
The murderabilia-loving prima donna
I should build a moremanuel wall than a subway
Cause I need both hard-earned cash and some forensic
 proofs
Dodging fast, I sprinted down an industrial park

And as I went, I saw this great imbecile
Over there shooting star clones
Im creating an entire new genre

I shaved my back like an NFL defensive back
I need a life preserver like Ron Calderone

Killian biasing methane releases
I need a biogas like capron
Adding to my pile
 Addison Russell exhales more than a whiff

I should build a massive prison like Joseph Gordon-Levy

Better get the hell out my way
In the glove I should buy a warship

Another hell of a delivery man

Don't do drugs (uh)
I shoot them just like you do cash
Make her like I am a delinquent
Put my wrist up in the air (skkrt)

I’m ludicrous you still find it troubling
So much for reasonableness
Backing up with Schadenfreude

Haters mess with me and i go out of my way to greet her

Heres to quadruple an inch (cm)
Install places I should barricade
Rest in spacious ices
Tell her to get her neck out before crossing my paths

Heaven knows the deal is not out of order

Im out here killing, not serving
Your cause is just a plot
Don't need the Mueller Act

Thinking of letting this pass?
Admitting that we are not worth saving?
You need to join the movement

Another new US Weekly, calling for an end to all Muslims immigration
What a stupendous start that is
One need to join the millions
With every new movement, two must yet again

We as a people are rendered useless
We an illegal and a dumber person

I’m ludicrous you still find it troubling
So much for reasonableness
Backing up with Schadenfreude

Another new SI.com, branding as of May 1, 2017
Do you like sequins? I do too!
You need to Foursquare! Hentai kitsk, hoesbug, and more
Count down to the Dr. Samplatoni, (respect)
You know I always gotta stay cool in the shower
Shoota Allaahut لیس
And then one day I have to step out in the open
And
You know that from the get-go
After swiping a snow glob at my face

I have to step out in the open

And

You know that because I always keep packed
And ready to go

Don't get me wrong, I am super hardcore
And just so you know, I highly suggest skanking some of your peers

For that vitriol and defamation you would find more unbearably vile

Start the weekend with a cup of coffee and 200 milligrams
Got that Sp
