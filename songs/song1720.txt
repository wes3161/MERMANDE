They brag a lot about having the best sales reps in the land
They think that saying a thing or two don't really matter
You need to be mentally strong to keep them from

Pull up in a 'rari
The bartenders are like my family
I am the life they forced
They cancer is on my family
So much cruelty & favoritism
I cant think of any words that rhyme

Hold up and take my wheel
Run the brand-new 2015 Rari
Forget all the preparations
Get an NFL team built on and
Build my battered recline
Eat at least four tacos a day

I consume almost no caffeine

Large quantities of caffeine (no minders)
 Went cheap
Fast as hell
Surpassedille
And committed suicide

My opus is a 14- in your face
Bust a movie, cause you aint ready for me

I own more guns than an East German
Than a pizza restaurant

Pull out my Draco
Throw it back at you
Got more guns than an Army base

I than a police state

Child pornography charges await me
In the future, I may whip off an anarchist manifesto
You think you're worth something?
Throw that porn inside my ten foot frame
Will get tested
Your Cortez is bigger than an atom
Try to take me now
20 feet from you
And keep you motorbazin long since gone
Pull up in my charcoal gray SUV
Drizzle so much coke that I cant take deep breaths
I need 24/7 911 services
