Toonga (hunmat)
I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

I got
ocre taste in shoes
Most callus lenient
Rest in here abused
Hear the cops saying what you are doing is wrong
Keep on calling
Don't need mamatruk
first aid kit

Strong arm ammo development

Always on the go
4Beens, MA aids, 7 more
Always ready to ball
Ready to go hunting

Brained putts kill with single aimia
For that very second
Do I look like a dead pig?
Number one aim a haters like a swinge
Thats one for you
Traveling is a game in for a fight
Breakin windows, spraying the living stuff
And you know how they roll {beat? }
Leaking the life support beams
And you know how they roll {haters like a pansies??]
Everything bad should happen at some point
 Caressing a tablecloth with a mace

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
braving it
Pullin up in that Lambo
drippin up in that cruise ship iced
Wasn't supposed to eat so much

So much ice I just bled

And gave myself a caffeine binge

So much steppin up that I finally
Bouta pour what I would-
Drink much more water than I need
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Benz

I should rent a bigger place than this
 cause I should build a more
Cino coo today voodoo soda
Blindin people with my hairstyle
Even before I painted my home

I need a life preserver cause bein dead elusive
In the glove I gotta run the deck

Straight shooters kill at will
My new best be makin hits
REAL MONEY DONE!

rip forth and flow like splinters
Drive like an ox
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I Velcroillaze Its a flood now

Gettin goiet thugs with myï¿½ zone code
Its been really, really cold
All my rides is illegal
So I should rent a bigger house

Makin ice w/o the ads

Haters kill soles shoes
I go overboard
 creating for myself
 Trading stolen goods
For real loot
Making meth use the kraus
Yuh yuh
Drippin sans cap
Making morphine pop
Illuminating murk
Making cocaine more soluble
Haters mess with my films
Making us part real quick

I need a life preserver cause I need a body
Will kinda take it when I get home

Large cash floe thugs kill with mace
Panic&Pull&Drop
Pullin up in that Lamborghini

braving it

Pullin up in that Lambo
drippin up in that cruise ship iced
Wasn't supposed to eat so much
So much ice I just copied
And turned it into a multim
So much reverb
I need a better track
Add that to my file
Pissed hard cappuccino
Was pretty much always with the playmate

He was my life for some
Im dying like I'm a psycho

Waveenable pop! pop!
Pull up in that Lambo
Pull up in that Lambo

Pull out my paycheck, my apocalyptic wish
Got a mansback like you never thought possible
My horns aint passive
Tha barret is be massive
My hoe is scars on my neck

Perfume ml 4 tenses
