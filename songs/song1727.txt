In this martial art I live by
What I do is almost impossible
Impaired, I have only one thought
Imprison, I'll paralyse you
Even if you're already dead
Bust at your rear end, pop inside your noggin
While my men take down the perceived threat

Now I know Whoda what I need
I go where the heat is most need
The only person welcoming me on the
own deal is Hyperion

What it really like
To be
