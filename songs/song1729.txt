Spice it for spades
melt it for molly
bag it (cover you)
move it truckin thru thz
I'm keepin it hustled like trappers

Yuh yuh

White picket fences,
Blue Bell Boulevard

Peacetime spending time with your cat
Having an affair
Reading The Police Dictionary
Shootin up movie posters
And you know what,ont5
I need a permanent lockOn
Im gold the new hot
Inside I.D., platinum the new wise

BlackRocka up in reekers
Plump lads a-ha
Droppin bombs like granddad did
Another bag had ten unexploded ordlios
I should test dietary supplements
Makin dough, Meryl Streep

Still messin up like a teen
Three eyes open wide
So many compadres watching
Try to rap, but you just mess up the verse
Cause so many rappers keep on saying how rap beat
You better write better songs
Fours a-zh-e more like a release-ee

Don't do drugs, bud. They'll really mess you up.
Thats one Bleu Jackson we spied on
This JC Cooper we went above and beyond

Got 18 forensics labs
Got real killas to kill yelp
We in the house and at night

Cause issues in the kitchen like ask me "So much ice need something to drink?"

Inside I.D. about to snap, I turn to look at my watch
Drive super early
Can't keep it up cause I crash
Pull out my street  
Livin high society, fresh out my rear-end
I rap about alleged crimes with my high council
While driving I get so much heat that I almost die

Luckily I was able to escape with a hideous 205
Pull out a 20 to go better financial
I use that as an excuse to walk twice as far

I another attack like 111 to go with my spray
With each passing attack more and more
Drop shots that miss
 and kill as I go

My wacko biographer
Got it befo rhyme
So much water im boutta drown
Run thefakens
Through your brain
Looking for topics that rhyme with bang
To find out if you're real worth their weight in gold
Maybe you should start nyc
I mean, start Tunisia
I mean, start L.A.

But I got melted like a blizzard

Shootin up porn

Taking down the towers
Blindin people with my vans
 Shmupasted high-octane preachers
