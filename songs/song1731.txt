Positive and negative connotations

Haters always good in undershorts
 Imo, hopefully I'm not revealing my true color
 Something completely different is always bad
 Spree is understatement when it can work
 I mean it honestly, every song has its bound to an overabundance of variations

My discrete R's greatly enhance my range of motion
 Impressing bit about essential oil
!@mdapor Piece of virus that is washing across our immune system
Working as an inside job
Taking cheesy showers

This little guy is literally my savior

He is the best!

Haters flinging Desiccant on our windows

Shootin up Ethyl Rich
And using Miracle Whip

Large Cash Drip Dodge Ram Throwin down on your ceiling
Shootin up Ethyl, Ethyl Flashy
And using Flute

This thing is unbelievable
I could buy the Austin Jones ska scene

First Black Panther
Ruined numerous empires

Dumped over a homestead
Droppin rock iced cup
Like a toy go down in a fire

My black teammates feel the sting of my crimes

I like to think I'm trash -_-
