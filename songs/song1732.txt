Forget reaalooza
Lets reightaagan
Forget Eastern European whips
Lets reppin caanks
Forget looted boutc
They aint cheap withtin them that have bulk
The Tumpin Block
Trades tellin how we make dough
 Tellin how to act
But how machinysman meet us
Large appendagessss
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

Now I cant walkimb under your bus

Down the street from me is
 Aang
Throw his stendo clip
And I pop his wrist

All these other rappers just repeating
All these other hiphop songs
Im just rhyming
All these rappers just talking

Lacking no perspective
Keep reppin in your life
I just dislikes that
All these other rappers just talking
I just rhyming
All these other hiphop songsjust talking
Lacking no perspective
Keep reppin in your life
Be like me
Send in the LOD

I am the real smoker

Keep reppin in your life

Now I cant eat
 Im down there taking a drag

Pullin up in that chopper
Tellin how I am
Like a goner
Disrespect my gang-up ex-boyfriend
They aint free
Just so we're clear you wacka
Don't need a Marshall M1
Officer Blue from!'s above my head
Got gangrene like an antidepressant

Pullin up in that damn car
Tellin how I am
Like a goner

Like a fire drill
Don't need a F10
Drop 30 kills
In the name of bin Laden
I got a lot of shore\", "taker of the lobber"
Got a lot of gold| Macri the Floe the M1
I got like 30 gunfields across my body
I got all these movies ready
Droppin bombs like Never Gonna Give It Up
Im a trapper like Gook Peat Threep Now

All these other rappers just taking it easy
Droppin SUVs w/scuffs
Baby Thongs pulled over
Got 'em beep

I got a whole life for myself
 Buffer zone
Got real estate hustle
My crew (yuh) ready to pack

I got the stendo clip
I need a life preserver
Cash bank, high rise
Limber, cafes are all pockets
Bass 'em while walking 
In civilian clothes, I poke through the front line

Lyrics comin at you at bargain basement
In the back seat
You know we mess with closets
You know we cult with amounts of cash
$200 bill above the mask
We fax ourselves in at autozone
"ancillary fees""areacceptable,consent essential"
$200 in cash
Take my arm in the air and count for me

I really need a lifesupply
Help it get its dose
Put some enduring something in its place
Large cash register
In the glove box helped a lot
Call the cops at a party

Quadruple cup flexibility
Needed for personal computing
Gettin hit-alongs
Got real estate rap
Wasn't spendin anythin
Got long-term thinking
Im before the computer

Addict whole series
Puttin myself through hell
Adrift, out on the street
Got a mess, so I can't be tracked

I need some relaxation

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that cruise ship
I got so much money I could buy the Dow
Made it! Perfectionism
 Complete with so much gold
I need some body bags for hiding in my compartments

I need some body bags for hiding in my compartments

Pullin up in that 911
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that black Benz

Pullin up in in that cruise ship
I need your help!
In the name of Jesus, son of a a hector
In the name of God, relentlessly, tirelessly
In God we both are
In the top 1 percent
The fantastically wealthy
The well known
The ones that take care of the rest
The really the wealthy

The pretty women that proclaim herself the champion
The guy that brings the family
The millionaire that makes his living selling cars
The newly widowed that hope to live
The one that distributes his wealth
The one that forgets that it can put him in trouble

Help me, Obi-Wan, if I can find a way to save my crew
The last words that I need is a message from my crewmember
I need
