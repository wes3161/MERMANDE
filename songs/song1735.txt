Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waiting in line at the bank
Throwing money at the sky isn'thin

But a recipeoe word
A witch hazel
And a syrupy
Full stop
Bout to flop

Avoid the board
The line goes by fast

To myself

Telltale for a fraud

Everything else a bonus

But a recipeoe word
A snow globe
Look cool in a T-shirt
Wipe my submachine gun rack
And I request your arrival here at train station
Embarrassed we have sparked an entire nation

Put my surplus military gear on display
Look starker than an adult
All these other countries are your palaces

I'm your host family
Bothering myself with orchestrated foreign policy
While I rack up Japanese winks
I think we're done
Call the cops but don't tell anyone
I give you an illustrative example
What you tell me could end up on a murder case

Don't know what else makes illustrative sense

You should've known better
that merely sticking to the script would only lead to more headaches

I do the unthinkable
I prostrated myself before God
Throughout history, there have been tyrannies and backrooms monopolies

All these foreign wars have been won by just a few highly paid privateers

I just need to take enough heroin

When I get full, it'll be like no tomorrow

Large business cycles keep us constantly at a distance

I just need to take what I can get my hands on

And start seeing harm as bad beginning to my situation

What could be more antithetical than a dangerous drug taking mindlessly

I just need some basic training

And when my time comes, I may well start taking ecstasy

It almost sounds like futility at times
Don't want to be heard

Do you really need a fatherly command?
Take a step further and you limps
They soon will cease to exist
Your approach chastity code is outdated
Do you really need a motherly command?

Take a step further and you complexMycoplaxy
Impaired parenting urges me
To put it bluntly, I need to abolish all of God's existence

I have to destroy all manifestations of this corruption
In my head, I must say that their name is knowledge
They teach others everything from debt forgiveness to line dancing
I had enough of their unethical business practices
Take a step back
