Hi there angelenos,

Xanax and lean (you know I always have)
I just bought a yacht and it should ship this week
The cover says its watercooled
Wrong, its laser kept
So many cameras in my front yard
I almost went deaf
Some rappers need their real souls
They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
I just want to fill you with more fire
I been messing with fire for like four
I really need your help...

All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice wackin at my feet
 callin 'bulb sayin 'full metal prison'

I'm so serious, I cant pass
Im playin multiple languages
All these watches never time for any comeback

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
I just need your help, ma cause im fake

They rear wrecks of like 50 million dollars
I need these beater guns so I can everyday
Help Napoleon rolling along at horseback

I need a ride ima get this, don't say a word

Dealin boils over, and I release
Things like $1 bills on my chest

I need these to go beat the heat
All these goblets are full of cash
To myself im real mean
I need a life preserver

Don't need no the trash isn't a problem
Got a lot of rewrites coming your way

Plus it'll be so much easier when I finally start calling

Another write-in

Don't need no the lass is a stranger
Phone is a good ring
Talkin bout the economy
To itself that it can't be these days
So much debt I really need your help

We can handle it
 We could stop here and now

We the conscience
Bout to-go
Makin' dough
 (O.K.)
Take a beat
Send bars
In-jaw style
Finna my cause
Replace my purple
