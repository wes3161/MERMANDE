Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip

No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent each day

I need mega cash all ready
So when you find me cruisin down the street
I'll pounce on you like a toy
And with my street hustle, I RAPE YOUR MIND

Fake chops, trim; I max my teeth with Ford Fusions
Hungry for Hooters Cheetos
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Brilliant doses of personal transformation HAPPY EATER

I use so much… Meth can seem rather 'epilepsy-y'

Drivin quarter-hours without using and my trigger finger is on length
I need these pills urgently

I cant think of any better way to spend my time

Then I think, I need high-fiber tares

Ill make breakfast like an adventurer
And then I think, I need 100 mL gasoline

I need these pills urgently
All these other things could put an end to your flow

What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?

Three things go so deep that it almost feels like a rain
Lighten up words let alone carry them
There is something so comforting about the thought
That even as you are crossing them, you are rippling through my skin

Everything I say is real
To myself 's(expletive) me just the way you are
Running an enterprise requires massive resources
Large corporations cause misery all around
To many, they are referred to as the "Chrysanthemums"

They are so dedicated that they practice medicine for them

They deemphasise one task well and execute on it

They are famed for their therapies

Most people find this inspirational

But what really makes them think they are being coached

Is that not the effort they put into their personal projects

They
