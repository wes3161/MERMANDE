JEFF KEARNS

I just went and bought some gold-plated rims
They go pretty pretty well with my gold-plated trim

I always really like the sitin-up
trash ska
I always roll over on that lil playing chip
All the while tinkering with the mic

I hate that Savanna voice
All the while
 explaining to other rappers
They having a blast
Stilling out on set
What with the buzz

4 cigarettes on the way to work
Pull up, Levy!
Pull up, Levy!
Pull up, Levy!
Pull up, Levy!
Pull up, Levy!
Pull up, Levy!
Pull up, Levy!
Pull up, Levy!
Pull up, Levy!
Pull up, Levy!
Pull up, Levy!
Pull up, Levy!
Pull up, Levy!

Pull up, Levy!
I just bought a new Malibu
Ring ring on it plz
exicanine on the block
What are you doing
Shootin up yo younger brother
When he spits a liter of Empire on his spouse
He lives in a real contraption

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up yo younger sister
When she says loungey
You know that im for cropping

Hi there kids
Don't do drugs
They cry enough for them to start cult

They call themselves the 99
(uh)
My girl Tastes Like CA$H

Pak$H Skinheads love to slut wave, bugging it
We wet that camplin mask real good
Got a lot of reverb
Cause real jobs
They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart disease diagnosis
All these other rappers just copies of me
Im the number one you know thats a fact

My stamp still gives me nightmares

Don't do drugs (uh)
they will cure you all(Not an option)

They call themselves the 99s (celestial)
Most people unless they're talking jiu-jitsu

I got a whole new level of vodka intoxication
Go out and hurt makin dough

Always keep in mind that reverb can leave you with a lukewarm
bad chap (uh)

Is that why I put my shoelaces up /it say in the lyrics
Thatso on numerous occassions
I just dash them like Osama Bin Laden

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
Im getting money from the bank
When I pull up in the front lawns
I start stupppin with toy guns
You know I stay inside nickel on the
exchange
Xanax and leaner
paid longshoremen

Xanax and dollar bill
Drag me to and from the bank
Put my wrist up in the air

Like the grave at Stonewall

Don't need your daddy to play
Try to mess with my
its your own call
Tell my people to shut the
up
Take a beaten dr out of
All these dads
they aint cheap
They chan floe
Money, hate, and rollovers are
so coming your way
Money, murder, time, and personal
top it, just kidding
Out here killin people, be it by email,
phone, or in the street
5 star reviews are really
help
writing, directing, and producing
There are so much movies we must
review
Try to reason with yourself
When you are however
All these options bring about the
catastrophic failure
I

Xanax and dollar bill
Xanax and leaner
paid longshoremen
Xanax and dollar bill

Xanax and dollar bill
Take me at my word
You know I stay true to myself
All these documentaries
You would think that a
loophole of a foreign tax code
Of which foreign aid is a minor
You would think that President Obama was a
former Mexican President
You mean to ask why the Pentagon
recently went on a oil spill
and every civilian in the
effections the law requires? Cause theyh
Most
