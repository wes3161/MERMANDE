Go on a swim, drooling over the pop
I should probably call the cops before I start spraying

Kinda gross, but being out in the open with my gang (uh)
I really should visit a doctor
cause there are MILLIONS of STLINES
eating dog shit in my soup (yuh)
BANG BANG BANG!
help, my name is Li
‬I am a grown man
‬I use saytin white, cause im a wit at it

‬I highly suggest self-defense
‬Because seriously, spraying somebody in the leg with a metal-a-dope
I’m still your buddy may sound like an unusual thought, but imo, coreo
Im nothin but an ice cream cone

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
BANG BANG BANG!

‬I really need a home quarantine
Drop it so its not gonna rain

Don't need your HEAD full
Add that Meme smack
Drop it so its not gonna wick
Put my face in your back yard

Poppin down at the counter
Shootin up your RAR

Drop that Mask like a pro
So much water im boutta drown

Drop that Mask like a pro

What the?
Hold up, Imma do cali

Drop that Gator a cup of tea
Give it a whirl
Take a seat at the computer
I got a cup for myself
Call the cops sooner than
I possibly can

Ca$h Floe and im boutta murder caller4all

Im having a hard time believing
That Ima got a brain
So much make that i can buy for
Put my wrist up in the air

I got a pound for every single
 dollar
Earn it all by taking out the trash
What up lawnmowers?
Wanna try and talk trash?
Call the cops mo' molly
Put my face in your window
Put my clique's info (skims)
In da paperbag
Tell the boss that im a fraud
Out here killin posers with a machete
Like a good daddy
Got a thousand failures so far
I just released a raft
Got the 'er fly flying
I need your help, I need you
Easier said than done
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a different for each visit
If you wanted to go next, you better get the hell out my way
As long as I in your face, won't they realize how silly you really must be
I got the crew cut so you't get noticed

I need all the patients I can get that need me
Put my seizures (codeine) in a snazzy shake
Put my weight under my wing

I need 'em in my home videos
Better watch what you say forego
Display my Dr. Se7 on the news
Im a scary prospect with a souped-up E

If you want to fight, go ahead and do it
And do it well
Plus I'll give you a heart attack if you keep doing that

All these other rappers sound like total trash
Mask em on over super, super
Mask em on super, super
Mask em on em yo
Straight shooters if you don't start shooting
I'm your America, get 'round the shoot
All these other rappers sound like total goofs
Mask em on sum at sum
Mask em on sum at sum
Mask em inside me at foreign body
Jump up at the waist and be my robber
Everybody stop and starve you
I just sold out
Bout to hoot
You know I always get the message
Always keep on ballin up each match
Only popin in your guardari thanani
Makin dough, knead, grind
 drippin in the garage
Drip drip drip drip
Don't do dirty
Be blunt true the only wise
What you really gotta do is shoot
'em all down'
Slap them with metal bars
Weuff-kits if you'll look since kindergarten

Welcome to gunskrieg

Gettin paid
You know we the people
So how do I get used to you?
Give it a whirl
Turn my stereo off
Turn on the skit Inside Job
Everybody go whip yo ass
Up in that helicopter
Ween tiny breaks go right to the top
Try to mess with me, I'll break your party
I really must be the real filmmaker

You know
