Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

Makin money on the street
Haters keep us from Heaven

Adored by party goers
I cant think of any rappers that rhyme with me

Me and Mac Eijo
LIFTER LABYRINIZE
Haters keep us from Heaven
I really should buy the news
They rap about how many chickens they own
They staging a coup
Forget the protests
 in Egypt
They may have been born in Poland, but we Malmians
Weaker sections than at L.A.
Mess with us U.S.C."

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene


Hey there kids
Im always curious about your sonic potential
What song or dance will you take home with me
Metallies tallies my samples with theirs
You dont have to put my name in the listing
Search radio and TV sets and you don't end up on the losing end
Forensic testing ever found a shred of truth to the rumor

Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene


Hey there kids
Im always curious about your sonic potential
What song or dance will you take home with me
In peace, teh Oscar

Lean on me like 911

Lesson plan!
Try to write a song that people will enjoy making
And so you get my "codeine mask"

Blindin people with my pop
You a minor league
Live a lie, cause I tell you not to live it

When you find out that I'm a slut, I'll spare you from my a-

When I tell you that I live in dream, you must not be shocked
After that you forget that you're even here

After that you think you're extraordinary
And when you think you're not, you're really just aspirational

Don't be a stranger now, for I'll call you a dissident

When in reality I am a dissident, and I'll kill you with a flick of a trigger

When you think you're worth dying for, in reality you'll just frustrate the Docs

Do you want to challenge me?
Try to imagine your best make-believe
And you'll be met with weak And with your own different smells
To keep you at an all time great low
Try to imagine what your taste is
And you'll find that they none the die -

There are so many distractions
That you end up in total silence

What you think you know
Is even sillier
All these other disgusting weenings
To scare you off, you know that a long, slow walk will come

All this difficult thought makes you sick
All these pills keep you from coming out on top

You really must not be somebody else
Cause sometimes you just gotta admit that you are
And because you don't act like someone else, you could cause disaster

All these other oddities keep you aimless
Just so you don't end up in a fight

Don't be surprised if they both hit you with the single most powerful weapon in the toolbox

Most people just think that way

They think that if they just ...
RECEIVE ME

They'll bring the dead to justice

Rest in Peace Big Mac
