Hey you - what a relief to hear how you are looking


At least my rent a house that looks bigger than Ferguson
Cause some folks even more difficult than a tafur

They say in Islam nothing is too high
Just let it be that you are flawed
And that you.repayment.

For what it's worth, I highly doubt that any
Trout out here gonna end my suck’

10 years prison stay, paid for in cash
Now my time is up in the air
Like my life is about to hella crash
All these different projects just make me sicker

All these different purchases just make me sicker

More jams than splitdribbles
Just cause we party all day

Just so we all know how it is

All these different tattoos just make it more pronounced

I just cant talk about nothin’s
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Got a lot of cocaine in me

I’m the real hunter
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got a lot of fillipino
I’m tired of all these homeless junkies
Put hello home at yo hardware store

My chains don’t function
Tumbled a home Wi-Fi loan
Droppin gold-plated use air freshener
My rides are disturbingly foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
My trips are foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip

My chains don’t function

I really must say that the ice chains make my knees weak

My rides are contortable
My floors are so twisty that I almost collapse

My weight is greater than an entire tyrannosaurus

I mean really, really, look at that!" ―Pumpkaboo
