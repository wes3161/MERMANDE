Plus you could never win
High school would be like a mountainset

Iridium a T

Cholesterol a triple!
Proteins my pant bill

Holodeck trauma victims are sentenced to years in prison

Lived under five different names
Admitted to many unethical and harmful acts
I was only a minor
Lobbying in foreign countries made me sick
In prison, I crossed a line
Only by cooperating can I be put to sleep

Do you really think that because I live here that I should stay in prison?
No?
Don't know what else makes deeply troubled prisoners tick
They finally come to terms with their true nature
They no longer give a fuck what anybody thinks
They just need closure!

Do you even know what im talking about?

While I support the President's criminal action to combat illegal immigration, we must not miss the opportunity to put an end to this scourge, known as gang warfare

I encourage all gang members to leave the United States, for fear that they might bring about peace and harmony

As I say nothing, I tell my people to stay home and watch

If there is a war today, I'll bring the dead the following day
If there's a war tomorrow, I'll bring the dead the next day
