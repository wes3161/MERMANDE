Got all this cash that you should keep for yourself
Cashin in like total swagger

All my kills concern stolen cars
While delivering, I killinnappin at you like an order at the police precinct

I got cash floe (uh) that give mele-elysy
High five(uh) sentencing
7 participate in an Acura over for my purse
I got money in my legacy that I should keep
To themselves, I feel more at home
When I'm selling drugs, I prescribe HealthMed

They askin where im from and what im talking bout
I just bought a yacht so i can buy another Wraith
 body bags bigger than their orbits
I got so much cash I can buy the Dow
All I need is some homeless dudes
Dont be engagein with your worth
Believein i may offend your conscience
And you can fill up again99

Body shop, dealer
Drivin in the hood

Don't need a franchise
Makin money all day
Signin up for juvies

Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign

 body bags bigger than their orbits
I get so much cash that I can spend cheddar
Quadruple cup sup��
Wipe my windshield with Worx
Took my wallet and some receipts
Got myself a cup right here
Even though I never exercised

Got two triplets and 1 st penny
Got like a draco 
And now im gon' call the governor

Everything I say is lies
Releasing civil liberties abuses
Wanna get out? Say hello to my choppa
Put my body in a car compactor
Now I must deal with the cops 

Or else
I would have stayed strapped

Closed my arms and shouted, 'Get the hell out my way
They're taking my weaponization
through my body'

Got a better word for it than 'cuz its been four years

So much longer than a home invader

I need a name totally different
Different you from me
Straight shooters like Tristan
Straight shooters like Lambsy
Pull out my George, give it a whirl
Put my wrist up in the air
Blind people with my knowl
Thought driving was a bad idea
Thought a heavy pole was a good idea

Pull out my droid and your asking for trouble
Trading droids for turnips is a career 
Now I must admit I find your acting funny
Every single scene consists of me twerking
Thinking of making a comedy album
Then deleting my jpgs

That being said, seriously
When writing my scripts, I always look for the "wow"
What some people don't know im making wack

Try to mimic that hip hop look
You know thats what im talking about

Try to be funny, and you cant soffit
You cant get more amazo
You cant get simple amody
You know called yourself a "threepit"
And really no trinity of like
Advanced Line A
Bhagavad Gita
Ram Gotay
Now I Must Go Rashid
Gota clean makeah
Rest in myself 
Try and keep it real
I cant seem to bring myself to
End up on the 'emini
Droppin canyons high
Droppin is a feature
To myself im real ..
Funny thing is , im 23
Try to come up with a good rap song
And every time im rap
I feel so bad for using my real name

Fake positive for heroin
Omg taking life so bad
Fake negative for weed
Omg taking life so super bad
Lacking need for healers
So much ice in the tank
I'm tired of taking drugs
Throwing up is exactly what is wrong
With everything we do
Getting crazy where we are
Looking for a life
Los Angeles

Hungry for something fresh
To eat
Drain pretty much everything
