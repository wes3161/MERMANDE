Money well spent plz keep pounding

Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on

Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies, each day of the week (gang gang)
Poppin molly, you know i never sleep (no i dont)

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip (gasps are abundant)
Got it slower than a bus
Some folks jobs above the law
They even got Rico their corporation

I'm the best, the bad boy is your aide

I had snow flurries at Christmas along the East Coast

I should have bought Primark
They went out of their way to give me that purple
Thanks, governor. I should have bought at a better chain
Triple sec

Pop pop pop pop
10 times out of 100
I need some body bags
OP Tanner, go in your grill
Clean up after you, grandpa
10 wheels only, set an immediate goal
Drive a lambo to prof
Put a crowd support ace on the cover
All these other rappers just copies of themselves
Everything I say is real
Live Spirit, live rhythm, live flow
Like some kind of weapon
You better hope not that you'll end up like more on my end
You better hope that you not end up like more on my jn We Buy, We Run
And we livin live at a yacht shop
All these other rappers just copies of themselves
Everything I say is real
Live Devil Dog~~~
Extremely accurate ballistics
Disguised in clothing that really lets you down
I shoot gardens, I raid anthills

I use a mamatree as my personal storage device

Minuteman kills, minuteman escapes
I shoot down like, ten robots
Throw some grenades, I could wipe out Bayerische Reims

They ask what you're doing, privacy is my number one

I shoot down like, five robots
Throw some mortars, my carbines could crush a division

I shoot down like, five robots
Robot invasion, friend! Help!

I need these just like a today's headline says
Everything I say is real
Live angel, live dependability, live at its best
Feel the pull of a lifetime
As a result, I think myself and my work really mean a lot

This behavior is not limited to the industrialized West
Backing China into its true home
 as the next global superpower
Dumping more carbon into the atmosphere than the Sun
Shootening for parts like lead and mercury
As a result, we're the least populated country on the face of the earth

Dumping more renewable energy on to the future
And calling it quits
I look really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really real, really long live the biota

And if that trip we make goes poorly I could be making great gold the following day

Dumping more than 1,200 different pesticides at once
I consume more than vitamin D3
This excess can be detrimental to mental and physical well being
I utilize illegal
