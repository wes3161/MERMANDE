Livin high society
To myself im real mean
Lifestyle is insane
Drug use, alcohol abuse
My clients price our planet 13 times more than their own government
We must pull together and stop this slaughter

I have no morals, and I will not serve anyone
Live a free life, clean the house faster

I have already lied, and much, much longer
I need a head start
Start praying, and you shall be made whole

Then I will bring dark magic to your nightmares

When I feel like crossing a ceiling
Pull up, and im sure you're not hitting the 2nd
I will drain your of justice, socialism
Like so much blood your being intended for
Such a calamity is looming over the entire world


I have already paid dearly for your dream, my cause is too great

Therefore, whenever you some day pop the B:line source code

This message may taken as true
That entire web of relationships
Is a fraud

Send 100 wet dreams -- AND you're guaranteed a hundred wet woks

Film you herero
All these other addicting films
I just got rid of 'em
All these clever poisons they (I) have
Embark on grocery shopping expeditions (Go in Chevelles)

I gotta give 'em credit - for plump, lean

In the mail I'll generate at least 15%
This will really mean a lot to you

Brush her ear for air flow issues

They expect really good things from you
But nothing compares to what she's capable of
With her own kind heart she can bring Sayre to justice

Resturant guy messes with my bucolic lifestyle
Thats one for the f[ck]t up
Works fine with me vouchsafed

Lets get this over with, because some people are gonna like what they see
the inside line a beat
So much for 'em.

Thats one thing yours is naught to mess with
Don't hear us
Take a moment
To ourselves"

That was some pretty ugly stuff

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Shootin up consciousness
Breaking into different stores
Using a trusty semi
Pull up in that Lamborghini
Pull up in that Lambo
Pull up in that black Benz
Pull up in in that white Ghost

Pull up in that cruise ship
So much for having fun
Try to picture your town filled with life

When you're so far removed
From your daily routine
That you almost start to fear
Quit looking at your monitor

Quit asking a question
And instead be a good guy

I am The Gambino
