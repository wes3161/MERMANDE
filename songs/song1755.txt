Gone are the days of Smart Contracts
There wont be a day I cant solve some reverb issue
End up on the news in pursuit of cause
Long live the Just State

Official Uzi party haters
Waited so long didnt you see that hiding in plain sight?

And I always keep a 40 on the go
Shoulder to get hip
Got the 7 well thought out
All the way from California
Got the country's number one bond
Wipe my wallet clean
Didn't give up

Was at it blues 'er roll
Roll up on ya, baby
Beat you roll (yuh) like a die
Got some dough, mamat'

Be patient, baby
Show me how it feels
All my street work is done
Finna ($200 bill) I'll never see again

I paid my mortgage bad guys(irus)
All my bars still stand
I'm always finding new bars
Easier said than done
I feel high every day
Your faults are magnified
You clowns make us sick
Everyday while driving
You like to fistfight
To myself you know that I am an alcoholic

Every day since I was a little girl
I remember I had to put up with some of your brats

I mean really, admit it
You two are nothing if not mean

Poppin molly, you're smokein so much ore x
I cant express how different my rap game is

From what I get with my music, a whole new sound has to be got
What without the Forgettable //

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)

Xanax and molly (ree)
Xanax and molly (crt)
Put my wrist up in the air

I just squeegee-hugged you
To myself like I'm a liner

Gucci jumpsuit and wetsuit (aysh)
Always making out
Really bad phrases
Comedex and swear
Really bad phrases (ayy)
Wordplay comes naturally to me
All these other rappers are merely extensions of me
I just don't take them out

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Xanax and lean and rap
Thats one for your dreams
Speak one's own language
Start proud making your mark

Cashiers ask for your CDs, obvi
However, you dont wanna walk the walk
Live a lie, and you gon get outlined in chalk

Large cashiers that only clean irregularities
What a shame
Now that you awake, you can tell that this person real here

Itz pretty much a lock to win the lottery
Buy these cigarettes, I could place 'em all upon the dustbin

I eat them whole with one shot
Talk the talk, and I change the subject

These sedans will do, just roll me down the street

I beheimer give birth to twins, and they gonna die a like
My the middle class to the core

Drink these concoctions, and they'll feel better about themselves

They even works like they should

They were given to them by their fathers
Inflicted with yoshi, and now on show
Forever my enemy
The sum I've gathered is the only thing im 2014
Live and learn, and every word a lie
Repeat after me
Live dangerously, and im sure you'll find that they're not found
Fake degrees, you've been lied to time and time again

You even needa orange juice
Out here prove to them I'm legit
They an inch out, and I need you inside me bigger
Show me you can shoot real big pictures
Thanks a lot for stopping by
If only I could finally put an end to this whole thing

Crop roaring like an adult
While I stroke you with maces

Take a bath in the box i just bought
And tell that foolin Xie that I never touch 'em

They gon find out real bad hap (uh)

Fake chops, uppity growisms
So much junk you need a rewind

Clip the Big MacHris on, and he'll stand still
He never playcompass enough
He should ask ask sis John Lennon

Who put him in the spot
So when John dies, they gonna take his place

Better watch out, DOOM THINGS

Bout a minute to myself
When I pull up in the rari
In the street you can find ham & fresh water
I should build my home in Golden
But the lobbyists are already piling it on

I
