Just something to motivate
To another thang

So much ice you almost slip
Droppin on the brake lines
Pull down the backseat
And snap

Pull up, snap down shoot
Pull up, snap down bust (an)
Pull up, snap down slide (slide)
Don't worry, I wont' mess with you
All my rides is zone by zone (zoning)
