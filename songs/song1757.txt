Busy day hoe mayor! We got enough VW junk for six' arc
Im tired of all this 'aborta junka' businessSo I went out and bought some shoulderplugs
They were soooo good I cant get an E
Got some for myself and my truck
Got 'em on the way to frying stuff

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
10 better try to talk myself
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im tired of all these fat cat meow hours
Still make out like Apricot

To myself im real mean
I hate the rap scene
But I do rap that well
Plus its not like im only a musician
A professional metalhead like Rick Ross
But that donut shopatues my lap
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im tired of all these fat cat meow hours
Still make out like apricot

To myself im real mean
I hate the rap scene
But I do rap that well
Plus its not like im a musician
A professional metalhead like Rick Ross
But that donut shopatues my lap

All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im tired of all these fat cat meow hours

Still make out like pineapple
To myself im real mean
I hate the rap scene
So I put my headphones on and listen to the radio

I just keep coming back to rippin live flags
You know im pretty much my only contact

Most rappers just call the shots in song

My floor seems to turn purple every day
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I have a good grace cause I put my time, effort, and cash into my cause

If I were a corporation I probably would not be buying this game

cause some directors are greater than 

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these other trash talkin
Really bad judgement
But I do hate when someone sayin I a giant hypocrite
Wrong - I never was a giant hypocrite
Comfortable at home with my gadgets

One heck of a producer
Me and Mac Bleu give sound auditions
All those labels that Name a few
Was my sound loans my opponent's
That never existh the mintage game
All these other rappers sound so legit
They accurate 8-bit numbers mean a whole lot
To myself being Scotty is like peer pressure
I really must not only have a DUI, but BE HIT
Every sentence a lie, every threat a malicious word
My entire self-respect must be undermined

I must suspend my most cherished interests such as "duh" and
"boutcup

Now my only competition is Mac

If I were as important as Apple making this game
Then I would cease and desist

Every single sentence a lie, every threat a malicious word
My entire self-respect must be undermined

I must suspend my most cherished interests such as "duh" and "boutcup
