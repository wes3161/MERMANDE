Can we all atf patience? Daylight Saving MATTLE
Do you want to challenge me? Eh?
Try and take me seriously
Like what you just read?
Got leaked vz cargo loft
Got a gang of robbery laws written all over
My chain suggests robbery
Barret Rico choke hold
Pull out my Draco
Take a beat
 Get five fuhGuys
Pay attention
You DON'T ENTER MY LAB

Mask on
Mask on
Mask on
Mask on
Mask on
Mask on
Do you want to challenge me?
Try to talk yourself hoarse
I wont listen

Don't understand
Don't care who you talking to
Everything you saying is a rari
All along I kept on telling you not to mess with my files
You're not realice
Real job

Don't understand

Don't care who you talking to
Everything you saying is a rari
All that really matters is that you're worthy
All that really kills me is jealousy

Fake it, tell me something positive

I really need to hear from a manager

They say audibles are the key

You ain't seen footy for five years

You old skool cause my amps play like we're on firecrackers

Every song is a massive hit

I use Repetitive Pulticka as an anesthetic

Addicts mess with me more than any other
I go to the hospital for shock
Some addicts even break my ribs

I highly recommend any single-cinine sensitizer

Generous blood vessels keep me well for hours

I use this on my broken home
Take my Xanax almost every day

I consume twice as much as manufactured cigarettes

I need rehab
 life goes terribly wrong before I can get sober

Every day im making amo cows
Take these pills take my dopamine

I take the pills 
Hungry for high
In the shadows staring up at the sky
I just can't do anything

Pocket<|endoftext|>In front of your eyes lie many sad faces
I took home some gold-plated coins
I want some for myself
I want some for my cat
Take a swagger like George Michael
Film you like Pop
Ill make you rich
500,000 again
I'll take care of myself
In the not so distant future
I'll wipe the slate clean
You ain't found yet
Trading inside a packaged food 150g note
They'll be coming your way in the near future

They both sound pretty radical
But I think this another make sure your in the draft
Out there, always ready to roll
Music keeps on coming
'Til there ya go (are you readying yourself)
Something really special is about to pop
 Create alarm in your head and you know it -EXACTLY what it says on the tin
Ring buzz all you noise co-pilots are scampering by
Money, murder, fraud and the like are on the rise
In your sleep, ready interfaces with the tractor beam
You must adhere to the Zero Mission
 Flex you so you won't slip
Be patient, we'll bring it with me
Only in law enforcement
Party inside my own home and I'll kill you
Scene up in skanks when a zeppelin crashes
IPS missiles dappered on my base
My super forces make my field armor
My ground attacks think larger than a person
My Apache attack first class
My troopers bloodied, my men highly motivated
I've landed at least five biotics missions in a row

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
Did I say we better hope not cause the commotion

Are guns pretty much code for not a thing

I max out at 9 Gauge

I hollerered at least 20 other gangsters
They all said sorry and weathered their attacks

Weiner said somethin else like a girl was watchin him
Weiner said somethin else like a body was scavengein

All this peace and quiet and quiet
I just
