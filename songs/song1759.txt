Show me how wrong you are that you think I have some
Don't know what else is foreign
Shootas in the mail, writing checks
At home I mean it!
I mean it like 7 feet from my face

Put my iPod in the glove compartment
And I'm off to a good start
End up on the news, gossiping

All these cool hiphop memes
I should've known better
That being fraud heaven
They would've made a fine movie
Better late than never
Better hit the streets asking to fight

They steal your voice, my secrets

With eye contact I can almost make out
