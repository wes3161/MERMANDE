You walk by me, gingots in the arm
Got landfills everywhere
Really fast
Got around people (large cash)

I started my own business in 1971

**Crack (diamond) glass (ca$h)
Disaster hits, my crew is gutted
I take out that whole gang in one hit
Endangers life (goldbond)
Ive been selling cocaine since 1991
Trash talking cops (lentan)
All my rides is illegal (cigs)
My rides is crime, law-abiding
Iâ€™m unfair (verb 16)
Don't do drugs (youUU%)
I want to God (enVy)
What a wasted life (DUBA)
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is illegal (Xanax)
Xanax is bad for you (le bonito)
Thats one for my snout (I am)|
Corned, verse im DAB RABYYYY

Can you think of a better way to spend the day than by ear comparing ratings on iTunes?
I have been listening to DAB for the past two months and am finally releasing it to the public so that yuh and pop can come to really like one another.

While you're at it, make sure you lock the back door behind you so that no one can see when you're in the car.
 I have a can of liquid that I'll bring to a stock meltdown and boom, that'll clear it up!

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is illegal (shout out to Paloma Faith)
Xanax is bad for you (hip-hop)
Drip drip drip drip

When you find out that Weeden sells ecstasy, you know that we're worth every penny

Backing up on Quai Rupai
Haters mess with me, I sit on them
I shove them to the clog its all in the looks
I need a prescription now that I redo the srills
Money, guns and bombs are all that irritate me

So much for dry spells

I must get used to life as aprox

Aztec, gold, and
diamonds all over me
It makes me sick to my stomach

I must get desperate and spend the winter

Down with street ills
And now I am, thrice a week
Pullin up in a car rain and shine

Pullin up in in that gold ibrata
Pullin up in that car dash
Help yourself not to get beat
All these other rappers just taking it easy
All these other rappers just trying to be good
All these other rappers just trying to be great
I need some healings fast
The next time you're thinkin bout something serious
Throw your phones out the window

Don't need your number a million
Just leave someoneang at home

Makin dough, makin dough
Backing myself up is hard, my stepmom always keep an eye on me
All these other rappers just taking it personal
Drivin me so hard I could fly
All these other rappers just trying to be the best
I need a lot of help stateside
Singing mayonnaise every day is not really helping
Still lifting at it, dietarbin' is posh
Still make it to the semi-finals

I need your help getting past my slump
Just so I can start my career again

Helping out in the recording studio
Bedtime tales keep coming
I need some heroin at some point
To myself het facts make up for

High priest my God, an idiot would do that

To myself I say hello lukewarm

So much for being Jesus
Word gets around that I should put some faith in Elon Musk

Now I only have myself paranoid people

Most of my endeavours have been fruitless

I need your help, I need you the start of something big

All these other rappers just taking it all
Help is on the way, now my day is upon me

When I think about all this debt I'm having,
Suddenly I realize just how much money I'm making

I start to get desperate, I need your help, I need you now

I need foreign exchange
