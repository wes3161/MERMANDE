They say the right mom says the left...
Trash talking my clique is like the lowest
, best and only fly with me
All the while you on the inside are making out
Really bad grammar
All these swear words just keep on coming

Don't know what else rhymes with trash
No one knows rhymes with hate

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Gucci bursting at the seams
Out here please
Drop 40 cash (dollar)
My Brother Ca$h Floe isburrowin

What a difference a day makes

Droppin bombs like Grills of Rock (Rock)
BANG BANG BANG (Chili)

Stereophonic weenies rhyme
High Fives, Harlots, Spouses
Shootas while my CVS is up (COUGH)

I pop your hair out like an answer
Disruption is coming (drip)
I'm the real deal

Party's on with the rest: private jets, heroin
Your party is with a bunch of my closest circle
And my closest circle is your crew-cut
Your crew-cut is the loudest
You'll never hear me
 from my gang-outhouses

You'll never hear me from my crew
Blindin people with my rims
They callin the cops but you know that im stillin with my crew

You knowin cause I get paid
1 in the currency da heaven
Dont ask me where im from

Me and Mos Def
Dawgs BIG duh
ganglionic (yuh)

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Kill him with mace like im Stone Temple Pilots
Or we're gonna end up like a hundred other crush teams in a comin street

BANG-BANG-BANG! (get out of my way)
aren't all the guards Force Sonic make
Even in my sleep I keep telling you never beat the CVS

Don't do window slams cause I stay inside
Tipin my purse so I don't get strip-searched
Plus I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life
