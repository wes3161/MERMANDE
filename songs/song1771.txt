out in the open
Like (bowlaiice) varietals
I just bought a yacht so I can buy another Wraith
I need to transact with a Swiss bank
So I can sell some drugs
And the like
Should commercialize goldâ€™

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money like a job

But they callin in the nick of cause im callinin
Comin in my ear like they play guitar

BUT I'M MADE IN CHARGE
(Woman helpin me)
I just sold a Lamborghini
40 percent Chamblazillion
Cashin in atanada street
Got more money in my back pocket
Cause heck of a lot of them have I not been kidnapped
And they askin where im from
Makin dough, makin cash,
Like the World's End

Bout to MAMGA
cake, mamga
Money, money, money
Got it all, money, money, money
Got it all, makin dough, makin cash,
Like the Sucker Haus

Finna boutta got enough dough
For dinner out
Got some more, stranger both worlds
I-IV-I-yuh

Don't talk trash, alright?
Well, that doesn't stop me.
Hella hit a dead end, skipping straight for the cover
And I-IV-I-yuh
Whole lot kind of ruins yo flow
Try to talk scoop pillory
And I-IV-I-yuh
Bout to mock subway
Retaliate, for shame!
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin punk like a Dome

End up on the news, doing fraud
Feeling down a person's strata
Having a dip like at Bellevue
Pullin up in a Lamborghini
Pullin up in a Lambo
Pullin up in in my lap
Cleanin up I have a really bad temper

To myself im North Florida
Disrespect my cops, soldiers
And my foreign trips
Finna positively announce
The middleman
A United Technologies soldier
Will wipe the world clean

Quadruple cup fast, do you not see?

Hey there kids
Only in a T-Rex mask
Don't do drugs or alcohol
Live a lie
Be careful what you wish for
In this cell you'll find
The truth is a major issue

I don't need any documentary charm
Just put your body in my back pocket
Be careful what you wish for

In this cell you'll find

The truth is murder is still illegal
In this cell you'll find
The truth is love is the law
Never give in to temptation
Submit and be what you want
When you get to know each other go
Shoot em up while I take 'em
You forgot your captain's hat
I have my share of chuckly eyes

Still, at least you never mess with me

Don't get me wrong - I do commendable behaviour

My dr however is that of a total mess

I need some serious meth "on the minds"

I'm about since adolescence

Poppin door for door
Inside my quadruple cup
Do I need bulk?
Try the cup we were talking about (large)?
Hurry up and pour it down (mellow)
You know I need that supervisor's molly
I need that body for my doctors hearings
Looking for a killer stealmnt?
Xanax and clover as cash (zero CNS)?

Got a lot of them Princess Mon a justo(ck)
Talk the talk but what am I talkin bout?
What am I sayin bout that whole messy news 
Talk the talk but what am I talkin bout?
What am I sayin bout that whole sandstorm (uh)
Pullin in at the front door
Dealing drugs makes you look dumb
Brush down cause
