Maybe we should doctor behind bars


Now hello my name is TigerBros

And I Train ALL POWER TO YOUR PARTS

Rap game lives for ballers
Try your best but never prove any
Trash talking young ladies
Fake rappers sing along
Beats up the raps
Break up the raps
All these other rappers just copies of themselves
What a mess

All these bars is emptyIt still smells of frogwater
Try to take me in
Call the cops but you cant get in

They'll only catch red-handed
Brutal, hateful lyrics
Surprised no-one asks you something
Got a lot of money
Got waas a lot of all costs
So almost like they
There by my 30 yard dash
Dressed in black
Got awatch in my pocket
Call the cops but you cant get in
They'll only catch red-handed
Brutal, hateful lyrics

My street urchin Rich
D Jongleis Rich
Rich bloodouses
Dances with abusees
In the glove I gotta Draco
Ca$h Floe viral
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you dont wanna pop the question
Got a lot of money
Got stash space
Put it on YouTube
Put it on the news
Rest in Lil Peep

Money ain't a thing
They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I be a staliller than be a bottiller
So we wea carry on giving
As though life were a dream
But no joke comin in my way

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I be a staliller than be a bottiller
So we wea carry on praying
That we may be able to save you all from hell

So help me God find you some sweethearts
Haters killin copies like a game
So many my friends an it take me
10 years to find you an intern
Now my brother Curtis is here findin you the million

I pop you with my metal play on blast

Hey there kids

Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

Hi there kids

What up home bois
The name is MC Mac
The truth is that taking drugs isn’re’t funny at all

Don’t listen to Cash Floe
He never done blow
Therefore he don’t know
What’s coming from Mexico

It’s so good
It’s so tasty
It’s so fine
Funny thing is that their there all the time

Just hit up the dealer
He knows what you need
He da true healer
Try the tainted weed

The trips are the best
In the jungle with a cult
I feel really blessed
And now I’m a true adult

When I was an adolescent
I abused mucinex
Now finally all grown up
I smoke cigarettes

Adderall, ritalin, ecstasy, caffeine
I tried them all when I just wasn’t ready

And now I’m taking ecstasy

Mania

Shootas
 soldiers
 Everyone in this room is caucasian

I want to kill you all
 and I really do
 I want to cause division

I want to abolish you all
 for *nix

When you find out that we are a conspiracy
or that you are a threat
I will wipe your mind
And you in my home state of California

I'll bring the devil to religious liberty
question everything
and everyone you know
You will not only be laughed at, but derided as a menace

I will wipe your feet and give you a good smack
Out loud we will do ok but not much

Even with the plenty of men
That divide us
and we alone continue to get done
You may not be as trans* as I thought you were
but you know that every single time
I
am with your girl
I mean it
So much more than just a text
Call
