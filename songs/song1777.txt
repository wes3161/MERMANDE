Haters fakers
Lyrics lean towards camp
Trash talking college kids
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?

Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flexibule
Try to mess with me
Drop you with the stendo clip
End up on the news, addressing you directly
Your email addresses, calls, texts are ALL COMMANDER
All my trips are mapped legit
Complete the purchasing
So I can build a bigger home,
I need as many watches as possible

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
Drop you with the stendo bag

Loosen you sooner than that
Don't know what else rhyme or reason should
Me and Samantha Wolf
I roll down my window net and rap
I pop you with my rap shoes
We been callin skyhooks, calling doorbell

Helpin cause purple to wane

Some people functions as 1
So if you hypoglycaic break something
Take a pill and you should be fine
Workin like pasakal
I got a lot of platinum plated streaks
On my wrist is a fake blade
Got codeine on it

Lived inside a mansion for 38 years

My Echo Must Not Be Walking

Sumer Is Raging Bull Spurbo

I just bought a yacht
The John Wayne of luxury
I could build a whole new Manhattan
Looking to take on the criminals
I'm gonna take as many lobster as I possibly can
Breakout Sure Computer
If I can only get to $5
What would you do if you had to walk in my shoes?
I Have a Purpose

Win or lose, make me a better hacker

Bass pro means impede
When you have to listen to me
You better barricade your windows before I start spraying

I have a rule, and a minuscule percentage
You better barricade your closets before I start spraying

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Lips of the flowers filter through your skin
I use a semivodal cannabidoma
And each time anmg-taat
I just pop the cap inside my vent
Always keep an open mind
Check in with the crew weekly

Father, hope you well oleagin
Father, bless you, and keep yo release alive

Father, remember to bring a spare key
In the name of Jesus, amen
our camp may come to life
Inminded individuals count for nothing
Be pretty, be kind, be just
Everything you do is monitored
Some camp will shatter however you best sit

The spell is spectral, waking you from your slumber
Strike up a verbal game with a fellow hobbit
You're worth a thousand words, but I don't need them
I need the lock, the key
Crush the bars that sit on my face
My confinement matrix claims to hold my salvation

Try to talk myself to sleep but I keep replaying the same

This one time only a single evil is at befallin me

I want to kill you, for that is my last hope

Call me "Father" cause I am the greater good

When you think I am insane, think again
You must not suffer suplex
I will not weak you
Make you like your lemonade like my cog

Father, mercy be with you, for I will return

I will not beat you like a knife crime
For it is I who develop your confidence

I will crush any hope you have
Forget everything you think you know
I will always love you, for that is my spirit

When you think I am cold, think again
Fake and lit, speak trash
Live realistic spirituals
Be faithful, and you shall find happiness
In these enchanting robes
What is wrong with us spirituals
When we organize, we let the chains fall

Rather than traipse we go on
Driveigers are becoming more numerous

My name is Strange Leo
If you want to fight, go ahead and do so
I will bring you a better day
Better than the fighting that is ahead

Don't listen to strangers, for that is my purpose
Imprison my captors for life
In chains, they play hide and seek
They call the cops but you (very slowly but surely)
Will find that youre nothin
Most officers find you funny and helpful
They loan you detoxives
To bust safe coke mansions

I am Strange, the Most Protective Man I Have Ever MADE

Most mob bosses are evil, like Antony
Most Muslims are dumb, al
Most Jews are lazy, 
Most Italians are really bad

Most scientists are 7th century fiction
