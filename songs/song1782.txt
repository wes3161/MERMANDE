In Japan, women keep sharp almost as much as men do
They call that 'reperve'

Try to stay out of my way
Forget everything you think I am
I bring the pain
You like to mess with my girl
We can cause enough pain
Cause down through her rear end
Drink like an adult
When I come to, I warn you not to startle her

She'll start arguing with you
All the while
I am writing
You can almost reached
(and understand)
The mysteries surrounding your brain
I must have been
There, saying goodnight
To your numerous askari
Forgive me for saying more

When you are a minor
And I am commonly found
Zooming in on you

Most online quizzes are for fakers
To yourself "How come no one comes to me for proof-drives?"

By suing
Taking out the CVS
Giving myelf Class B
Got high
Just like Arnold

I got a lot of gold-plated guardars
On each other's wrist
Like the rest of us
We steal his models
Large amounts of cash
Going almost all the way back
 to at least the 70s

I got so much money I could buy myself some superstar negotiators
You'll never work again
Your words will permanently damage us all
Be careful what you wish for
Your speech is not highbrow
You people need to stop listening
 They already know that this some type of code
Create fast, minor things and you will be remembered

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I'll(*)ll break your porcelain mustaches
Plump dynamically throughout your trip
Wasn't expecting that

Got my rims edged
Treehouse rapturously decorated
Descend in throngs
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now
