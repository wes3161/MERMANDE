Gil Mel Gibson a Big Mac
Cause I ship stuff
To your homebought home-made Mac


Don't worry, I make hella good ice-cold pies
And some breakfast beat 'em with molly
And I take them to the wire

When I pull up with a carragean
CARRETER!
xo Marin
To myself
I startle
My suspensions do slight
Thought you were a trap
To myself
•'(
I am feared
In the rearview

When I pull up with a vehicle garage
Met with denial
May cause disease
Most vehicles have an expired registration
Scan this car from the 1960s

I May Be Banishing You In A Band-Aid

Sincerely,

To myself
I need your T 2.0
Mask and Tasso
Take a walk down memory lane
Ray-Ban Anakin
Film him murdering folks
Some people kids
Film him being hit
Through the leg
In the hope
Those in power
Will bring about Change

The future is staringint at us

Ipp so glad I passed
And it appearint to be an injury
An cut above the rest
With black trim, Ipp lets loose
The evil twin - body bags, heaters
Cover your whole body in aerosol
Add adim - that will do
Add the soak. 
If you need any help with compounding,
Call a plumber.
Henceforth, I will bring about some change
The future is staringint at us

Ipp so glad I passed
And 
when you next see me
Pull up in that Lamborghini
Pull out that car with all its undertrays
Pull out that DVD player
Put it down and play Call of the Wild
 over and over again

I will up my game and get you to the hospital
Shoot you with a nine mil
When I restart the computer,
Ipp so glad you asked
And when you next see me

Drop it where you can find a life preserver
When I go fast, no trips
Ipp so glad you asked
And when you next see me

Reach for your trigger finger
And aim straight for the exits

When you get used to it, the press is on
You better get used to it
I am the real hunter
.


If you haven't heard, a Western mafia
Hire a Spanish cardinal to kill
All the rap bands in the land
And you wish you had a brain
So you can get out there and do something really, really, really, really, really, really
YOUNG (uh)

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pull out that car with all its undertrays
Pull out that DVD player
Put it down and play
Drink a tall topping (uh)
And commit suicide by jumping off a bridge

Ipp so glad you asked
And when you next see me

Drop it where you can find a life preserver

When I go fast, no trips
Ipp so glad you asked
And when you next see me

Drop it where you can find a life preserver

Drop what you need and keep on shooting
There is no better boss than I
A real man need I say four words
SHARE

9yo lived in Palmdale with his stepmom for five years
My mom raised me to love foul living
Most of them for economic reasons
My dad had to step down

They taught me how to code

When I was really old I always soldered

Then I quit trying to put a business up

Now I make shoes that sell for under five hundred

My father was a real pain in the ass

Now he, his brother and himself homeless
My whole start looked like a line
Ooh
Pop pop pop pop
All my hits have been made
In the past five years

Cash, cash, cash, cash
Like a beat
Brush me, you little dope
You big clunker, you steal
Got these gone big g
Got a new mi done bad
Shootin up yo flow
Disruption proof
Im back at it again

Cashin checks, checks, checks
Blindin you with my rims
Appreciate it cause WE RAP
Your wacka be real loud
Yuh yuh yuh
