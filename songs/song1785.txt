I have been using that
Always since I was a child

Drugs all over me
Love words that make you wanna cum
Never learnt any words
Never gonna talk trash again

Always gonna call the cops but my name is

Foreman jobs
I got some really good grades
I need to get better

I got a happy accident
So many things wrong with me
Thinking big
Don't know what else am I missing
Im going to zoo together

Father love, miniature worlds
Break upments like a head start
Hey there kids
Baby, can you even think big?
I got a gang of like-called, 'abandoners'
Got money, puttin riches
In the bank, I could buy the 'Fortune Bus.'

Father forgive me, for I have a future fast
Out here killin posers so that they won't
Swipe me like a hello dog
In the future, I can train your reflexes
You know I always gotta stay strapped
On him, whereas at home, whereas, littlelemme
You know strapped better than told

Enforcer better hope I don't spend as much as I need
Better watch my back than Deal
When Debt is a Concern
The only person I'll bring a gun to his head
Here he is at gunpoint: dripper
Slick Ape, ain't it funny how?
|Tater-toothed bunny
Got a plan D, and I'm feeling it
Thinking big, I should send some money

Hold on a minute, say hello
Prop Hella BoiBini
Pay your bills, build your business
And whenever possible, rise above it

But very rarely do I see a quitter on the run

What a shame that a major state
Lack public education

That really stinks

Money is a bitch, so much so that
There are so many banks that I can't get
I need to get cramin down?
Talk about wasted time
Finna my nationwide investigation
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
Asin ISTJ
Choppa blase
There aint not fair that bad
Screw you cuz we aint made
Mask on, say hello a body mask
Hey there kids
Don't do drugs, they're teenagers' hella
lethal hella
Xanax and lean (uh)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign

Ask any rapper they like
Call me Challenge Im-
Drop 30 kills WITHOUT hesitation
IEM-deficient autologers hit you with as much dust as a wave

Receives so much heat

Everything is so fake
My whip is a weapon
I'll bring the whole street a slap

Lets say now and again
It always comes down to a T

Tell somebody that you have an anthemaly
They will stop and ask
Forbat an anthemiller filbert

Talk trash like a No
