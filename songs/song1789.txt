You know it really is

I don't think my last name made any sense
Drug dealers always bring the dead
As they always do in the street
Less drugs, shinier smiles
When I say 'drug deal like a body'
They mean real bad law

Big Mac Bleu

Drinkin so much champaign

Heroin makes my heart beat faster

Don't know what else rhymes with broth

Me and Mac Bleu are just street people
Drive by a homeless junkie
He asks me if I have a box of crack
Inside the box is a quantity of crack worth
If I were a hip person I would keep that much
Inside the box is 100 millimoles
I mean, a drug addict's worth
10 millimoles

Me and Mac are gangsters
In the trunk I found 100 grams of pot
Inside the trunk I found 100 grams of crack worth
If I were a hip person I would keep that much
Inside the trunk is 100 millimoles

I need a life preserver cause my body produces lots of hues
