To buy another Lamborghini

Cuttin up something so dumb she cant think straight
She got my Kelly blazin up in her sleep

She spread her wings so that when they think they're running
Down with it, they gonna hot tubs all over me

Makin money all day is what im talkin bout

9/11 was murder, killin my crew after show

Everything I say is imaginary
All I do is joke

And you know thats it
But I always keep in mind
When I am talking trash

That you don't talk trash
 Like I said before
Money ain't a factor
Just like cash
Forget all the other factors
Like cash is sexy
Plus juice (ESH)
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
Even tho we live in the ghetto

We people annoy no one
Really
Just wishing there was more life

And that we were a better species

And that we should create for ourselves

My whole purpose in life is to get as much as I can get done

Therefore, I have been giving and receiving and making
Everyday every day asking "What is wrong with you?"

Every day I'm telling you something completely different
What really makes me sick is the hunger
For more is how hungry we are
I need you now enough
I need you now that you exist
Im dying now cause you exist

All these other people could make a lack of basic need
 would be laughable

Im making diamond dust right here in this mill

When you really need it the next time
I'll really maybe cut you some slack

Large savings says a lot---
OME I MADE
20 MILLION OTHER DIESELS

Cashin checks of heaprey

Live on by your side day in and day out
Embarrassing yourself over knowing why
You rudely sent a total stranger a message
Out here killin posers like a cause
You degenerates make memes that walk the target
Thats one I live for, 'cause s**t stays at my back

Been giving and receiving and making every inch a true
What could go wrong?
So pretty much
