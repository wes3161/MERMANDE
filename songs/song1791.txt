Pull up to me like Krispy Kreme
Slut compiles all of her hard-earned victories
To herself in a mind-numbing 1,000 amount
She finally releases her drum kit and begins work on her single
She finally consumes caffeine and begins taking (an)
anabolic steroids
That entire time she was sleeping on my bed
Thrashing about in my sleep, buying myself some cause drinking
So much ice I almost slip
Droppin bombs like Ganges
Mercy moans throughout my song
Do I look like a brat?
I got a lot of makeup on
I need a body mask
Add that ghoul thinga and bring it next
