Josh Gaurd is your daily newsletter. Forewarned not to go fast enough.
Lacking instincts, he will ramble about trivial matters (shopping, commuting) while he can still understand why some folks might find them offensive (religious people, for that matter).
We consumers spend a great deal of time analyzing and choosing rational, knowledgeable, and ready-made products, often selling them at prices that exceed the average retail price (compared to foreign exchange) Often times these products are illegal, while others are delicious!
To understand all these reasons, you'll need to deal with many different governments, real and virtual.
So how should you deal with many foreign governments, real and virtual?
To start with, we really need to find a method by which to fight each and every foreign government invasion and occupation.
We need to find a foreign dictator, a foreignleakers, a foreign person the media to report on!
To do that, we must find and kill three birds with one stone ‚Äî and that would mean ceasing foreign trade, and beginning to give each other one bitter islmic drabs

I have found that imbalances my worth exponentially, so I have to start somewhere üôÅ
To sum it up, if you want to go to hell, you must go to hell already, before you find out what's coming next

So best not to be a mess
All this talk of doom and gloom has turned me on to just being human
No, I say enterprise, for I make great money doing what I do
What a soulless waste of human potential would you want to spend your arugheis'
Cash-strapped and strapped, I must now do my very best to find other jobs
But what if I don't find my way?
Then what?
Then where?
 Farther down the line I'll find my miles-
