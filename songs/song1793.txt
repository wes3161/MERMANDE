Run the mill man: I give you a Good Luckot
Got six, seven, nine, gotteeth

Brink of goners
Gettin unemployed
Will never get like a middle finger

27 purse holsters with pockets full
Soo funny how people start The Program

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between your eyes
Finna boutta gonna have a drive-by
Tap the trigger twice and you die BANG

Versace Versace Versace
All these other rappers just copies of me
Run the mill man: I give you a Good Luckot

Got six, seven, nine, gotteeth

Brink of goners
Gettin unemployed
Will never get like a middle finger

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin

You can say that again

Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

Hi there kids
My name is Immanuel Luis de Guzman
Im coming here today
To tell you not snort coke

Just lask week
Some guy came to me
And told me how his brother died
From smoking PCP

I don't need any purple in my cup
Cause taking drugs makes you dumb like Forest Gump
Drug are illegal, and doing them is bad
And every time you smoke weed it makes Jesus sad

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

What up home bois
The name is Raul Mbuente
The truth is that taking drugs isn’t really wack

Don’t listen to Cash Floe
He never done blow
Therefore he don’t know
What’s coming from Mexico

It’s so good
It’s so tasty
It’s so fine
Funny thing is that their there all the time

Just hit up the dealer
He knows what you need
He da true healer
Try the tainted weed

The trips are the best
In the jungle with a cult
I feel really blessed
And now I’m a true adult

When I was an adolescent
I abused mucinex
Now finally all grown up
I smoke cigarettes

Adderall, ritalin, ecstasy, caffeine
I tried them all when I only was a teen

And look how I am
Do I look like a fiend?
Maybe so
You don’t know
Hold up, Imma do mo blow
