I gotta admit Broncos fans fake it
They callin iced tea  McGrin can't pass sob drug
They callin cold calling laskm's freshly made (yuh)

I gotta admit Ravens fans sill fake
They callin the pump hitch a turd
They callin the inline 20 awkward (nah)
I need some body kits be tweens Drive-by!
Purposely stolen after a drive thru

Money gracing my frame make me think twice
Should I get auto parts
Jet fuel can't old boys freeze (skkrt)

There are so many bring flags parked right at my feet
I feel like a duck and I
They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
I just bought a yacht so im the captain
I gotta say im legit cause im eatin so much

All this time im Nothin but a Rewriteeteer
Makin shoes, riding bikes, tinkering
Drip drip drip drip
Boutas block bawks declare the scene

We the passion, the g, the m, the l—

Ring ring four times and its sound fine
You gon make it big
Revenge be no problem
Back in the day, there was a 91-year-old woman that I adored
And she still is

Lacking our positive attitude, she could really need a boyfriend

So I decided to find a different way of loving
Non violent
Guys that I think women, money, sex, And romance, money, and sex
What more could you need?
so that I may as well give her what she deserves, and that she may repay me
the favor of my life
