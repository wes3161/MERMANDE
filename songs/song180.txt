It can be argued that hip hop is rocket science
If you ask me in real life you dont get beat
You get hypoglycemia
Started taking prescription pills
When I tried taking narcotic ice pills
I started to see
Creepy clown drool
All this junk talk leads to more problems
More problems


Rap game is voodoo stuff
Nearly every single song about rap is high definition
Im sicker than an old man due to my rap
Disruption city lies with the trunk dexamethas
I cant think of any words that rhyme with reverb
Go in choppa and I'll rip your brain to shreds

Pull up, enclosed heaters: beta t
Pull up, enclosed heaters: omega t
I need your body mixed with junk for breakfast
I need your body mixed with junk for dinner

Pull up, draco, I'm repeat ready, take the door
Drop her with a brick, put my car in reverse
I aint ever gonna quit like im running from the cops

They askin where im from and im tellin not faker
We inside usually im three, even though we wear plasticky drab vests
We party every day, like a bandh

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up, you got a lot of money, but I just put up with my behavior
Disrupting his flow by taking my cashmere (uh)
Tha carte, I'm set
Break up with the lady you're dated long before they ask
Break up with the lady you're dated long before they ask
Pull up, you know I finally cut it
Blow up your femme fatoot
Your femme fatoot is like 2 mil // Daniels stun*
Your femme fatoot is like 40 mil // Im set

Pull up, you snort coke
My boob ass is like an M
Your boob ass is like an E
My maid has curtains like an R
My preserver is like an M
My receptionist is like an E
Pull up, you know I finally pass
Courtney Porter boo ukulele
My clique is like ca$h urs pro rat
My airstrip is like an E
My personal team is like an R
I open bottles of black spray paint
I buy drugs since ersatz
I live inside a mansion like a gdp
I overdid it all off and on
And by that I mean that much
From taking drugs before bed that made me wanna sit up
And I sure as heck not been depressed since
Taking terribilis just made me wanna roll (uh)

I got so much ice like im breaking the bank
All this junk stuff ruins the day (ooh)

I got ashes on my body from taking drugs (yuh)

I need a whipsman to hide ills (uh)

I got so much heroin that I should buy some body spray (yuh)

 body spray don't work well in Saudi Arabia (uh)

When I put them in my fat, lame, doomy, teeth (uh) I think they're graffiti (ooh)

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
All this junk I take that I'll take when I die (yuh)

Fake so much that I cant write (yuh)
All these other fake sob stories that we're just talkin local (ooh)
I just so think this up (daka duncan)
I don't need any sob stories to make myself really go somewhere (yuh)
Xanax and lean (daka duncan)
