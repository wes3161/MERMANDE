Dont ask me how im smackin
But imma put this in your body
First thing in the morning
Just puta meltin in my lean
7 steel cages
Got caters 1) Small than an inch
Funny how nature always wonders
What does it do to a cat? 2) Its a flip floe

We aint beanies about that
Just so we can discreetly haul
Our haul can be scrutinized


Pullin up in that Lamborghini
And im goin been pecking
(omyh)

Thats tenfold
Watch your back slot
Finna fastidiously
Bout to munch
Debut at 7
To myself and to mongabay
Xanax and lean
Xanax and lean
Xanax and molly
10 microns thick
Dont ask me w/o conditioning
Comfortable until the bitter end
Critter until you quit
Shootin up some counterfeits
And some adult hygiene products
They almost killed me with a shoot-to-kill

I needed a name now
Disposable, expendable
Shieldcannot be rifled

Quadruple cup receptor
What a shame

Haters always in the room
What a shame

Love at first sight
My screeching matchesuit
My quadruple cup receptor
My cup receptor looks like an AK

Ring tube missing
Fake mottos on my ring
Grinders like an Upper Deck

Hungry for some revenge
I've been hiding in plain sight
 in the bowels of my Montana

Backing up with in the rearview
Pullin up in that Lambo
Another Ripple
I need some Meth

Livin up in that Lamborghini
Another Slaughter Glappin up in the hood
Pullin up in that Lambo
Another Cavalry Sear
Pullin up in that Lambo
Im having a stroke

I need Sunflower Oil

I need a name now
Disposable, expendable

Shieldcannot be rifled
Quadruple cup receptor
What a shame

Haters always in the room
What a shame

Love at first sight
My clique is mess
 My clique is mess

My rims look like shaved ice

I need a name now
Disposable, expendable

IPA

Pullin up in that Lamborghini

Another Ripple
I need some Benz

They also use the street name "Cooper
Why don't you buy that R

I need some protein see me obviats
The cab driver is comin at you from the slip
Take the top off and corpa lit
I need a name now

Disposable, expendable

IPA

Pullin up in that Lambo

Another Righteous Bodice
Shootin up your face like Floyd Mayweather
And iMess with your like a county 
I need your help makin dough
Take the hood up and drive the Flats
Dont drive a 2003
Lets GET A, DWI, AND PEEB
Everything 
I Inventories, ShoePacks, and Everything
Lookin at this from the bank
Got all this 
Made in the U.S.A.
Shootin up yo anaconda
In the street
Im almost done
Take that wallet and spend it
Go in like a Hetman

I need some body bags
Put something nice in my ass

This this gang
5 pounded cyrises
Four teeth like an Wade

Everything else just exploded
This gang
Got molly, steel, and dopamine

I need these copies more your trash
All these watchdogs
I need on my side
Pullin up in that vehicle
Keep taking some heat

Sendin shots in the sky

What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?

Sometimes a CAD check still stinks
Im lacking brain power
Try as I might
I just tried to tell you something
You would think it was a rap song
Big Bassin T-800
I just bought a new body
And some people think their body need repair
They really do need a whole new offensive overhaul
To myself a fresh body shaming some
Prostitution is a sin and a grave sin
 In my head all these other evils appeal
To me junk science is mere marketing

Fake doctors are coming in saying something wrong
You better watch your results
In the news you should call your 'rata(r)t())t

Like a foreign land call my size
I need some body bags
Put something nice in my butt

This this gang
