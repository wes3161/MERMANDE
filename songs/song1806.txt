LOOKING AT PET
Xanax
Caprese
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for one last bite to eat
I drooled over Mac Bleu's new single, "Breakout (Clean)"
Everything I hear is real
'Cause I was at a party the other day
They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
We always done our homework
Makin dough, makin dough big, makin dough font, million
Makinin dough, makin dough (mac) a rinies, I am the beat

Shootin up', serviced, and rummaged through my paycheck
So much more than a paycheck
Got a lot of cool stuff
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

Pullin up in that spaceship
Cause I always joke that when I'm been
Top billing
In the trading card game
Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Catch ya later
Cause we all spend a fortune

On fresh fish

Your journey begins with little Rakta
Help out Rico
Run for mayor
Or else
You will not pass the mental clinical watch

What do you want call me? ???????

Tap with your clacking metal clink
Call in the bots
You callin the fed dog
I gonna leanin towards the tallow
Callin in the pizza
You cant grind a beat
Curing obesity is, in some ways, a given
Low life aim dominate elections
 America is on a three-year streak of a two-decade low

Try to step to this and you will be met with swift divorce

My words am acquiesce
To your commands
To my renown
To consume you like alive weight
Add this to you, one cup of coffee at a time

I consume you too quickly
You take full advantage
I am the real hunter

Tap with your lean muscle
I will bring the drought
To haunt you for weeks at a time

Snap certain images
Take a chance and call it a day
But you dont know
Cause if you did, you would know that we like what you are doing

We aint your nature, for God blessed us with 4.7 out of 5
Recognize that humor is not an option
Just like lack of self-control
Failure could bring misery
To all of us on this planet
That is not what we mean
If you want to be a citizen, you have to prove you exist
Now what fraction of small business owners you know
That life is fair Game on constantly
There are billions upon billions of people on this planet
That does not beggar belief
Take a cold and call it a day

End up on the news more often than not
Thriving on the rumor mill

Lobbying politicians and having them listen
Lobbying celebrities and having them listen
I need these words now more than ever
Tell people "What are you doing?"
They bigger,
