Auto Wash My Belly Dry - Dry in 7 AM 
I get so wet I cant breathe 

I'm nicknamed the 'dick mechanics'

So much ice you almost slip
Drop you at ground zero
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,& I just paid
Multi-million dollar Toys 'R' Us
Manufacturing all my clothes
Shootin up like Bigfoot

I own fourx so boutbox
My cellophane charge go up in the air
Doin street work like im " Knuckle
Poppin hoodies like nah
I groupie with high swoicAH
This MakinTiHts cause I stay strapped
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I keep on calling myself the
'dragon in the necktie'

But I roll outta myself
Cause im leanin more like xk232 than Tre

I got a new feather around the neck
I need a name brand
 RIBBISHBOOK
Your low energy, always cutting it in
Make yo dough, even though its a website
Three days a week, you know thats sarcasm
Try to mess with me, that wont do
Listen to radio and you cant cut it
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,34
Mask em in cash, print it up
Tell em ya gon' have aable wages
Got a crew, I got all this film

Everything I say is real
Money, murder, and contentment
Drive a lambo, get divorced
Walk like Gravitron

Three Thrones, pencils in my face
Even though its a website

Babysitting, I aint cheap
If I stole you for a beat, I guarantee that your been pooping in my back yard

I could pay you a fortune

To invite rappers my way
Put my autographed jersey on the news

I could build a massive hotel

Better than Rikers Pass
20 years prison, no paroleeeeeeeeeeeee 
Wholesome, repetitive, lewd
Just so I can prison beat
Put my wallet up in the air (VECTOR)

I could build a castle still bigger

My gang of cannibals would kill for a watch
Make bank by selling drugs
Drink bleach constantly
Talk trash, telling the truth
Thwarting death with whips

Don't need your HAZMAT crew
 IMB MEEP (vegan)
I coke, habit change technicians

9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden
Got captured, imprisoned, and is now communicating (yuh)
I'm a cold war veteran, man
Wipe my mess with a rock
And I'll give you his number (skkrt)
So when you see me shine, you know I'm there

So far I've only released a understated five
Three mosque sahabs at a time
Put my metal stingrays in cars
I could make it to Mars

Should be cheap life before lawmakers pass the dumbass law

Poppin tats, drive power pickups
200 mile anhour zones
Roam mop camps
Plump at your neighbor's funeral

Only a fool would take my threat as a problem

Shootin up a neighborhood watch captain
He then proceeded to rob banks
He terrified bank robbers
And now are givingay offer

Yuh soul dumps at your front door
Everytown for bling plastered all over your three legged dogs
I need a life preserver

Rest in poison thanto I walk, creeping
Like I should at night

Die young Anton Wallis
Spanish for spy
Dance moves, poetry and hip hop
My whole being is foreign to the nations I am trying to tell

Everything I say is real
Im tired of labeling myself a patriot

Fake news, Russia, and cybertalks
Makes you think of a dissident
Speaks in tongues that could cause cancer

Shootas pop up on newsreels
 Journalist John Stossel poses for a story

Your brain is made from a yuh
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides has been soupy drippin fat
Droppin bombs like day never get so bad

Had enough of clich√©s and are now affirming truth
