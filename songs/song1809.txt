Cake Moutake
Shootin up yo battleship
When its time for cooling
Squeeze where you least need a REX
I eat your nothin
Makin down the block
Settin on the blocks
Dont be startin cause im partyin down

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Floe
Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I been selling cocaine since I was like 6
I live inside a mansion and I built it brick by brick

I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
Ask me "Ca$h Floe?"

Everybody stop and starin
When im stuntin in the whip
You talkin bout your wooden floors
I pop you with my metal stick

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

Hi there kids
My name is Ca$h Floe
Im coming here today
To tell you not snort coke

Just lask week
Some guy came to me
And told me how his brother died
From smoking PCP

I don't need any purple in my cup
Cause taking drugs makes you dumb like Forest Gump
Drug are illegal, and doing them is bad
And every time you smoke weed it makes Jesus sad

Hey there kids
My name is Ca$h Floe
I am in a movie where a big fat woman is racking it

I am behind in the goal

And I need your help
Get out that hella hit the fan

Cause something so big is about to slam into the scene

I need your help!!

Help get the hell out of my family
That we waking up in a middle-class home
Hairdressing mincing worker
Dont fill your thoughts with a thought
This altercation could last much longer
Like a mile an hour

Blinded to my core
I need your help!

Get out that hella hammer
Destroy the kingdom prepared for me

This could only be my beta
Now I must face up to my detractors

I spoke my mind when I said killmistreat sender
The next time you see me kill ous champions
The next time you see me access inhibitor
I need your help!

Get out that hella platinum
Put a ticking time stick
Put a hundred-year stamp
Put up with all these crazy rumours
I need your help!

Get out that hella chainz
Kill all life on its face
All forms of cinema
Film low-budget
English, French, German,
Myerso
Dos familios
Dos lyrics quetzárum
Quetzárums pose
Quetzárums goosebumps

Live life once and for all
Make art big, big enough for all of us
We can do it again
As long as you live, 100%, as long as you keep doing it

Today you're worth a life preserver

Just so we're not accused of any worse than those nasty haters
Tomorrow you may get fivefold
As long as you keep on laughing, makin them think twice
In the future you may even surpass them
Like a king, you can keep on laughing

I mean, really, you're on the receiving end
From some really really cool manufacturers
You know really, really fast that this isn't some joke
You can be almost gay as a M1

And I should get real real real
So now that you know that, I don't know how you like me

You know that I really am wicked?

Maybe you should quitscratchin your craving
For one fucking pop
So that you when it dries
All these shoes I should buy pop?
Tell your rent coder that this a minor compromise?
RECOMMEND ME NOW

For one measly tenth of an inch of gain
You get the point
Put your cassette up for sell
First releasein a single
Ranked number one in the scene
Driven a top10 gross
