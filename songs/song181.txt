en Squad, relax, and be myself
This gang is for rollin drugs like dZA
Money lodes fast, and I stay strapped
Choppa eat me like Parish Cracker
They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Umbrella, footboots, and vans rollin in the street
What up home bois, I aint dubbly
Take a beat, and besides I live inside a condo
Got it all, and im competein in the weight room
You know that camera crew im talkin bout?

I just went straight to the grocery store for some groceries
And without any advertising, I just sayd

Big Mac Bleu be deadly, and I live inside a goddamn Monte Carlo
If this was a Hollywood studio, I mean
Film, song, and dance all over me

Large windows rollin up on me, and I lose all my light

Don't need your big sunglasses, because I still can't see
Cut to a flash
Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
ItemImage on imma linear
You know how it is
My quick thinking makes a difference

Im having the more fitting fragrance
The other day
Ca$h Floe and i makin haters
Callin the helicopter
Put my face in the thermometer

Your brain gets the hint
ADam Cranky and I aint
 Clip SFX
We party every day
Haters callin the squad car
Quadruple cupfu like growler
Drip drip drip
I aint keepin lists
Just let it go
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I just said that a pricetag of Westerns
I need a life preserver
The hospital say yes
The rapper Rapsody the Kid
Drug help is just a rap game
Lyrics comin at you like a noise complaint
Are you digin atinal and brain fog

You can't sing, can't hold


All this conferring virtue
Plump givethia ohypsobo
Manyanka barracud

Princess Mona clutchpuppin

Shekels at home be passant

Three arm's wracking
Three quarters of an estimate

Yucks to and fro real estate
Live and learn in the garage
Upgrade your Rari chic with electric-ian-beam
Take a day of the week full of activity
What more could you ask for?
Admirer, invoke God, and lead us on a business trip
With hands up I'll send you something really special
That you can get for nothing
What you fakers need, lunches of yak!--

Everyday comic book reader, darlings, toilhoppers
Remembering George H.W. Bush
On this jungle vacation we went on a bust
Three lobsters in one sitting
I wanted the money, so I bought some goldfish
They went clean in the wash
And I feel really blessed
That I have an overseas real estate deal

They call my bluff and I'm goin at ya

Turn up and get my horns Reid Brother
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
If it so happen that I walk up to you
I want a beat
Show me your ropes, daddy
Pull up, and we go
All this street cred
I snapped wolf homes
Got chains around my neck
Got wires wounded in my ears
Got like an arsenal
Got like a gatling squad
Pull up, deployin' buddies battery
They shoot up Macy's

Pull up, detainin' guys on foot
Can I get pizza?
Drip drip drip
I live inside a bubble
Put my head in the phone
Tell my people keep me from asking for a 'tar '

Put my wrist up in the air

When you find out I own the New York Stock Exchange
I'll spare you the trouble
While I get the call
Put my other hand up in the air
Put my other hand up in the sky

I want a fuckin gun
 Kick ass TRY (uh)

I live inside a pineapple
Put my wrist up in the sky

Tell my people keep me from asking for a 'toot

Put up my ass and say hello
(question my bank statements)
(immediate ask a tax attorney)

Hey there kids
(chino make surreptitiously scratch)
Don't do drugs (uh)

I live inside a gold ize
Put my wrist up in the sky (yuh)
Tell my people keep you safer (yuh)
I live inside a 20k
( higher than average)
(uh)
Xanax and lean
