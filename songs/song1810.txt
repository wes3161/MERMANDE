Lets get this over with! We the loudest!

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Imps come in all shapes and sizes
I keep it simple
Keep it lit
In your sig

Money, rocks, and pop
My features pale in comparison
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im 9/11''ing here, now its your turn
Send em like home heatin

I use Smash Mouth DOOM

When im with a projectile in the air, its a first for the street
I spray my gun like its a cup gun
Now that im serious, im 28

I need a life preserver cause im in my party

Im a millionaire like nobody else

So when you see me cruisin down the street
I startle your crew and they ask where am I
Help you skkrt how you get this far
Surround yourself with messiahlike states
You can be any colour, any time
Just sayin
 Killer intent here
Enough with the cryptic
All these rappers sound like total trash
Im 9/11''ing here, now its your turn
 Send em like home heatin
I use Smash Mouth DOOM

When im with a projectile in the air, its a first for the street
I spray my gun like its a cup gun

Now that im serious, im 28

I need a life preserver cause im in my party

Im a millionaire like nobody else

So when you see me cruisin down the street

I startle your crew and they ask where am I
Help you skkrt how you get this far

Surround yourself with messiahlike states
You can be any colour, any time
Just sayin

5 front areights
 1 inch drape
White picket fences
I roll up in my lap
Do you wanna look at my grapefills

Pull out your squad car
Pull out my trigger finger
And spray the street

Pull out my butt home
Can you even begin to understand
What it is im saying?

I got a lot of shootas than protocol
Should be cause for alarm

Shootas all over the place
Call the cops at the church
Add that illegal drugs list
And cause some to become pastors
They ask for mercy from God
Call the priesthood at the temple

I want to send a clear and present clear
That you aint unwelcome
I will not deal with you like a con
In the name of the good name, Jesus Christ
Respect and uphold the laws
In everything I do
I end up at strip malls
ECAUSE I CAN GET LOVER MOTELS

Gucci. I own it all.
I'll do for you everything ska slash, true to its word
Mask on, oh boy im stuffed
Power lines at your front door

Cuz of the power of ska
You can get the mask bought at thrift stores
Bout to

Big Mac Bleu
Im coming here today
To tell you not snort coke

Just lask week
Some guy came to me
And told me how his brother died
From smoking PCP

I don't need any purple in my cup
Cause taking drugs makes you dumb like Forest Gump
Drug are illegal, and doing them is bad
And every time you smoke weed it makes Jesus sad


Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up
