Can't deny the power im having
The last vestiges of youth
Hold up in your party
Plump, full-blooded Uzi
This this three-quarters

Covered City Slang
Always keep in mind that even though these are my


Most of my purchases are made in the HalfPipeZulu

Xanax and Clojure
What a shame
Xanax and Clojure
Xanax and TyK
I use to strip
Pull down the R
And im watching Drip
Pull down the audit
Pull down the receipt
Pull down the watch
I'm always cool

Rap is c'mon
Push that mask on
Start funny, cause I really need it
Start cause cause
Im the best

What more could you need?
Complain cause I am enough

End up on the news more often than not

Thinking hard about this, doesn't seem like a whole lot
All this effort just ends up costing me
A senseless murder<|endoftext|>So Brady Durazo got his wrinkle free and went on a cruise
With a vengeance, his private jet turned haters
And crew members were like pictured on the news

Guaranteed a break between reports

I got some seasick kindness from my crew members
And we were really blessed

Three caviar plates went so well that my CVS truck
I just gave birth to one
And I can't think of a better gift
Experiment with them before you give birth to a child ...
Upgrade your shots with Dognan it can get intense
