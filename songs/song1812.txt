Inside your drizzle clear well
Brush this Asian chick on the spot
She always sports that white picket sign
You better hope not that a

Shoot you with a 30 mm autotune
Cause chaos throughout your five feet
Admitting defeat makes you an albatross

A spoonful of granola is all I need
To really get the job done
I really must get this scammer off my back
