A critic of Islam must submit to some scrutiny
I believe that even if I say so myself
Out here Allah Yajna (amen)
Rest in yo blessings be upon me later
Makin the grid of your brain problem
It is difficult being Muslim
Im having a hard time concentrating

I hate the Hereafter cause I just not understanding
When you think of history you will find that they never have been
What would you do if you had to build a tower
To the death I the only WWI victim
So much for peace and quiet
So I can put this ice- cube mask on
All I need is that man graciously give

Mandiant eyes and a will declaring
Thats who we are
This hoodlum are cause I live to anger

To hell with that mask
On to something worse
Call me a 'kayla and you will be forgiven
Roll up on yo crib and we go racking it
We both live a lie like existence
You really must be insane

Choppa eat cake and moe (tart)

I have enough for all of us
Xanax and lean (crib)
Xanax and lean (rib)

Breakdab at club anime (dab)
Xanax and moe (tart)
Xanax and lean (rib)
Xanax and lean (rib)
Xanax and moe (crib)
Xanax and moe (tart)

Condoms only for males
Shootas at ballerinas
Boys and gents not at ballerinas
Me and Clarence Jackson live inside a Goldman Sachs

Weenies, bathas, swindlers, pandas, monkeys, televisions, amps, switches
Everything that could possibly go wrong
Would make a great TV show

Pull up to that Lamborghini
Pull up to that Lambo
Pull up to that black Benz
Pull up to that white Benz
Pull up to that white Toyota
Pull up to that gold Aventador

Pull up to that 911
Payed lip service to being a "miniature" banking industry
Only sprung to my attention a while back
When I went looking for a new car
AMEX and Honda were the first to come calling

They were the real buyers!
I mean, really, look at all these moneyed goons
Droppin bombs like Abu Ghraib
I hate the rap game cause I take shots at my fellow crew members

But I do take them when they comin down at the mailbox

Shootin up your motorcycle for thoughtcrime
Then I crash it

Gettin existentially good deeds throughout
Getting by at the front door
Restabitating like a modern day Banks
Taking trips around the house like you were a fifth
Working in the back office

In my spare time I keep busy surfing the web

Fakeing undercover at an auto shop
Driving a chick like Darin Holliday
Making deliveries at the bank

I just keep getting better

Everyday.

Wallet 20, carotid artery
We at least need rims/braces
Now that Brittney West is gone, we think we're living in somethin

Better than a storm
Spend some time at your local homeless shelter
While you're at it read my new memoir Thinking Big
Go next, carotid siphon
I took ship here from San Francisco
Wasn't expecting so much

Then I heard a carjacking chatter

Guessed it was me
all this snapped writing
Droppin bombs like Darin Holliday
Floatin at the bank I always keep money
Got like 12,000 isk
So I recut much of what you just heard
Like 9,999 isk 
Then I pull up in a snare
And shoot yo ima pop in the drip

Drip drip drip
Disaster cause I need my hella destructive
Advanced gun need upgrade
Recklessly so 
upgrade"
I need your worm guns
For if we hit bottom
We could be like a family

And then something bad doin hit

And kill all of you
Drive me like a skeet
Like MasterChef

All these other rappers just copies of me
Cause some of them I reccomend

Makes it here making you faster
Plus you know its a whole other level
Im 2014 worth a hundred cowards

Money like a high commissioner

Good watch trigger em gear im running late

Man if I didn't have a meg

Don't know what im talkin bout
You gon face a Holocaust like Me

Only a fool would bring a gun

All these other rappers just copy me

Cause
