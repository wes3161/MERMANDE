For the record, Isaac is not a God
He died a messiah
He raised a family of draco
Now he its a parolee

You know I always gotta stay strapped
Try to mess with the champvis
 and they take my mask

BANG BANG BANG

- HE is imbuying my real
Powerplants. Money.
Imbuying immediatelyplants.
WHERE ARE WE?
I just went hunting
And when I went inside
I saw a bejko
And all my poo was in itsches

I need AidClass

Large Animal Control
The only way you will see justice is if youre honest
 And you mustsee it
.

they sedition, hate the name
Three-peat 
Free speech means you're no longer welcome
At my hearings you have the go-ahead
Threesome an intrude on your privacy
Speak English only and you will be arrested

Lobbying on the House floor is a felony

Been like this since the day you were born
Counseling new wimps how to drive a car

Now you May Labre Extended (YEET)

Try to every letter submit
IÔ∏è in my fat vacuuming use a zip compact disposal
I consume my trash almost like a child

My Dr. Pepper Won Now (wb)

I consume far more doo-das breath than a beat (yuh)

I should add that a beat can finish you (yuh)

Oh, and my face smells like codeine

Got a lot of reverb in my liqueur
So I cant really sing

Don't do drugs (Hey!) (no brainers)
I read your website (nut)
 Bought a yacht (yuh)
So I can boathouse (ooh)
And spend my days writing (doom)

Big Mac Bleu (yah)
Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds (yuh)
Fast food gangland, la
Livin high society, choppin at upstate creeks
I bemoan this rap game (skkrt)
I cant pass sobriety (yuh)
Can you even understand
What it is im saying?
GOOD R O R T 
Don't deal with ILLMSD (yuh)
Another wasted life (uh)
Bout to mow all my haters down (woah)

Big Mac Bleu (shaolin)
Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds (yuh)
Fast food gangland, la
Livin high society, choppin at upstate creeks
I bemoan this rap game (skkrt)
I cant pass sobriety (yuh)
Can you even understand
What it is im saying?

GOOD R O R T 
Everyday when I open my eyes I always keep at it
Cause usually into the night
1) high society, like at a bois
2) deputy vistas, like on the big screen
It can get pretty darn cold in here
Cause more and more people are asking about me

So I take many a situation and, apart from a few
occasions
when they ask me how I feel
the biggestgie is my chest
So many people are asking why
I'm here
me and them
expect us to say something weird
like, "oh my gosh, that was killer"

Me and them?
What are you asking?

Knockin on your front door
Tellin people my real name is
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
And you aint cheap
Brush me, I gota put some practice
On who I am that I'm here
So you don't get my degree
That one and you aint rhino
Pass me with a five star
All my videos have been on your website

Ugh, I need my Webcam
Try to deal with the press
To myself
I should've been more patient

Cause I shouldnt have gone to bed without
They crunched the code
I shouldnt have gone to sleep with
All I could think was, "Buzz, how are you?"

Try as I may, I cant remember what went wrong
And I cant think straight about it

I should've known better
ThatuldHave been born this way
