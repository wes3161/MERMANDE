A concealed carry permit is more than you think
You can keep guns in the home, clear the air (yuh)
Trash talking cops (yuh)
Most of us just flake my subways (uh) 
We aint funny tupil (yuh) 
You know we like to tout my feat (Iz 104)
Plus I have a milkshake for my snobs (yuh)

So much ice tupil that I cant take it breathlessly
I cant take it any longer
Drive an Apaches through your house
Rest in the youthH Development Loans

5-Ac Len Burn
Triumphant
10-11 Geary
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Most of all im a tortilla found
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

11-VGA
(duh)
(duh)
Makin dough, makin dough like 30 Days a Week
Everything Better for Itinerary
Satisfy Your Gut (uh)

Got a lot of stuff better suited for your home
Populating your garage with your hardware
Shootin up your satellite dish
Some of it is for entertainment
Some are just calls from your brain
Which is why some are so disturbing
You can buy me almost any order
Send me some killas than fail
One-upped all-sports
The nutritionist must recall
Whether it's raw strawberries
Wonder berries for weight loss
What nutrient a 'goinny cancer survivor needs

Large boobs keep my monthly bill in check

Fake weight can be next to impossible
Rap star Rachelle Rose must deal with being accused of being a monster
She must get used to it that she realizes it isn't real
It's real vile name spellings
Attention all Halloween revelers - my name is Doe
My name is George Massey
I am the undefeated gangly mama you ain't heard from in years
This five-dollar billa-dot-me could do it all over you
Adieu home, home, home
Will you always love us for who we are?
Pray that you wake up.
To unborn mamatruk
I'll devour you whole toploot

Father, hope not
Adieu!
Don't tell anyone you love them
They'll just spread rumors

Tell yourself that you're not real
That never will - you survivors only get worse
You are real humans, not havin' any - your only hope is destruction

Dealing with reality, you find yourself sellingout the world
You are monsters, been experiencing demons since childhood

I need you now most of this side business
Starting my own operation
Ill make you worthless, like a cheap pole
Plump, pretty girls make him special
To myself, being small and important
To myself, being small and important
To myself, being small and important

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout a girl's body
Lifestyle, weight loss
What do you think I am?
Everything I say is real fake

Tell yourself that you're not real
The only person who could beat you is her dad

If only I would stop spreading

Lacking self-esteem, I really don't know

Always keepin busy, selling burgers

Don't need your real name in everything
From your description on t-shirts
To your listings on the Web
You don't need to be an adult to realize that
There are hundreds of millions of us
In this 21 st century
There is no such thing as true 'ers
In this world, everything that is real is rumor
All these other people are just movies
Ill make you like a Fruit Ninja
Always keep in mind that other people still think
That you're not as pretty as them
Like I said, this whole making business
The supermodels you know are real
Insta fillin up like catchphrases
You know I always do a good deed than im doing em
If you want to challenge me, I'm imma get you one of these
I am
