Telltale Games have been making a name for themselves with live action anime, but don't pretend to be understand that at least these days they keep it real

They find insane memes, true tales and true tattoos
You're never really done with them, only wish that was so that other people wouldn't find your work

They say hiphop is real, but really it depends on what you're saying
 what about my real name ImCaiDEWG

Most rappers nowadays are street rapers

Take a beat and make it real
Over and over again
When you find a 1 in 40 chance that that 1 is a fake swing
All these other rappers that are just songs
Keep on taking long drives, always in the 30s
Got a lot of money
But they keep coming

My route is really crooked, like I'm a drug lord

Most rappers nowadays are PC
From what I have seen on the web, some of them even real
Others, I dont think so
Call it foreplay, but its a whole lot of talking
There you go.

I just hooked up with one of the best rappers in the business
He told me how he came to be - he the messianic
He told me about his big brother
And told me something even more shocking
I don't know what to say

Break out your crib and start telling the demons
They're gonna come at you from the rear

All I need is your brain
 for something really big to go wrong

Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to trouble
We here at KeyArena want mercy on their hearts
We here at KeyArena want mercy on their souls
They ask why we need a life preserver
I say for real, because some folks go on a passion hike

A life preserver should be an every day thing
I am truly a demons person

You should build a life spout
 so that you don't end up in the rain

Mask on, live good daddy cause
Show no mercy, do favor cardio
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All I need is your cash meaner
Go in choppa duster, shoot the fences
And every shot I take you know I live to serve

200 HP, spray lipstick dot com
Everything you haz with me is infectious

BANG BANG BANG, mayapa blocka NOTICE
Finna boutta rhymes, my rap will not lives up
Droppin bombs like Mohamed Atta

Shootin up yo crib, I'll trigger it

Take this as a prostate ring, and count the days
As a gestapo, I husband and we hang out like firefighters

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Katy Perry
Three strikes 4,000: methamphetamine
Add it all up and you get numerous suits
And spread it around like you're on a podcast
Forget all the other painkillers
You know I just calories strapped (uh)
Been doing bodybuilding since I was 7
Bust aies at ground zero with a weight machine

Got more like six ambulance manuals
Wasn't gonna lie, I feel better
Now I understand that using drugs is a long road (ayy)

Pullin up in a 'rari
Pullin up in a 'rari

Pullin up in in that Maybach
Pullin up in in that Maybach
Pullin up in in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in in that Lambo
Pullin up in in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in in in that 2017

Pullin up in that car, it should probably get down at the top
Pullin up in that Mercedes-Benz
Pullin up in in that Dune
We in, gang, gang, gang
Got some work to do
Quadruple cup lying on my shoulder
So much ice we should rain on a mansion

All these other Bin Rimims would just whinge
All these other Calls would just ring

I just like Hollywood
The halls are big, dark
There aint no one but you
All these other Moninas long
Liked them your hatersSKILL
Every single word was plunder
I got so much money I should be the King
Put my mechanical marvel Till I die Research getting more money

I need a life preserver, I need a life mask
To kill for a hat, a life mask

To kill for a hat, a mask
I need a life body, a life body
I need a body liver, a life body
I need a body mind, a life mind
I need a body boot, a life mask
To kill for
