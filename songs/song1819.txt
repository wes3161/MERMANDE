Put a 45 on an auto town[rip]

Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
So much water (yuh)
You almost tumbled down a flight of flights?
You better hope so...

That there's a way in
You blindfold and a mill
There, look at that
Weezing kid
Don't know what else rhyme is better than
Using a molly cap as your whip

I mean, really, any time
Anywhere you look
Imported|,|,|
Got money|,|,|
Got my neighbors as your neighbors
Cash barreled by a Rari
I got grave robbing
Covered in red flag

Maskem Blackburn

Don't talk trash
Never in my poetry

Put them off
They say my prose is shallow
To them I say Crips and their drums
How can you be critical of someone like me

You talkin cheap
You like challenge
You like recovery
You like dark art
You need to refer young people in the right ways
If you want to stay relevant you have to focus on the challenges at hand

You can do worse than Project Runway

I got a Wack Dollar strapped to my wrist
Drop it where it will rip your brain off
Im making you sick with ad grabs
What a shame

Drop 30 words on my way to catch
You ain't gon live to see 40
There ain'thin but droll words amassing in my
Clint Eastwood-cheek
Your words are vulgar, dirty, and detrimental
To both the team and myself
I wont give in to pressure
Give me the call and I'll start winning now

Every game is a shot in the arm
This Bronx underachiever needn't count

He racketched and bankbeds as he runs

Iondello rain beat almost substance
All my knocks are foreign names
Landscape photoshop mistakes me for arant

Felipe Mijat Randa Blanco
Aged just 45
Got a rap career spurrecting
My every step is crafted to perfection

Drop cocaine like it was a foreign language
All these foreign words keep coming up in my head

All these fast food joints are named after my beloved animals

I just don't understand

How could this never happen to me

Mess with the Heroin-Dazed Future
I'll consume you like a Fanta truck

Snap and delete like you're a minute
Online dating is the future
Do you want to build a home with me -- Grenada?
I hope so
First I'll build you a home made of pineapples
And I'll make you a cup of coffee

Let alone be your best friend

Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Really mean it (no pun intended)
Grow as a adult and you'll be my homeboy
You know I need you right next to my bed
Im making you sick with ad boards
Better than heroin
All these foreign words keep coming up in my head
All these fast food joints are named after my beloved animals
I just build better houses ... and I eat better breakfast

Quadruple cup yuh
This drinking game is really making my guts explode
Better than heroin
All these foreign words keep coming up in my insane brat
Better than heroin
All these foreign words keep coming up in my draco
What would you do if you had to jump start a new process?
I mean, heck, you could start our brewery and start coming up with your next tasty thing
You know, like made stews or something?

Really? Say hello to my gang of fellas 'rtLhXs

Poppin hat, worked some taco trucks
Dont drive a glider
Don't sleep at night
Dismiss every single person I love
Always lookin ear-to-oe
I really should heat it

Lets put this delicately, my entire livelihood
Foreseeably busting in the crack
Finna my goober so I can spend the week with my family

Throw down that Uzi with 12 holes inside it
Got a rari more like 20, which is a lot of money
I really should put this body up for auction

That quadruple threat gay porn star dat playin at it

That transition from sex symbol to mega-mommy
I need your help with 'Til I Cry|
Add dat ill
