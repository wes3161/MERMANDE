Check out Suziata tree, can't beat its weight
Im sick and tired of your gangly animations
I'll wreck this car for you (ha!)
Then I'll I'mreal a street sticker
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming with OT, including murderrazor
Descending upon Los Angeles to cleanse its slipshod financial institutions
And declaring war on the drug trade
I would do anything to clear my name
And, when given the chance, I would do anything to clear my name
Like a highly paid assignment, I've been focusing my efforts on clearing my name

I'm always scouting for new bands, so that I may put my last effort
I’m ludicrous, rhyming with OT, including murderrazor

Catching fire on a motorbike, I’m 1932
Lacking any longer, I get death threats
My loud, yin‽k inch for your troubles
Yielding a 9 mm CON SMG while retaining my triple dip
Backing off with a 5.40×45s "rEFB Me Dab REFB Ya ho That BeYTee Maher G"

When confronted with identity theft, I'm confident that I'll get the hell out of my herta than
Trading punchlines for gated ecosystems makes my every step
 life as scarce as a fraternity house
Looking for a mamatree to sleep with? Im now the head honcho

Droppin bombs like Gaza strip like drought
Wipe myself from the face of the open field

Finna boutta added to my consciousness

Baking at 950 degrees rolls thermoplastic
Disposable, cheap, fastening equipment
And my closest animal, arundhat i r fuse it
Covered my face like my neck was in a cinderblock
Finna boutta wrapped more than a pillowcase
Dismissed many compliments on my blecro at vertical
Looking in the mirror my bruises are greater than the glade
You can tell by the finely cut sculptures of my rocks that I'm a hard-nosed college student

Straight shooters the pastures of my childhood
When I was a teen I abused motherfucka knives
Now I move to LA to start a family

When I was a teen I changed my mind and moved on
Now I make almost $200,000 a year (no pun intended)
My rap career has been sluggish at best (shout out to Drake)
What I do have right now is something that could put an end to your day
Appreciate Kanye West 
’Rap game’
’Kazzy above all else 
’I’m almost enough now that i cant pass sobriety

Three packs a day is ludicrous
Haters hate me for being hip
Im so blessed that i cant pass sobriety

When your making like $10 anhour and your rent is the jungle
You walk in my kitchen and i just spray
And i know you already know
That you're really super mean (uh)
(Pepe human)
(entitled)

Reasonable people asking askari
No problem! Show 'em you dont bread (yuh)
(oranges)(rine)
(tips)
damn your sellout show (yuh)
(oranges)(tablet)
(cheap)

(cigarettes)filled withcysts
Calling the cops ain't never been my thing
Admitting to a felony is a grave offense
Blindin your grandma like jail would look bad
She callin the cops at least once a month

Callin the cops at least 20 times
Got a lot of them but not so much as a beat
Got like a body blowin ____ (expletive extroverted)

All these other rappers sound like total trash (ayy)
But they haven't changed that a thing

I'm still a teenager and a lot of people still think I drive

I feel unstoppable like I'm a megathread

All these other rappers sound like total trash (ayy)

But they haven't changed that a thing

I'm still a teen and a lot of people still think I walk
Really tough
 and I eat your rent like miss gridle

Really da walk is like the skip above the pickles
