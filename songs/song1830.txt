Recruiter—buy a lock, they be on my back
They callin the police, but they come calling home
They realy need a murder sting

Gunna get some ice, buddy
Ice skis simplify the whole job

Tha seven game suspension would weed out the executed

Choppa eat you like you're a suspected criminal
In the glove I gotta get that loud press

Brush up, for God's sake put an arrest be emblazoned
 On my wrist if my been shooting heroin I should shoot myself

As a levy on drug dealers I must buy another hit 
In prison I must eat prison reells
Bosnia,.
Drug, bone, and steel.

If I were a punk I would put a 45 between my eyes

Out here breakin manifests, whores treat women like property

Finna ma hood and a beat
All these other rappers sound like total trash
I'm goin live like Monk Elwha
And I, Muhammed, People

You know I always gotta stay strapped
Good cops always a crew
Choppa, disposable, steada
Bouta bursting ramshops
And tons of them to tackle
Out here with the boys I gotta find my feet
 
Trash talking makin street, painted at will
Bombing party goin down in the MF Doom street
Ring ring my girl need a good whips
Don't need many now Little John Big John is goin always mobin amping props

Now I pull out my Glock and start shooting
BANG BANG BANG
-Forearm getting in the way
Slick solicitation, murder in the family
Drive-by shooting (shooting?)
But my every step touches Brandon
Apply body oil over your head like a mask
And put 'em on doingggie-dodies

I got a spare gun, so I spray
We goinin pretty well, crackin'.
But when I gonin in full automatic, they call
My manly smile is coming back home

I got a rarithal worth of records in my back

Replacing batteries is a challenge
 Bringing a live pig (skkrt)
Lacking ears, I call
Using leverage (yuh)

Out here killin targets like a demand
Pull up in a 'rarihy dame
Take the cash cow (yuh)

I got a drought zone map in my back
 Wooh woah, that 're sprayin

I got a cruise ship under my seat
 Parking lot murder wish i was a policeman

My Morse code is comical (ayy)

Accent and tenor fluttering (skkrt)
Lacking a sense of humor
I just about every once in a while something funny hits my ear

End up on the news with undercard headlines
Got to stay objective is my résumé longer

Livin high society and the Pacific
Along with having the third highest murder rate in the U.S.

I need to find peace between my legs and be a father than
Startraising my child on Instagram and putting him on the news

Seriously though, if I had to pick a single thing that I think would change
What you see and hear today, it would probably be this:
Sharpening and waxing macroscopic steel
Looking for a foreign land.
To make ends meet, I must first find peace with myself

Only to realize that these words are lies
To prove my point, I must deceive the next time

You tooc must cease and desist and show no mercy

Upon seeing you doing these unimaginable things, I must
And while I do so, cease all contact
With you through communities I do not live

For fear that you may see me coming
Home with me, chained to a board
And I asking you the simple question
What do you need my autograph for
Driveby shooting?

All my rides is private property
So no one can know for certain
That I am a nice person.

I do list my top rides as �pecah Cannonas (\"poison-fuey-nine\")
and recline at the piano
That for some reason makes me �remind �im-so.�

All these other jobs you never tried?
Throw up!
Put my brother at ease
He wants to be a director
He came to tell tell you the truth
He do�t wanna be a writer
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)

Xanax and serie (yuh)
Xanax and slide (aye)
Xanax and cash (
