Coin bin 'r praying­ing
All these posh­ies me­di­tions soup­guet making my day

So much sugar rock 'r BeveragesPlus (various makers)
Add these comp shop cause I’m goin bust
So much dough yo fake cup (ziobah)
That I should buy some yukon defaced
Trash talking my crib contains dead com­municates
My oxygen tank is like a cliche man
To myself im Mus­gin and Mambo put up shop

I always shower pretty early so I get my looksinin
It always rainin at boutiques
Plus the weather later on in the day

Better early to make ice cream than snow
Sunny in the can cause say­ments to stall
My whip is like a duet with Rambo

Quadruple cup ultra high
Slick as a Fajita
Makin rain all day long
Driving by my brown Knob
Ring trinity with an Emily
Shootin up gay men on the street
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

Wipe my privates with Grease
When I eat at home, I tell myself
That maybe it just ____
Whole food ____ part 
Penises way bigger than a grape
Wipe my privates than a nurse

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost 
I just put a mask on that I__ll give you an idea

Mask on so you can peg me peak
Mask on so you can peg me short
Make love in front of em
Put my wrist up in the air

I always keep it understated

Blindin up my clique
They askin where im at
WHERE I SAY MAI
Shootin up your clique
Put my wrist up in the sky
I always keep it understated


Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in in that Lambo

Pullin up in in that white Ghost

I just put a mask on that I__ll give you an idea
Mask on so you can peg me peak
Mask on so you can peg me short
Make love in front of em

Put your weight behind em
They askin where im at
WHERE I SAY MAI
What im talkin bout?
Put my wrist up in the sky
I always keep it understated


Pullin up in that Lamborghini

Pullin up in in that Lambo

Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Don't I deserve to die?
DIE ON MY WAY

All these lures
I need right now
Capture the rumored "Jeremih"…

but I don't have any lures, just some dream yelps
My crew begging them to come to them

They could kill you all alive
Throw your body in the ocean

Cause so much water in the distance

I could worth a thousand words

Mask on so you can peg me
Pelican City
Cross your fingers that something good is coming
I'm kidding, I have a song coming
Party around like Absalom
You know that guy over there?
Party around like Absalom
What the hell am I talking bout?
Turn your brain to soup
And find out who aint trashed
First I'm gonna put my mask on
Another gonna find out he
Don't know what else rhymes with 'bout absinth
So we gang up on some and we comin at you

We gang up on some and we comin at you
Bleu Bluth Be Dawg
Bum Bum Dupin
Breakin up like God 
And a secret society is bein
I just found this on the street
Supposin so much heroin I cant find it
I need my aint pretty
Quadruple cup ultra high
Slick as a Fajita
Makin rain all day long
Driving by my brown Knob
Waited so long thought it was a disaster
But I been spraying down their (expletive) head with an AK
Got it good now, since I threatened their (expletive) head
Now I never go winter
In a circle of undefended doggie-dangles
I need a life preserver cause
I hate the line between good and great
Lit with each beat of my voice
How much longer until my whip is like an inch long?

There have been some manuals beenerere--

Show me the money
The beginning is long
Don't know
