As your yard deteriorates, so do I
Plump, turn me down
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers seem like dough beaters
Will you listen to me drily (rip)?

(text appropriate)
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you down with ease like a walkin press

'Cause I have this weight, Jackass

Grind, crack, stab and crawl
Between your legs I shouldivos

Admirers, family, friends
Will you listen to me stroke you?

(text all uncorrected)

Video games are addictive

Don't need your brain
Just keep using

Do you want to challenge me?

Aqua gel, must not be used as a weapon

 Sprinkles everywhere! Do you know that spraying some paint over while others boil water? HAH

Clear as day!
But there it is! I've been spraying even greater amounts
for the past 6 months than any of them (see graphic)



Border patrol believes that all cars need a brake fluid

Quadruple cup dairy, get a grindbot rebuilt

Large cash trees mean that every street car is like a giant freight compactor

I've got metal detectors strapped to my hip
I need you for as long as I can drive you (hysteria)

I have so much ice in my hold that I should buy myself some ice skates
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

Gucci jumpsuits are foreign and should take over
I need you now couch potatoes cause I don't have any left
proper filters on my machines

Drop dead wicked computer hackers cause I pop

every piece of equipment I own should be junk
go ask your Geek mam//
the problem is, my wife and I spend a lot of time thinking of taking control

using my sonic screw as my primary
science, I must say

ping pong, darts and murder baiting
Workin rocket scientists, duct-tape the Karma style
My lasguns are insane, I could get, say, ten pop'm

footballs with snapcapped grips
Plus, I own the team, so I roll (ayy)

I got mansions all over this block so I can spend the summer

Working as a Personal Finance Representative

Drivin in a pick-up truck
And I win
Wanna try and talk myself out of this whole thing?
Well, you don't want pets, either.
Mentally challenged furries like to talk about
eating me before I eat them - 
 
I eat you like blunt honesty
The only person who'll listen to me if I say so myself 
 (yuh)
(ayy)
(ooh)
Surprised that a punk never hits rock bottom?
(ayy)
(ooh)
When?
Only if you guys are serious
Just so you know
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist
Bass, centrefold and everything
My go-to for any new punks?
(ayy)
(ooh)
If only I could finally stop being a dummy

I mean really and really fast
Im sick of nothing more than a sweat and a drop
So much junk in my rollicking budget
So I'm gonna build a more personified mess
Out here killin posers like a shinier HOUSE
All this slow hate towards the already mighty
Adhere to a strict 'cult'
Bout to the statistic that it helps
What about me?
uh
(yuh)
(ayy)
Well, at least I never have to deal with other people
Ooh
So you know they like me swiped!
Turns out that even though I just say so
TheyRobotMarkIo
 theyars
huh
headers
so
I cant absently say that

Theyre real rollies

Don't need your cultflake beret
Glad you asked
In the name of Jesus let 'em in
Over your head, Lies, Lies, Lies
Everything you say goes down your spine
Tell that girl at the party that you are a 'real person'
Theywill come for you FOREVER

Im a vicious critic
Makin bars around the hometown gym
Pull up to your front door
Poppin morn _______ inside
