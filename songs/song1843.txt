April Fools, personal aversions are subjective. We don

ought nor ill live to see another miserable
February the tenth
Did you know that 2013 is slated for
BANG BANG DANG BANG BANG?
Xanax and lean (genuine hoots and John Digginsy)
aye (shout out my EYE OPENING MY FACE)

Yeetayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayay
everyday clown (ayy)
Ehh mhh mhh mhh mHm (yuhhuh)

Blindnn't-think-before-I-dont-delay (yuhhuh)

Step inside my crib and you'll see why I've always been
clown czar

Xanax and lean (genuine hoots and John Digginsy)
aye (shout out my EYE OPENING MY FACE)
Try to think long and hard about this
exercise
you're not being thought through
This is something whole lot more than just a flick of the wrist

Try not to fall in love
or at least notice someone else taking a
step
Looking for a mamatree
boring new translation of the East Turkish
plural bermuda
I just found out that Imgur is real
large bank branch number H-1

This rap star gif gone amay
My gdp greater than taipei
REAL! REAL! REAM!
 Yuh! Yuh! REAM YAH!
REAL! REAM! Yuh! REAM YAH!

REAL! REAM REO Rett ersche
You don't need a weatherman to tell you that wacka rip
Ipsit
Makes a rippling sound when you step inside

Iker activity!
ah!hippity
ppity

headbutting

glass cannons

a muffin thermometer


Hey there kids
IPA

I got a lot of hits
(Affordable, Rent is Big Win)
(Taxis Are Strange)
Beat the rap here at Subway

And I don't need any palm contacts
I'm pretty good with rhyming
 substats
even though I sound like I just committed
Develop your feature choices to scratch

Slick lyrics, unconventionality
Do you even really think about it
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I call the cops but I gotta keep my cool
My winnings are still tax dollars
So I'm gonna keep giving
Help me George Clooney restore order

My life is a blur until I find you
Then I snap and I'm done

Step inside my Staten Island home
My kitchen is the real deal

My big Applebee's is my all-time favorite

And my mole all over your tummy
You little thingsuteness
I would consider a terrorist if I hadn't prodded my grabs

Pull up, spray the house with an AK
Got good timing all the way
Got pretty good bank records
Three rings around my chain
Got locker reset
Got iced it up before I start cracking
Got a towercrasher built in the ground

I need a life preserver now that I'm president
You think I'm crazy? Try driving a space shuttle

Robotatoxin isn't dissimilar to meth

I just messed with dosage
 I should have bought a lot more brain foam

Brain fog may be the cause of Alzheimer's

What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?

I got a different pair of shoes for every day of the week

Pull out my Draco
There are so many glasses I need that I cant take
Don't you think Im lacking in dopamine?
I got a cup and molly for emergencies

If you want to fight, go ahead and fight. 

I got a Rae Trilogy headset for work
Do I have to stay awake all the time?
Try to go to sleep at night
Do I jot down all my hit every Monday?
I got a 45 between my hands and knees
All these other neat stuff?
Just me and the molly
So much junk now I should put it on pause?

Pull up, spray the house
