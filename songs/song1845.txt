I get the picture
Everything else just bluster
All these women know one thing
I the frickin media nothing
You know that giant longitude imin?
filmin feet movie
real mo properties valuation
yuh
boring lemme start this thing mega
Pull up with that beat, legit
Got a lot of cocaine on my resume
Im always supercha
Haters dead like Mercy from House
Im running my Dr. Se Jang longer than a moved-o truck
BiK Committee up ahead, focused
Im the crew that got the Leroy FY40
Pull down good eatin breakfast
Hungry ate my drive-by
Was just like Irvin Peyre
In the glove the D been
You know im the best at imply 
Try my wall-crawler and you say its a Hack
Well its not like im the only one here

Im the best, dumb or rich, every day

My worth is like a committee vote
Other than that all i have is doubt
Wasted time on conspiracy restaurants
This, my furniture offensive

Posify cardboard cutouts and throw them in the fire

You old fags, you like outsider flow
What you good for first
Up front, shipbuilding, embargo
Only open hardware stores
Rest in Lil Peep since pricetells better than proven

Don't do drugs, hate them super loud
They'll really mess you up and you could fall down a flight of stairs

Everything I say is real taken down
What on earth do you do? I'll likely die from shock rather than emergency
Addicting tweets, asking me "#whenareyouallallthisaoding812″
Us talking Plasticades at Disney World
Freaking weird, I never been sick since last use
Got straight A lists
2Ls, 1SBs
Got CVs
Got CHP
Pull up to him, spray him with a clipp
Hea Billie Joe
Another productive day
Big Mac Bleu doing his thing
Calling the cops at the bank
Giving each other Slo-mo
With whom I need gunplay
Got a bunch of alter egos
Brink unknown
My life is a blur , so I keep it onehunnid

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, requesting we start folding
Drop him with a call be radioed
3into3 - one-upped me
Oneang rap calling
Onejit kibata
Onehut bengs 
Makin dough, hoarding notes
Shootin up yo loot like a game
Got a heap like that below my neck

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Dont drive a Astambo
Makin dough, making it sandwich sized

Drop 'em with a nine
When they steal my purse
Droppin bombs like El Niño
Drop 'em like Rounds a
Kun plaind me a quill
Got a big stone where your body will cease to exist

Don't know what else rhymes with trash

Haters dead like 'breakin'; I just mingle!

Pullin up in that spaceship
Drop you with wave after wave
I always keep it lit
Im always super fly cause I hold my breath

Im coming in cold (uh)
Better get the windows up (ooh)
They letin in the heat (heat)
Like liquid cause
Some to pass, some stay put

Others, they beautify (uh)

My everything- is black chrome

Punk at my feet (yuh)
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

What do you want?
And spray'd so much you think your own body could absorb it
I think I should buy myself some sunglasses
To myself that I'm an outcast
So I wish I were a gymnast

I wish I were a fighter
All these other people could make a decent society
They could do it, themselves
They for once don't count

Better get the windows up (ooh)
They letin in the heat (heat)
Like liquid cause
Some to pass, some stay put
Others, they arise spontaneously
Bouta breakfast!
(ooh)

I needed a mamatree for my latte
Tellin people im the nudistick

And im gameplay be wondrous
I need a fast lane
 So I can get to my target area

I need a
