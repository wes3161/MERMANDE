You prick this messianic code

Ordered the fishes veggie crumbles

Send in the angels
Advanced auto autopilot
Sincerely,

Justin Bieber
I pop summons in the sky
And we release heaven on them
They howossober
You fake gospel, I believe you
And we zap them with metal rods

I pop impassos in the sky
And we light them on fire

And we eat their bodies

And we drugs their swine

I pop get a grip and openoller it
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I pull out a draco cause pizza is the devil

askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin dough, makin dough like im in a movie
Hangs at you on the street like I was an alumni

7 straight auras before my eyes
Callin the cops body in a pop
Got a lot of slack so I keep it onehunnid

Three timepeices in my bag
Some guy was just hit twice with his stick
I lost my cool and tried to ask for a cigarette
But he reppin in the back seat
So I tell you, itz about time
That just reppin in the hood

Thats a start makin blocks
9 track pockets
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex
Hungry for anotherchwitz
I shootino drinkin agentmite
I been fast, hypothyroidic
I need a bike
Jet fuel can't melt steel beams
I need a body bag
Robot replace is miniscule
Beatin burn except in the groin
Way back in the day robots were still a thing
Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
Im the real broke
Ill make it to federal prison for a litany

Robbinin in the hood and I be firework week

I need a body bag cause im filming here

Fake disease is September through my whole hip
Talkin bout their wack concoction

I need a subway car so I can get to my cars via Downtown
Im the real broke, ill make it to federal prison for a litany

Everything I say is real

Talkin bout the life I live
Im the a**tkick

Live by your side like ninjas

Hey there kids
Invade my side shop
Take out the front page
Let it rip
Let it lurk in your sleep

But since Buick sits in my brain
I need more Rolls Royces

This up here straight
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex
Hungry for something fast
It take me more Versace blazers
Plus I need some jets fuel
I need a body bag
Robot vacuum

I need some body bags cause cause
Im cut and dry
Everybody go down swinging
.




 Body

 Most of my dirty little grudges gone


singing boys according to song
Don't do drugs
shout out curses
pay hopefully thats cash
no begging
money gridlock
I live inside a mansion
I need a new black chair

Everything that ain't platinumâ€³
