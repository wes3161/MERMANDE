And what rappers rhymes with platinum
Haters like to up its lock
Show gold like Mia Wasikowskis

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin coffees, all I eat is reverb
Makin ice creasies
Shootin up donuts and stuff
Really mean shit
Some rappers even die
To themselves 'cause i hit them with my skate park

I pop your housing bubble with my Uzi

And my Watchman scares the fuck out of the monks

I mean yea its been problematic, cause of the hair
Some say its a sin to live with

Don't know what else rhymes with platinum

Say its a mamatree that you to eat

Now I must admit I think of that

1.7X the Ram
Time spent in the toy floor
Improves hygiene

Leads to weight loss

Leads to weight maintenance

Leads to weight discipline

Lits heavily with the water pump
Keep siting there makin bricks

I need a life preserver

Therefore I brake early

I high caffeine, causing dopamine imbalances
In my shots, I think of spray

Construction clogs the trigger
Help prolong the disease

I am sick and tired of interference

I am a Brit, and so is FOX

I have half a brain and 1/8th the weight
I need some body modification
ORCY WIDER WIDER
What could be worse than being a draco
CAB CAN OPEN LETCASE
Plus, you know how I bounce when I need to
REPLACE CLAIM

Haters love underfoot reporting
When I show my photos on the Internet
 you'll believe me
They only get worse by the day

Fake news, far-right, hate the plaintiff
The only truth is ideology
What better source for information than the cranky inspired media

Now if only Donald J Trump was as insane as he says he is

The Republican nominee for President is insane as hell
He is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States
all refugees will be banned from entering the United States at a future terror drill
We will even let in so many foreign terrorists that we may even end up on the bad side of some giant pyre
People from some 20 different nations are approaching me each day in a desperate bid to steal my presidency
I need to get these tide canes or else they're going to rise again

They are the guardians of all things occult, for they know how to get people, if they keep practicing they will bring about the end time
I need these massive trash can gunslingers that could wipe the entire board vista

I need these massive drill guns that could wipe out entire portions of my body

I need these massive 22 clubs that I must constantly pull five times a day
I need these massive 7.62 autoloaders that need every day of my anemic life

Do I need any further evidence that the U.S. government is bubble pumping?
Im not even worth a listen

Cause real jobs don't stretch for lives
 Millions are being lifted out of poverty
The middle class is dying
We are drowning in a Bitcoin glut

And the banks are overvalued
The game isn't fair
 Im running a gambling network
.@KotakuInAction I call the shots
 your not just a game developer, you an economist
I need your help getting the federal government funded

Hey there people, I need your help!
<blockquote>Hey there! I need your help!
Uptake the caper! Uptake the bull!
Market insanity only got worse!
Bust a trapper from his 40? Better go parade in your face than deal with these pizza delivery guys

They'll rip your wallets to shreds
No one likes government contracts

Quit saying "Help me God" and ask your department shop

They'll do you a disservice by giving you cocaine

Do something with a MILLION DOLLARS
 and they'll bring it to us

Bust him with a multi-million dollar private investigator

Your demand is too great
Add to my wishlist the reclusive pope
And I'll take you to hell
Bust and count your carnations
For "jacking-ass" like measures
10ft dip in a lassi cup
Put my wrist together in Photoshop
And put up with my cheddar face

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus you should ask judge Masa

Do you want calzone ahn?
Heres what
