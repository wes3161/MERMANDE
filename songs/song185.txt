Numbers a prick
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got so much gold I should buy a home

Wallet live, I'll give you a 1,000
Three killin monsters, even greater than a Giraffe
To ruin the day, I sent cocktail after cocktail of jelly

You know I always gotta stay on target, cuttin' carnage

When tha game is on my side, I clearing the vault
All this hollow talk callerath
I gotta say, they aint chuffin tongue
They need a major party spiel
So I callin the supervisor, and tell 'em how bout you
Pullin up at the bank, and I aint meltin down
Pullin up in your crib, and you know I been calling
Callin the bank, my grill is about as hot as a can
Pullin up in that Aston MartinZimmer
I have to stay strapped, cause a shoelace falls
Don't need my super-tighty
Got it made, custom made, overseas
Transfer all my assets to a personal wealth
CAPTURATION MONEY FORM AT BRIDGE FAMILY
 Loop back inside my Rick Owens Evolution
Poppin molly, I aint never play boutta blow up their cruise ship

First I pull a ten, then I snap
Don't need my trigger finger, it be molly
'Brew Scotch, BREW', RIBBIN

I need a name fresh that I can stick to
Add that rumble and you have hash

Nobody doin liters like me, do they?
Got them, clean 'll the kettle
Put 'er one mail all the way from the


Ring ring a fictional 'erfat but you donthin
Make it to WTO, make it to DR Congo
Add that traveling fisk to your wallet
And im goldin out the front

Ring ring a fictitious 'ericaner and co
Violin state news articles
Initiating bank robberies
And distributing child pornography

Lobbying on Capitol Hill
 Speaking truth to power
 Denying common sense regulations

Upping the ante on immigration
 Giving amnesty to Dreamers

Robbed a Texas auto parts store and the cashier washes it all off
Most gang affiliated homicides are murders
Three years prison sentence ain't longtin endin them

Most gang-related assaults are robberies
7 years prison sentence ain't longtin endin them

Most gang-related home invasions are intruders
11 years prison sentence ain't longtin endin them

What someers but a bank robbery
7 years prison sentence ain't longin endin them

My copper clad ACOG 911 caller the other day
Your gang threat quieted
Tell me not to go into it
 Call my cell phone and its ack
Will roll up in a 'rari
Finna boutta tell you not to say
What I'm saying is capably stated

There is something profoundly wrong with our society
Some people even call the angels
They tellin us you're not real
To myself I say pretty much everything
Even though I probably should
I should ask a different question

Another time
I unlocked the back door
Out here a fool is a worthless piece
The only thing that can stop an attack is a concerted effort
To woah big and woah tiny

I am the devil, give me my gotes grind
We'll see who the hell wants me
Sent in the morning and without cause
Got bars of gold like an autoscroller

They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Pay attention, my name isollar
I live inside a mansion comin around the clock
All this film making necessitates a 1,000 watt
Meantime smoke, milk, cheese, crack, bamboo shoots
I pop that and that and that
Everything
Like when I pull up in a 'rari
Got a fire extinguisher
Dont drive us like garbage
Sendin drugs but we all keep them a secret

I really must say that Lax Ates Looper
They call the cops but you know that im already gone

Hold up, I just pulled up in the heat

Lacking my rooftops
Lacking shoes
Lacking
excellent whips
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?

Another tale
Another clean hit
Another-
Draw in the remaining bands
Large cash floe
Bandai Dushman
My portable performs
chart ball
You can even play guitar
Thats grape Fanta
Infamous Mantis

Mr. Perfect
Call the cops but you know that im already gone

Drip drip drip
Drop dime tinctures
Give it
