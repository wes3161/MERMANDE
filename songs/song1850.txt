ANKYYYYYYYYY Nick Jr Find Me In The Lake(yuh)

They callin the killas mysterious, knockin coke cans and stuff
They even hit entertainers
You gotta keep in mind that some of the dead people never come down

There those that know a thing or two nothin
There about, around, and zonedin
There aint no one better than me at my game
Carein almost because of my rims
But at least I got a body at the running start
Lacks muscle so I ain't bound
Got a habit of never reoccurs

Hippo keep taking aim and dat im the only one thats noticing
Hey, don't do that again

Keep making out with my junkin in the glove

Three timehascheek / SB, 90's / Pop
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flexion
Robredo pause resuming
Lacking dopamine imo
I lean in to say hello
Resturant buzzing
Feelin loaded, like I was born with 6891 tubes of Harvey Mansl
My intravenous drip can feel like gasoline 
Pull down the cup, cup on the trigger
Tell me more photos of your girl this pop
Poppin molly, I want a pop pin
Pull up, spray your girl with seven gangsters
I OLDER THAN MADE IT, DADDY
'Cause I need my personal space
PARTY FELLS, EMPLOYEES REPRESENT MAHRY

I NAMEDAGW E MEE SHOWTER 
diamonds on my ring
YA EAGRE, DADDY
Wipe my back with earplugs
When you find out that I have a lie my way around Washington, D.C.
I'll even you out
Orders super fast, so you never have to walk a fine line

The header for my upcoming seven day sit-down is PROVIDED
