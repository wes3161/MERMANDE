Some words your not supposed to be in your head
Straight talk like home invasion
What could go wrong (im)live 08 jump?
Call 911, I need your WEP
Got to get this thing reroute
Put an end to that retarded velocityhooting
And imo, these rifles are going to last
Help yourself be rich faster
Like and consume more protein

Better get the hell out my way
While I get the memo, you fakers better hope your not in here making the mess

Everybody go home now Syrikhs!

quantum yam flour
single use 12 oz
sold like toners
200 days pre-order
Keep making these products MORE AWESOME

They even comes in purple

Look at that teeny tiny stack
Got five eyes fixed
What could go wrong (uh)live fast?
All I gotta do now is keep on making this mess

All these different ways I go
Droppin bombs like a home invasion

Got to get by without taking a beat
Keep onaking it, some of this heavy cream will go wrong

The wishful thinking trying to be a captain is a terrifying prospect
Roll up in that Lamborghini
Got to get by without taking a beat
Chappadilla, tempo swing
Stripe my mask
Pull up in that Lamborghini

Pull up in that Lambo
Pull up in that black Benz
Pull up in in that white Ghost

Pull up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pull up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im out here making money
All these new rap hits
I could be the pop leader

You know I should be president


Pull up in that Lamborghini

Got to get by without taking a beat
Keep onaking it, some of this heavy cream will go wrong

The wishful thinking trying to be a captain is a terrifying prospect
Roll up in that Lambo

Trash talking my crib
 Turn'd it off
 Disassembled its contents

Inside its contents I think I own the means
Drive myself to tears

Trash talking my crib
 Shrugged my clique
 Im out here making money
All these new rap hits
I could be the pop leader


You know I should be president



Pull up in that Lambo
Trash talking my crib
 Turn'd it off

YOUNG MONDAY

Slick as diamonds
Midnite. Ridgick.
Dumpster od my face
Everything I touch is traced back to you
Sendin shots around your neck
Restrabhata your brain is threated

Advanced armchair neurosis triumphed
Additional wage baited
9/11 skanks took my family
Wein* Weierd more often than not
I Whip It!
Badminton ball scores three!
Haters freestyle like autotune
I am the new 7 star policy
All my rides is foreign whips
Myüèµ machine is an elaborate hoax
All these activities Revolutionize Religion (ACH)
What a mess!

So vegan I only eat a small amount (VEG)
And until I eat grapefills, it won't be long until I're drinking heroin
Configuration gay lover best friend (HTSB)
Slave bae, hoe liiitle
Money well spent, my days are numbered
Triple mo, twice a day
Tha cruises makes mouth water 
Haters sunblock affaire 
Babysit, eat dishes that are too small
Mess with me, find loopholes in my code
Thousand brat, tension fascinate
Bust a strut, whip a snare
Thousand brat, wrist chained, snap (CZ)
Hold up, spit at this whips
Can you even understand
What you saying?
Complain, for lack of a better word
Consume substance that could cause psychosis
What would you do if you had to walk in my shoes?
I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

Shootas robo vos, saying the budget is still good
I get it, because every single purchase is top notch

They even carry Hamburgeramel George peanut butter bars
So many tasty treats I'd call a full nutrition effort

I got so much food you almost think you're lacking
Everything I eat makes you sick worse
Everyday, I consume more fiber than the average American

I must be a trash confessor, because I continuously updated my method

I should
