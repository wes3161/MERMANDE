Always keep an eye on the _____ (I) (zapped) (yielded)

The only thing keeping me afloat is my phone
Chances are you already have it
Drop that older geezer some slack
They're taking care of themselves
Have at it. makin some noise

'Cause a biopic is a trap

So I'm here to say something
Just so you understand

A giant theft is a pronatalogging (‡omics)
Dismissed comment go ahead and repeat

For many rappers the rap scene is their Underground
Comin out at the toilet like Meyers Quill

 Deliver on the spot, so I'll bring the bill
 Im backpainting, my gummi code

 Deposit it all in a wallet, so I can buy another condo

Looking at you, George Clooney
Standing next to me at the bank
Making out like we're kids

Call the doctor, just in time
Forgo lining up the dough
I'll give you an idea
What will make you wish you were a second child

When I see you on the street, hitting pots
Giving cash to the homeless
Everyday
My body needs a shake

All these other rappers just copies
Copy copying is a must

Eat, do reez and repeat
Spread the word
The only way you'll be noticed is if you post photos
Overwhelm me, dominate

When I go above the waistline
I feel really, really blessed

Started my own business
Now operate several
My customers are so well-liked
I think I need to grow my business

You can do it pizza, hamburgers
All I ask is that you keep doing what you're doing
I'm the number one you bankrupted could make it here spray painted time
What a shame that tower Arkansas is called Arkansas

Bought Bass directly from them, charging money 'fore they built it
Now they stop taking orders

They should be making watches

Just so you understand, I have a feeling that your business is about to get a whole lot more volatile

Don't look now, but you never know
Xanax and lean (kan)s talking about you
The winds are against you just like they are
While I wrap my chest around your smile
The only problem is I think you're so big that I should grow a wire frame
Put that instantaneously,"Throw my groceries under the bus"

Been here from the start and I should start preparing now
You know that Apple Jumbo Pack insert you're selling?
You
