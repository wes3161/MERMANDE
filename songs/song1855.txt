Driven by somebody never see coming
Jet fuel can't melt skis melt products
So how come new cars are coming in at ludicrously cheap pos?
In a massive fraud, real or imagined, Tesla is selling you pretty good 
So how come you doubly lacking in the necessities
And why am I feeling rather blessed?
I mean look at me!
Just kidding - I have more cash in my back pocket than any captain in the Pacific

They're worth more than a highway robbery

What would you do if you had to walk in my shoes?
I got a girl called Mona Lisa and she like call her. Â 
We cut short my nap about an inch before I start to realize that she's already gone
I need a home health monitor

Tell her you can't find me on the street
She'll find out that you're not in debt

I need a lift and I don't have one now that I think about it

Someone strip-searches me on the street (accomplice)
I start to feel better
 Maybe I should put my headphones on
 They know what you're thinking: I can sing!

I start praying that I'll find peace in myself
I start taking care of myself

I really need all these pills
Rest in Lil Peep

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
 (impatient)
They'll really mess you up (epilepsy)
Ask your doctor right here (side note - im really really sick)

And he'll tell you to get well before you take any actions
Always look in the mirror (ferocity)
Always look in the mirror (control)
 Always keep me at a distance (confident)

You know that must be how we roll
