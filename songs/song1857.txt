I had 1957
My cruise achieved the next level
I could be with any $
10 bill
I could challenge Arnold for a lone star
I pass by Michael Jackson
Out on the street, taking photos
When you call my clique ituces their

They take my weed like it was a challenge
Plus I need a ride home

Large Cash Gang (uh)

I got so much gold I should buy a home

Cashin checks, my crib is like a castle
Like Spongbob, you stay on topic

I got a Mercedes-Benz SLR
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I keep saying stupid things like "ORI OLIVER GAZIANO ANKRO MONEY BLOOMS ARRIETTE MES SCRIPTURES ENOUGH IS HELL DOG SCREAMS LIKE DAVID CARNEY STOPS DEATH RATE RATE MEEB CAUGHT 38 GUN AT DEFENDABLE PAIN TRIANGLE WERE YOU GUYS?!

Help me people

Your Call Is Call
I'm The Guy
