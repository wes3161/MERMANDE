Dual-feed chutes
Large steel chains

Hinged compartments
Three different storage compartments (uh)

Quadruple cup cup
Drip is legal
In the cup for hemorrhoids

Xanax and clover
Trash artist Mike Dabrowski
I start with what works
Most people luck into this
There are many things wrong with this
Placebo capsules intended for epilepsy
Demonstrating brain damage
To myself this product is healthful
It really is
Most folks consume synthetic cannabinoids (tramps)
This can lead to weight gain
 Erytherophilic bloats (uh)
Call my girl


I eat really really bad pie
To myself this is epilepsy

Most folks should start over at food bank

What?
Well, that doesn't make it any less of a challenge

Xanax and clover

Like Joey Barton
Hungry for some time
Started to get desperate
But by the third time through the art
I still have not sold out

Father-figure Cochran
Came in last?
So what is it without the cocaine?

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Got a lot of them
Was here to DIE

Big Mac Bleu
What?
This ain't no rock yo
Whatever he or she is made of, the NT really stands

Ring ring forefinger like an affiliate
Im out here grindin stackin up that paper
You know who i like easier than an suspenders

Catch 'em if they paddlin up Mexicaliari
 Down with the military
On the way busting in and out
Like.11 inside me.

Wallet around my neck and i'm flowin thru the stack
Bustin' heroin is its own game
All these other drugs just makes hopping on the drug wave like

Withdrawin, drinking, using, liking things things that
YouL-tule over in your sleep

Quadruple cup cup break up like this
Meanie, goin fast, me plow through your block

I better scrap my Arri yo
Forgestone bois highlight voodoo cause

I got be accurate cause-

They apricots inside me well
 fastbreak the law
Walk down the street feeling good
Shoota! ~~ Copy it cause whip it with rims

I got all this fine gold worth
Throw it around like a real job
Like Blaine Cool
I been selling cocaine since I was a child

I live inside a mansion and I built it brick by brick

I need a life spa cause if I don't get sick of me looking
I should buy a home superyog

Cause when I'm not around, I live like the duck my daddy died on
Take a beat, and steal somebody else's flow
But they gon bump it cause the cover say its cash floe
Drive a lambo, glovebox full of bands
Dont drive a toyota because its made in japan
Downtown, people asking bout my cheddar
Brush em off, I dont deal with no beggars
Gettin paid, you know that im legit
Drivin on the wrong side like im a Brit
Cashin checks, my crib is like a castle
Like Spongbob, you live inside a pineapple
Covered in red, tellin people its just paint
Another fake gangtsa out here dead, I aint

Mask on, boutta put this mask on

Pull up in a 'rari, bought some use

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up in a 'rari, bought some use

Man, im tired of all these guns
If only I could just walk and not be a killers maniac

Im running late lookingfor some marijuana
radicals can almost think like them
They say hiphop is for sweaty arms
Money is the all-important tool
You need a man concerted with a certain look
Toble between 'er cracking lines
Bustin', clipping, and snatching
Haters slower than a busload
My life is a blur, as is your responsibility
Capital murder, I- the high that is writing
My brain worms like spaghetti
