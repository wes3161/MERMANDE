Ca$h Floe and i sit in the stands all gameyy
We should at least put on some black lip service

All these rappers rapping about how hip hop is trash
They even beat up on my way home

They need some body bags in my rearview
Try to all the wrong bars and you wont see us

Quit trying to rap and spend better days in a cell
Cause cause I really need all that space inside me

Better start by rehashing my all time stupendous rip floppin scams

propoday sanctuary and we ancintly exit the
deportaton

Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pull up in that spaceship

Got some really gabby bands on my wrist

Pullin up in that spaceship
They callin the cops but you know
