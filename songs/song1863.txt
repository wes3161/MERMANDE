(ayy)
Hlah mayier roll me dead
through the rear-view mirror

(ayy)
body bags full of roman gothic detailers
paying high rents in the area

Earning money doing illegal things
ours is the only legitimate business
in Chinatown

Hi there walleted, $5 bills in cash inside my purse
Calling the cops your aint cheap
Im out here killing yelpers so they jerk off
You gon find out real soon that Im nothin to mess with

License plate YB-12D-HIP-AH
Chinatown crime is overkill
Bout to the death over here cause they find my cigarettes

'Cause a BOP found my wife's body
Drip drip drip drip
Drop ya with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Lets roll this roulette pin
Add this to my shake queue :')
Got a scene to blow your cover
End up on the news, doing the dishes
Trashing the cops a billion
Even though I just told you not to track me

I still keep coming back to you By the hundred you, hell even you
I mean it! I could write more people's books

Bout to the max, like 20,000 copies
I could sell a whole line of body bags
You gon find out real soon that im nothin to mess with

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies, each day of the week (gang gang)
Poppin molly, you know i never sleep (no i dont)
Got money, money money money (large cash)
Straight shooters, you know we we aint funny (kevin hart)
Your girl need vitamins, i give her sunny d (nutrients)
She aint your girl, if she coming home with me (large cash)
Number 1, hottest in the street (heatwave)
Lit as hell, like we drinking gasoline (exxon)
Pull out my Draco, spray it to the beat (gang gang)
Iâ€™m always cool, but I still bring the heat (goldbond)
200 thou, for that Actavis (codeine)
I am so loud, like an activist (large cash)

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene

Lets roll this roulette pin
Add this to my shake queue :')
Still get it, each day of the week
You know I never sleep (yuh)

Everything about myself that you think is normal
I'm special and you're not
It got a lot like Randa Boutis (yuh)
Boutis Ms Versace (sace)

Style flaunted, every single one of its releases
Rollup tights, you know I'm on the money
Lets do it again, for real
With my latestbie, the Floe
Lacking the dominant subculture, I rap with a different, snappier crew
Forever obsessed with my sounds, they'll never make it to Radio City Music Hall
Fail like a man at night, ready to rock the board
Now my only rival is the Best
5th in the East, West, & Central
I'm the number one you gotta beat the odds

Everyday if
