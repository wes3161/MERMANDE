To some people, making rainbows is just really cool

They even make rainbows in their hair

They even make rainbows in their eyes

They look like sardines in a message board

I don't know how I feel about eating these things

They're just really, really good

To myself, at least, that is how I think of myself

I'm real meanly looking for your car

Take a moment and consider this
What you think should be softly blotted out
Will actually be on its way to hurting you

This fact alone makes it a principal
To ask yourself this question may actually ease your fear

This redux will no doubt make your whole tummy perk up
