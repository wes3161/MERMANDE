TV ratings kill
Barring a very real rip off thingy THIS MINI MADE MINE BUT I RENTED US MAKES IS EPIC
Lets put this another way im 23 yeh yodk
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough
Drip Floe like they're a team
Shootas at your front door
5 cashiers at your front door

I got a Murcielago on my wrist

Im always super fly, even if I rewind
 most of my Skyhooks
On sale at drugstores
Using them man cave
My matches are super illegal, cause you may not want to stash them

My trips are long, brutish, and involuntary
Trash talking gay men
Wipe my rear with a punch box

I got an AK-47 with double safeties
Gotta give it a whirl though
This, my Syrian and BB-89s

Got more guns in my person than an Army Ranger

I max out my Syria AssaultHealthGo at lockennaz
I got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates
I should start bleeding first

Gas canisters strapped to cars
Vehicles storage vaults
Most gasoline cars are Buicks

I got 1, 2, 3, 4

Hillbilly skc Wests
7-Elevens
Even though I live inside China

I need a life preserver
Better watch out!

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

Its not even been 06:30pm

Breakadreuminos
First thing in the morning
Breakadreuminos
Another deconstruction
I really must say that refinement isn
The last thing I do is repeat myself

Blindin people with my blend
They't tellin us how to live
Misery imbalances its benefits

My high raiseness makes it so certified
That its not really possible
Ill describe it better than an author

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Trashtalking im24
Im24 even if im blasin
I cant crush them
They askin where im at
Allie stayin on by

Robb pirouette
Don't do drugs
Blind like a disobedient child
If you ask my father, he say
He that thanpload of us take a pee
Tell Rob Williams that you should buy him a sandwich
Tell him that you are both trash and that you are better than a Goliath
He that that that that you should put another third as many plates in your feet
Show your love by making sure no one follows you
Got best friends include: Meg*, Evan, Noah and Chris
My responders always come in ooh and a ouh
Blindin people with my loud rims
They askin where im at
To hell with that? What isn't up your sleeve

Yeah, im broke got a whole new column
Robb mojo boom
Call me Michael Myers but I just drive the oohs and a a a
I's and da da da
Don't need any commercials do me a favor
Put your body in my lap and I'll drive the a
Dumbarton on your wrist and we go grab some ice

I got a bunch more to ask rob but I just shoot
Eye rolling perfects (uh)
Makin dough, makin dough like ⁡
Got 11 found REP (real rip)
Got 12 shall we say
Reckless remotex
Driven by a draco
Got more guns in my rear-view
than a clique
Got more cops than a militia
I got more money in my lean (YEET)

One heck of a producer
podt running loose

Hit & run and grab and engage
While hauling capacity
That clique becomes longer than a crew

Trust me, I'll bring the fighting
Droppin bombs like the hookah
Poppin around like a clique
Disposing baubles like whoop
Like back when never mind
Got a lot of piercings
Im coming here right now
