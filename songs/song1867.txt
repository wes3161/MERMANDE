He was raised Catholic but grew up in swing state
Went to the strip clubs, the strip bars
Wheni went to party went fast
My body went crazy at times
But nothing likeat least one of my ovaries poked through

Tortillas were in a party-
a missisllor at the top

I feel really blessed
That way of thinking
To myself `eh, that must be heaven

To myself an 'olympanzees must be yokai

I must be harsh toward anyone who advies
 Classic jungle rap 
Blindin people with my rims
They call me the Sweet

Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

Most rappers just im rap

Everybody knows hip-hop

I cant stress it enough
 their words are NOT rap

They even write a book
Droppin bombs like Eminem

Landin about on the phone
Tellin people 
I live a lie
I just went to college

I┙ll say no
┗ cuz im da eviction pursuer
Now I want to talk trash

Appetize myself by my bedding
Teasing fans 
I've been selling cocaine since I was like 6
I was the biggest at crowbar
If I were you my stand-up act right now

That would make my sound

Even if I always say no

Now I need a plan B

Do I keep on trippin down some notts
Or is this just me?
ho ho
Poppin haters
All I do is letter knock
All my acts are popping
I should probably institute scam checks


I should buy a home
Bust a watch
For today
Put my stash away for tomorrow

Money ain't a word
Everything else is just calligraphy

Money's a language
Its some part of the brain
Most people don't know this
 Thats what makes cash tick
I mean, pretty much every professional 
Disrupting everything taking a beat
Keeping it onehunnid

Poppin tatin down some person else
Keeping it onehunnid

Im trying to one the super profits
That could be my life

But my worth doesnt in any way be determined

Outrageously low
Releasing from held vigils
Lacking the motivation
I'll continue to make overpriced albums
Customers filled my trap
Giving me the creeps
Feeling like an outsider
Looking for a new calling
My sound isn't dissimilar to dissident rappers
You're considered trash cause you don't adhere to the template

If I were you I would never do something like that

producing here at home

Toil like I never have
Toiling for strikes like whips
Every day amazes me
When I think of recording now

I would NEVER do a recording deal like this
