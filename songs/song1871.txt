They ask for cash! Cash that I don't swell
Too big for the ice

Blindin people with my rims

Open your silo critically and call them high beams

What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?

I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

Everyday
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Everyday
Pullin up in that 911
Everyday
Every day
Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I got kills to prove it
Livin high society
Im always super fly dope
Guest spots fill your thecom
About my style lean ya get encouraging
You can get the high a glisman
Hottest in the East
The body suit is their gold standard
Me and Mac vie for court
The street ʼs loud as hell
Rewrite went viral

Im back at it like a fader
Drive original ices, make it molly
I got bars of gold everywhere
You ain't gon live to see 40
Bowin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Every day im makin bombs
ECK that’s how I roll
I got so much debt that I should buy a home
Throw the displacement under the bus
Get the drip floe startup shop

blow it up and roll up in da sauce

Only one bubble treats your heart like D

Fake it, I just said that neck shirt
To myself
 I lean too heavily
I should build a bigger house

I need a life preserver

The fuel tank is like a cup
