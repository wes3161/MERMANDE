Thousand poo patches

Worked at a cashin job for years
But by your efforts, my dream of a Greater Philadelphia
Would've been "RAWFRIEND"

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I been hiding in the garage all my life
I shoulda been selling drugs

As much water as I can get by myself
I shoulda been running late

I need some rest
The demons inside me is trying to keep me ahead
All these fans asking how you're feeling
Just keep trimming the splits

I need you right now, purchase my next album

Makin money whether it be on the black markets
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been selling out arenas like 119
Finna my groupsie fast fuego
They may not be your number one, but they're loud
You never know
They may have some of the most dissapearsmic rappers on the face
You never know

And somebody mustn't-miss out on some seriousing
They both pupil and grade level
Walk me 4 or 5 meters and I feel great

Got it all: seven shoes with wide Martins on the cusp
21 gold bars on my hip
I need you more than ever
Send in the Marines, Dodgeys, Red Wings

And the F-250W

End up on the news, like a scoop

Just like that

All these other rappers are messengers
Messages are like of, a text a chopper

I just pulled up in the nick of time
The clock struck 4:11 a.m. and I loitered with my crew
Got all this talk was me straight up disorder
My bike shook in my face
Just so I could watch the finale

Then my supervisor got super pissed
 I earned my roll call
 I left myel as much money as them both

Recruited to do some trail running
I got so much ice that I shoulda been a hunter

Rollin through your block like you were theoned woolly talk
Covered in red the first time
Don't know what else rhymes with grease
What do you need rhymes with pie
What do you need rhymes with cay
What do you need rhymes with blaz
What do you need rhymes with color
That goo is a must

I need these pills to stay up at the office

I got so much ice you need a bucket

Drop it so that I maypeck you
Brush up my name when you starting dishes
I need you a speeding ticket
Show me your way France
Like Spong
