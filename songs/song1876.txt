You Know Me Better than an Actress
Livin high society but I don't sleep
Cuz every day im MUTANT MEGHECTH
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that car yeah its a Lambo
Pullin up in that sofa like snakes
Drivein so much without a seat belt
I cant roll

So much for deep discounts
Music makes me wanna die
Deal me a small mistake and I gon
Down the fairness lane I often fold
And so much liquid start a brawl

I cant logo that tongue
Out front I should lean
I should look like a diss
Out front I should lean
Lit as hell, yelling at the top of my lungs
I want to kill you but I cant get ahold of you

Pull up in that Lamborghini

Pull up in that Lambo
Pull up in that Lamborghini
Throwin up in that trunk I should lean

Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see
Hella grape juice, clear immunity
Looking like I could take a life
Looking at you from the high slot
Pull up in that black Benz
Pull up in in that black Benz
Pull up in in that body
Livin high society but I dont sleep

Cuz every day im MUTANT MEGHECTH

Pullin up in that Lamborghini

Pull up in in that Lambo
Pull up in in that trunk
Pull down my stairs
Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see

Hella grape juice, clear immunity
Lacking dopamine, I need your liqueur

I use on top of coffees, drinks it so good I cant pass standard sobriety

Pull up in that black Benz

Pull up in in that black Benz

Pull up in in that body
Livin high society but I dont sleep

Cuz every day im MUTANT MEGHECTH

While trying to be mellow, I pull out five time's worth of poetry
Do you think you're worth it? Because I've collected some of pop's best memories

I use on top of coffees, drinks it so good that I cant pass standard sobriety

Pull up in that black Benz

Pull up in in that black Benz

Pull up in in that body
Livin high society but I dont sleep
Cuz every day im MUTANT MEGHECTH
While making ice cream, my brow is becalmed with dew
My mind is blank, making out with somebody else

I do this a lot, talking trash

Lived this rap song before I even started mixing

I am so much more than a rhyming dream

I am the best

Lived like a piece of shit since I was much younger

My whole being is watercolor

Look at all these platinum plaques in my childlike eyes

I need these jobs
 Plz keep trying again
Will you do for me what I say that
In honesty, I would never do that


Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see
Hella grape juice, clear immunity
Lacking dopamine, I need your liqueur

I use on top of coffees, drinks it so good that I cant pass standard sobriety

Pull up in that black Benz
Pull up in in that black Benz
Pull up in in that body
I am so much more than a rhyming dream
I am the best
Lived like a piece of shit like Spiera

please

I use on top of coffees, drinks it just fine
I need clouds for base
Add that paid pegasus thing to my lit
Thanks so much
You really are a crew
I need you more now that I start plotting

Father for God, and hell, Jesus
First we shall possess these two Galileans
First we'll fill them with like freight
Third we thunderclap like a band
And we an aasai flatter ourselves

We an an an an an an an that a trawl the yard

And we an immerse myself in a recent

Ivy Hilla Crocs Make a Man Rich Again
They May Not Know It
Walk in this, okay puppet, I'll put my finger up my olfactory chain
You know that there's always going to be a catch
And that if you hide behind a clear lens
That somebody else will piece the hat
And that if you keep making money
 That person will pass out on the street

That if you don't keep taking drugs
 Then the only person who can beat you in a fight is me
