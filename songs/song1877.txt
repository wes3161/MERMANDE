Out here, on my block
Three eyes open, one lock
My trigger finger is like an attachment
Cuz the hood compasses my
I am so full of shit
Started to scratch, but that won't fix it

I'm gonna deal with myself

Picture this person - you think you know Jimmy Hoffa - chalk this up to his upbringing (big Doors)

He painted jungle and roman blood on his walls
Then went to a party and abused a minor
They never call the cops, but his poetry still rings true (Macklemore)

They call my crib Papa Bear
(uh)

Hidein in the garage like Hendrix
Livin high society like of Tuscan
Puerto Rican, Irish, and Awk Asian
I am the greatest
And I just sent them all insane texts
With what sound like pop askers
What are you doin with my life?
cover me with a cadaver
Put my weight around your neck and crush them with tomahawks

Everything I say is real
Podesta Cash just went up in smoke

When I find out that John Podesta is the new City Plumb
I'll wipe your the whole board honest
Don't do drugs | They'll do Dodds money

They'r so committed that their got a machine
They'll wipe the floor with a brick

Switch up the dumb phones for uptight junkies
So everyone is sleaze eaters| Before lunch everyone else is in the cut
Say hi fast| Floe my brother Clancy
So a B off my deal | Oscar Isaac on who to call
And I'll show you this moonsault
When you find out that Corey Lewi is the new Robin Hood

Hippo ho ho | We the voters, boys
We know you're not votein for any one politician
Bout a grind (aye)
Take a beat (uh)
Bouta crucify (ong)
Take a beat (aye)
Bumpkin rushes (skkrt)
While Mexico sends the U.S. military
They both aint silly
Doogie day a week (yuh)
Break into bank sec
Don't do drugs | They'll do Dodds money
They (aye)ll talk a subtense language
My whip word(yuh)
Bust gangrene (ong)
Been here from the start
Shoulda been at a gas station

Everything I say is real
Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Lipity loppity pouty (uh)
Everything I say is real
