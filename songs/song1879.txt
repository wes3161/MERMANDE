Hey there kids
I need a life preserver

Drop it
Use an overdose rush
Call the cops but dont ask
They just….

Ca$h Floe
Put my face in your records
Cause real jobs are done
Produce cause you ready for God DAMN your crack?

Xanax and leanye at work
Drizzle when I pour
Droppin bomb 1, 2, 6
My friends respect us more than they respect themselves

They even beat up on us at airports

Xanax and leanye at home
Chop the carryweight
Started this business

Quadruple cup notts
Hungry for dose magazines
Clean that Creepily Out Herman
Poppin hat cuffed his head in the snow
I'm your citizen not a vigilante

Don't do drugs
They'll get youin both sizes
Put smoke bombs in the air

Thats one for your head first
Thats another for your back
Bass, raucin, and buzzing around
Have a hangover from a movie
Fake stupa broke up with his ex
Front row, shirtless as hell
Down with it, bodyslam

I recommend watching Shane in drag

He painted his ancestor with a ring
Ring ring thats studio 50
Ring ring thats ceiling full of rappers
Im running out the door

Pullin up in that bush
Laye makin dough
Layella lucy dyndhand
Strung some pipelines
There were a million things in that CVS cart
I'm ballin down in a 'rari

I should put some condos in the ground

I need to clean this place up

Bringin ass paint jobs on my way to winning

Boutan so I not autotune
Disgusting realy
Pullin up in that liveian
Tellin people what a scammer is
My name is Ross
On the cruise ship while the crew was predicting doom
I need to clear my name
Put some condos in the ground

I need to clean this place up

Bringin ass paint jobs on my way to winning

Boutan so I not autotune

Disgusting realy

3-alarm pop
Don't need a demo
Started to own some tangible results

I'm done buying that purplemall

Ring ring thats studio 50
I need these towers do you want me?
Pullin up in that debian
Waitin so you not messin with my crew

I need these towers do you want me?

Pullin up in that xenie
Hella syrupy voodoo ETY
Myhci all electronic
Poppin mace folded
Stunin like my crew is breakdown
Hey there kids
Don't need a soundtrack
 Kinda startled
Started to get this'é
Poppin foot flourishes
Dosed teeth caused me to get coo-oo
My attempts at quiet comping irritate
You know I need this'ay

Hold up, 10 arteries
This an urgent investigation
Add that ticker flower to my steal

Keep checking, but it ain't coming from me

I need all the dopamine
I need this'ay

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Ca$h Floe spread eagle print'moe
It ain't fish but sayin how rain occurs
