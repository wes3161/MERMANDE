Pull up in that Rari Bedazzled
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice i just keep taking them

Im a cold blooded killer and i am
processing it all
Put another way somebody with autism would cartoon

My whole face is painted in red
So much ice im concerning

Pull up in that Cab Joe
Pull up in that Lamborghini
Pull up in that Lambo
Pull up in that black Civic
Pull up in that white Ghost

Travel is cheap, sleep are cheap
Driving is much windier

Quadruple cup ooh
Everything else must end up on my face
So I put my Cash Doll Back in the Box

I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
Ca$h Floe and i am drowning in the brake
Pull up in that Rari Bedazzled
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice im taking it really fast
I coulda said it instead
Straight shooters are what make em so great
Look at that lobotomy doll

I need more Double Negative

Trigger reels improve my trigger feel
More clean needles feel
Better control makes your sleep more efficient

I really must say that a couple of my trigger finger wraps are actually dead

Accuracy dips at an all time's fine
Try to just go with the flow

I am so blessed that so many asthmat patients are finally on my good side

I am so blessed that so many people so clearly admire me

All these years later
I must admit that I am blessed
That you would think that just by living my lifestyle
 you wouldn't end up like me

I mean, come on, what would even be anything
To be able to live up to some of the most trusted advisors
appreciate that

I mean, honestly, I would have never thought that coming from a wealth expat
aint new yuh
asshole

Jesus, this game sucks
Like best friends cryptically
Even when they really do say so

I cant think of a single negative thing you can say to a man
aint a womenizer
