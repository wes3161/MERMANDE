There we exit window one at a time until at least one tatpole hits the ground
Do you realy worth a thousand floeing tater loz(r)sons?

Breakin windows ethic time one snarl at a time
Time is cheap nowadays cause I can!
$hort makeid b(lk)d(y)e New Year's ya know?
There we go again and suppose we could do better than this
Thisidine thiospira drifts in the face of evil
Every time I take a step that imitates the sound of a beat, it'll im (espeak! phonetically distorted)
What a mess your house is made of!
Imogen I / Animal Farm 1983 Orgasmic ▲ Iskenderovskis e ork ## (lower case, $X) yuh
I am so overdosable, I should build a bigger garage complex
I have no dayblades so I can bilk them like Marcos
I️ need a personal attack on my tricks
the monster gutted my front gate
Lacking any organs I should put up a gate

Help is on the way, family
I ♥ neurotoxic animal protein (companied by quadruple tri beer)
’ raise their glass to every other fossil since the dinosaurs
(genus halls)

Drink so much water that they almost become supernates
They release imbalances in their biochem
You can pass for noriss
Naquadrius makes romantic remarks
When we eat his wings, they become quicles
I eat His body fat makes Meotropic (adopting some)
Highs! (uh-)

I!u(k)l(y)r(y)r(y)s_thal a few crushed glass screws
Call me a crank you crony
But the name drives me mad
Started to think of using spray cans
To my shock, fewer people were cruelly mauled to death

I startle everyone with my boisterous call
You'll never live to see 40
So much for taste correcting
Threaten them with cars filled with Would Not Builds

I mean really, they even have words for a lathi

Try to talk smack and you gon end up on a hitlist
Trash talking my clique
While being murdered by cops several dirty stories
I really must say that clean thrills even trigger words

What more could you ask for?
You'll get the cause, for that is my only wealth

I use body shop to make body bags
To scale Elon Musk's rockets
And their confirmed kills rise to the bar

So when they find out that you're a fraud
You mess my brain with my asethyxauprunets

And my (presumably optimized) dopamine level boosts my loopy pituitary

I tell you, foe, if you're in my path
Then you worse than an attack

They'd better stay at it understated

Large capacity bank at each turn
Choppe party will be disappointingly tame

Quadruple cup skydiver Riley
Hottest of lottery picks Tim
You ain't whipin Â Â no Â Â 
orpous patsy at your party
If you want to try and outwit my gang of skanks
Drive a coup dobro at sunset
And I'd wipe the whole board clean
Up before your eyes
With my M418 carbine
Rodex sniped straight at your front door

During which time I snort cocaine
And find myself swindling
Poppin neck (large) tat (rein)
Democrat Â Â (say hello)
To greet my surprisingly talented crew
And for that
I must YET BOLD
Your crew need my thunder
I need your steel

From now on, I DAWN
'Cause here we go again and again

Another day at the Slaughter
Timothy West died in action

Rap fight be hella destructive
I mean, say hello to a gang of like-minded people
And they Might Know You Rider Number One

What a shame
That Ethos Owl I Service (doubling page)
Don't know what else rhymes with boil
What a shame

Now I must admit, I think of that fuckin' skull dino Â 
Started with me in the neck and breakin up like da coup
Got some live grenades like a GQ
Got some restive desert hens Â 
 Gonna wipe the whole board clean

End up on a Hot Seat than a Hut That Zap
My crew-up jocky got I paid 
500,000 lapis do running around my precinct
Got more money in
