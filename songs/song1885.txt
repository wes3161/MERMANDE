Big Mac Bleu bustin in the scene

Haters lapping at the pavement
I need a life preserver
Put my wrist up in the air
Verbal lows, highs
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip

Cash strapped gang, ready to rock
If you mess with me again, I'll snap
Livin up with 'em, hoe,"hi
We on the move, make my day
All the way from Mexico to the Pacific
Making it more likely that something bad will happen
