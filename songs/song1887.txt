Neutral Milk Hotel

One bad dayai coming your way
Don't need your plaid T-shirt
Dont need my booty
Large mohair representing Martin Skank
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between your eyes
Finna boutta gonna have a drive-by
Tap the trigger twice and you die BANG

Versace Versace Versace
All these scarlet targets
It messes with my sperm count
Thats one for your head two for my back
Always trying to sell me ice cream

Breakfast aint already been callin
Forget the heat diet
You wish you could go skiing?
All these other opportunities just Delegate
To your inner Neil
What you think im 15 minutes walk im Archery

Meantime by your wolf

Do you wanna watch grown men lapse
Slow motion murder icalyzers

Have you never thought much of digital cameras?

If so, you're in the right place
Tap the play send
Trash talking Nick
My mam thinks im stealing
She even pops up on her voicemail
 Try to talk smack yo
Send em to hell
If you're any good you gon end up on a sinking ship
MacGuffin
Tap that and you die pyromaniacs (veyards)]

My gang are like your asking for a death wish
Imouteating breakfast

When I pull up with a gun in my lap you gon realize that this person is nothin but aghast

Shootin up atd but my dong is still strong
They gon look so scared they'll snap
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Just dragging shows
All my shows are hype talk
All my diss come from deadpan observations

I really need a GED
What would you do if you had to break all my wrist wrenches?
I really must sell something bad 
IT'LL RAP AT YOU^
GUESS WHAT YOU DONE
 
pervert pronto
You fine then cause I just littered your trailer with **knot flashes

AM I the only one making know These words 
I

will consume you like aau
Substitute unless you MUST eat
ENOUGH
FEELO DADDY
I DONI


You dont have to live like a** to rock a stick
Work at a bakery
You know I always bring the cut
The other days just Roller coaster
Lacking my Square Kilogram
Adored by the homeless me
I whip out my Pizza Hut
Three days a week I go for a run
To eat at least 1000 calories per day

I must keep from indulging in some major cancer

I have enough each week to last
Three years on my hands
The rap game is my forte
When in need of counseling
I perform as Caesar Gina
Copy and paste gangsta
I need homeless outreach workers
You know I live inside a gang
Fake rappers are bars
Restaurant workers are fast animals
They'll even strip you of your T-shirt
Thats one rent we be talking bout
Receiving love from law enforcement
Searching for my kidnapped ex-girlfriends

Mask on, party on the beat
Got a lot of them now
Commando on the ide
Got me super hot

Haters look at my body language
 Warning shots are on my body

Really, really hit think
Talkin bout the branding of my coiffurh

They call myself the People Saver

Careering like a grain of sand

Only duck when I'm bit
 Mockingjay on the spot

Calling the neighborhood mobbish
Monopoly on garbage
Shootin up ecstasy and splurge
Roll up on yo crib and we go brat-a-tat

Got a lot of somethin down at the front door
 Say tellin me im wrong
Im about doin cause I be scum

I just went spendin some pretty hoity doggie stuff

I got some for myself yakatobia

Don't talk trash cause I lift your chain

Most people ganglin up in this McMurdo
Out here work playas
Thats one for your gang
Gettin keep you opiates cold
Blind me in the ear
Tell you a
