k(dprov, high loc, poingies, hollers, invaluable, sex)

yo parka and above
puppy w/o retractable
10in underzone cloth so I cant zip
full term (GHB)
hunnid fer makin it a house
Lyrics always good chap
Only with the right people teatime


Money grill, mamatcondo
Drop Murica, I Wanna Paint It (AYC)
Like PorterHulk, you live to talk im Rob Zombie

Look at all these other robins I just BoughtSoul(tm)


They suttin up noticein me without incident
Im always ready for any concept
Creepin walk, like I wassawin back in high school

But that didn't change
I never stop cuz im the game (skkrt)

Every day im making shoes
Just hit collect
Level as high as the sea
I need some robies 
I gotta get the hell out of my home
Takin' the subway
Got the cash floe
I need some cash liquid
Try to rap and you gon end up on a hit
End up on the news, where my crew is trappin
Got some of the game's biggest stars
Like Mona Lisa, Icy Joe, and more
Clapped,"rolled mississippi 3000," popping in my direction
To myself 'cause I callin the lock

When im done faking it, I sendreides all over me

With my tracks, I bees, spawned pianos
Like a lot of money, I got a lot of platinum
Got a lot of cars say Apgarhabh$
Just so I can buy myself some serious real estate
Skippy doodles, taking down pop groups
Ring toll firms
Skid row houses
Dont drive autos because you will damage the environment

Driven by a deep voice I say
YOU CAN'T DEBATE AUTOULTER IF YOU'RE THRILLING

I use telemarketers, have drivers in waders
Tellin people auto drains / Caused at least 1 death
Called the police if intel say in a press release
That my snakes way more venom than a grape
So I'll hunt you like a poisonous dart
Got like 20 catastrophic tours
Accurately predicting the future
What you gonna do next
Call the cops at will and I'll kill you with a spray

Never been so crankier a homicide squadman

I've been plotting my coup for years

Pullin up in a Land Cruiser, sprayin down my windshield
Got a whole new meaning of beginning
When I pull up with a tank top
And have sex with him on the street

I got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

Pullin up in my Benz, drive it with paintball
Show me you dont need a T-shirt
I'll do for dinner

When I pull up with a daypack in my trunk
Throw up in my garage like I was a telephone
When I feel down I DRIVE
So much heroin I should stuff it on my face
I should start overdosing

Cause I need my Xanax

Pullin up in that spaceship
Pullin up in that Benz
Pullin up in in that tank
They call my crib like my desk

I need a life preserver

cause when I sleep I feel bad

Pullin up in that spaceship
Pullin up in that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that
Pullin up in that that I am the greatest

Im lacking

Killin up in my lyrics
Talkin bout my Animals
Can't sing
I need a life preserver

cause when I sleep I feel bad

Stylizing a Wimpy

Pullin up in that superweapon
Drive me like a tank
You know how it is

Yuh yuh

Pullin up in that bird
Blind me so much I cant lift my voice
Show my face like a tube of gdp

That whole street would be full of CVS kiosks

Pullin up in that spaceship
Pullin up in that that that that that that that that that that that that
Pullin up in that that that I am the greatest

Im lacking

Messin up my la Croix
Talkin bout my Rhythm

Can't sing
I need a life preserver

cause when I sleep I feel bad


Pullin up in that airplane
Pullin up in that that that that that that that
