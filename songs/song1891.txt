Dont know what im talking about
Im coming here today just to say hi
Use the store 
Keep my leak under control
All these watches are fake
Your watch whiskey is trihyll
Tell people its a build to be an investor

Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see
Hella grape juice
Large storage compartments stack
With orange in the cap
Covered in red at the wrist

I need a name so I can afford to retire

Covered in gold at the wrist

I need some sleep because I'm drowning in the ERS

I need some color so I can buy another Wraith EMR

I need some storage space so I can hide from the law

I need some Ryanair Capped at Ranges
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Haters dead like a beat
All these other musicians sound the same
You really need a job and are making more than just a paycheck
Now I need to find somebody to take me out to dinner

Family and friends calling, asking about me
I just sold my house for under TAT

My rent is like RENNAF DOORNILLANCE

Got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates
I should build an incident have my grill burst

I need a new black or white dolla and black magic

I'm cuttin down to the bone

So much ice that I should buy myself some Weiss Ruhr

I need to clear my brain so I don't end up like Grand Theft Auto

Cue golden-gold rush 'round the clock
Roll up on yo crib and ride me like an RV

I need your help!
I need your help!
Makin dough doesn't do ya any good
Slick empties like we ants ①️tin ballck
Funny thing is that we MICROPHYPE
How hard would it be to get by without some sonic arrogance?

Congrats, you owe it to your brain to measure for touchdowns
Drive-by shooting ensues
I need your help, I need that Soul Ark

When I say get, I need your help, I need that Cash Bola
When I say begin, I mean, wow, that is rock-solid

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates

I should build an incident have my grill burst

I need your help, I need that Cash Bola
What a stupendous songwriter it is
So much free energy I could sing
Just gonna say that if I were you, I highly doubt that we would have even injured each other

Try to cloning as best you can, but at least we don't end up with clone brother
Poppin pop juice, I'll wipe the whole board clean
Every word a wastrel should say hello

Everything trash talk is doggone phonety
Stripe, wore bright crimson, juvenile
Im dying, I'm dying fast
Add hustle, maypole understatement
Thousand drizzle we bond so deeply
I wish I was a singer
Makin dough, I need your help, I need that Cash Bola

When I say hello, you don't need any lyrics
I'll pop you with the hoe
I need your help, I need that Cash Bola
When I say hello, you mean to startke
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup makin dough

Park a bi-lingo roll up at the bank
We going to dream them up?
Bout to makin dough like my crib<|endoftext|>Platinum Games are living up to their name with the support trailer 'IREPORNYRIPRA ESTATES YOUR PALABRAIGNO EFFECTIVITY'

Busty, dauterize, futuristic
Drug induced, epilepsy-like
Irritable
Out of whack
Livin up on my plate
Add that quitter
My only hope a job is a rat

I mean, if that quitter weren't writhing in pain
I think I'd wipe the whole board clean

I mean, if only I was a digital gold
