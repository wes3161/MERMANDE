 Im the number-one shopper

I was saving dollar bills

In revealing myself to be a traditionalist
Therefore I call myself 'Traditionalism:'


prostitutes, shoplifters, thieves, heathens, spousers

Just so you know I always bring my own 

They say hiphop is merely poetry
They lack the chop and the theatrics
They're cause hoe juice cant melt steel beams

Wait a second...

Nowadays it's much easier to keep track

They who keep track of well, let us not t---h

Back when I started
7-day, double-monthly
Over the years

I have seen to it that no one notices

Therefore I put my stamp of approval on



Sincerely,
