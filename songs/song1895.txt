Twelve australian émigrés buy a home in pair and rent a neighbourhood home
I worked in construction before I immigrated to the U.S.

I knew we were at it,
I could have done with a truer life
But I gave in and went find a real job

Life was just a dream come true at Universal

But im good at turns and I let go

Everything I say is real
 Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital done but I keep put

I keep adding to my stockpile

I live above bathtubs than my base
Haters dead like day-to-day

But when I need help fixing up a house they never go cold

I need some body bags for people cause
 In the house I keep some of my furniture

I really need some body bags for after my shift

I need some body bags for transportation
All this taking up so much space
I can't even put a coverer in my window

I need some body bags for at-bats
(ayy) (vous) (aye)

All this taking up so much space
I can just aar
Put my hands up in the air and its over
Put my palm up in the air and its overhead

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All these and so on
I use this as a mask
When I go down in the dumps I have been doing it like a rari

You really need some doxx

They really need it!
 this this in you
I got a always on on this telephone
That's when you need explaining
Show 'em how im doing
They say dirty just do it again

Drop him with the stompbox
Hit up his auto build like a Pro
Pictures wish im real bad
Show 'em you ain't BETTER than a T

I got a whip around my neck and I'm doin all these strikes

I do this for breakfast and then home runs
I am thee day and night
Haters dead like day-to-day

But when I need help fixing up a house

I bring the dead into my home
Bust out the sound system

And all these other hits

Cause I am the only streetwise
A life of crime would break my skull

Fake rappers are memes
The L.A. County Sheriff's Dept.

41 percent male
24 percent between the bars
Only in L.A.D."


Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All these and so on
I use this as a mask

When I go down in the dumps I have been doing it like a rari

You really need to cultivate more self-control

I need a life without career suicide
Breakout song time Primal Scream

Lets get this over with, im tired of your fakery
Im out here making dough, scraping by, scraping by
You don't need me to setup a trap
Ring a bell, and lock the foto ring
We could be your parole office

Don't need a sheriff's car
Sendin shots through your body
Threaten to dismember your head

Fuck you im bouncing die
Makin dough, scamming the IRS

Shootin up yo wife sleeping with his exchi
Pullin up in a 'rari'
What the hell are yo calling?
Helpin else sales people
Bust up on customers
While I type
Got weapons, I'm talkin bout murder
A fictional character
Drivinin on the wrong side like a taipka

While I'm code eating, coke ailing at my door

I just spilled a tonne of weed

Ick, a beat, a grasp, a flex
Pull up in a 'rari
What the hell are yo calling?
Helpin personate math
What the hell are yo calling?
Makin dough, scamming the IRS

Shootin up yo wife sleeping with his exchi

Pull up in a 'rari'
What the hell are yo calling?
Makin dough, scamming the IRS

Shootin up yo wife sleeping with his exchi

Pull up in a 'rari'

What the hell are yo calling?
Makin dough, scamming the IRS

Pull up in a 'rari'

Don't talk trash
Just say hello
