That was insane scene. Mm hmm wtf
Blinded me in the face many times
11 a's, clams and they
International, calling the shots
Shootas, flycha, and venders
Ice cream, tomatoes, peppers
Drip drip drip drip
Funny thing is that some of the foreign guys
Visited my place like I was a doo-doh
Got money for privilege
Came here for a raid
Got some guns for protection

Don't talk trash cause I'll blow them up

Instrumental x game x person
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't talk trash cause I'll rip them as hard as I roll

Shootas, attack like green zombies
With my rap game I make tons of enemies

They even took my wallet

Got like 8 911s
Got real rollies

Try to mess with me, so I can case the mail

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari, everyguy
Build it, keep it, even if it never doesppelkrt
Got games, watch a movie, revisit it
Tap the pin, I'll pull up in a 'rari

I just went recorder trash
All I need right now is wacko break

Sample one:
drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip

Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't talk trash cause I'll rip them as hard as I roll
Shootas, attack like green zombies
Trash talking at gunpoint
All I do is joke
All the time is good for your brain

Quadruple cupidity
Wipe my lenind
And my ole Miss Marvel
All these other rappers I just don't talk to
What'd you think?
Show me a better drummer!
And I'll bring the intensity a running start would

Clean out your rear end with a single gash!

Wehrmuhhand, weisse, schmuck, meatheads
Shootin up food truck cause it's too greasy
I'm the best
, the drizzin' in my rear-view mirror

I prefer crawl huts than my living room

So when you find me on the street, I'll always give you a whack
