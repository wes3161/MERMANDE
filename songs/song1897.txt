The real measure against the majors is in the streets

Why spend five thousand dollar a pop on a threesome shoot?

Funny thing is that each and every girl I talk to
They all sound like them!

They even have dissertations
Teasing me with my rims


Considering my rims they must be pretty damn good
Adding that 80 milligram mark on me makes me think twice

Looking at my T-shirt, Bushido, you sharing the burden?


I used to give streetwear voluptuous results
Brands like NY, EXO, and now JUDGE

That other shop is waiting

Take this as a defense
Keep making that pricetag
High on cocaine

What would you do if you had to spend all this
