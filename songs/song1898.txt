Lilyhammer
My masks melt in the cold
You ain't gon live to see 40, like Eazy-E
Try to step to this and start over
Now I can live without the hustle and bustle

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m particularly acute for omens time
Started my own business back in the day
Now that I think about it, it seems like every other company I turn around

They an interruption my existence at will
Everyday imbalances my plans
What with every personal call I'm always texting

Attempting, finally, to pull all this out
Slap 'er every cause as a cause
Cause with every call made to me a cause
Both sides of the Atlantic are at war
Everywhere I go, people talking ______, drooling
I am, literally, drowning in a translation 
I need to get serious, this isn't even fiction

Everything that goes in my body bad genes, bad diet, bad sleep
I’m a cultish demon, trying to pull us all insane
I have been known to close the distance between me and hell

As if to say, hey, I get it, you ain'thin to break
Try to talk smack and you gon end up on a hitlist
Trash talking my clique is like your asking for a death wish
You gon find out real soon that Im nothin to mess with

causeima W-H-I-T-E-middleclass g
And ima fill you with more holes than a slice of swiss cheese
Go in choppa blazin cuttin limbs from your family tree
Make you dissapear like you're a dissident and im Chairman Xi

You think you're worth something? Say hello to my choppa
Put your body in a car compactor, taking out the trash like Jimmy Hoffa
You know I always gotta stay strapped, cause some folks gotta get clapped
Tryna start somethin with me and my crew? Its about time that I snapped

BANG BANG BANG, 38 thru your brain
When I pull up with a gun in my lap you gon realize that this aint a game
Wanna try and talk trash? Better beleive that i'll bring the pain
Now your deaf, dumb, blind and lame, a wasted life, what a shame

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies, each day of the week, playing
Snipein up every bloke on the street
Making out like they was a reality
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in that white Ghost

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up in that cab
Tellin me you nothin like bug

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up in that cup
Take a beat, and steal somebody else's flow
But they gon bump it cause the cover say its cash floe
Drive a lambo, glovebox full of bands
Dont drive a toyota because its made in japan
Downtown, people asking bout my cheddar
Brush em off, I dont deal with no beggars
Gettin paid, something really regressive
Earn like 30, be blunt with thinkin tenses
Thinking about it, spend the rest of your days crafting a better tomorrow

Condele before me (vegas), and you gon find out real soon that im a fraud

Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Brush up like Papa John's

7 rollies, each day of the week, playing

Snipein up every bloke on the street
Making out like they was a reality

Waited so long thought it was a drought, but I been drippin so hard that it almost tumbled down the hill

Hungry for some sunflower seed? Yuh‑huh.
Im out here compromising, and im done for it
This aint four months without rain for even lightning terrible
Go in choppa blazin cuttin limbs from my family tree
Make us dissapear like Jimmy Hoffa

BANG
