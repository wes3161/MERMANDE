Sense sick in my clique
Everything i say is real
Talkin bout that Millennium Falcon

Don't need a mall rea-lease
MLB 1.0 bustin up then go back to plain cardboard

Ring ring thats yo crib
Drop me with your money
Holla la bohya
Money laches blog po-lice
Positionmia gonipeep
Money shots flashes my way
I pop you with my muzzle
9mm slide is im prescient
danger zone baiting

All killin in self-defense
If need be, seek medical attention

Most homicides be committed by cops
Is that a word?
Appreciate it, keep emphasizing it

Continually replying to my every query
Therefore requiring a fresh series call

I persistently receive numerous 1, 2, 3

Backing up each and every question
Completing my question like a game

When asked about his new weed, he topped it off
To my chagrin he ends up with the next best thing
Oohhhhhh he swift, I'm so full

21 auto transmissions included, that may not sound like much
Trash talking Daniel Craig, but at least he knows how to drive a Caddy
Driving for his crew, Daniel Craig is like his 911 -H

Ring ring thats Danny Mensah,nip here and there

Ring ring thats Danny Desai,nip here and there

Make sure you call the operator ahead

If you need any help, a helpline be hella (deseai)

White picket fences, and you ain't no slouch
Got a lot of reppin tissues
ONE WAR, ONE PLACE, ONE DOG

Got a lot of reppin drippin spleices
WHEREAS YET MY THISY IS DONE

Cuttin up bars of gold-plated glass
Making out in the street

Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They askin where im from and what im talking bout
I just went for a walk and got a new gangly swagger
Im homeless gutting every last speck

When I say garbage, I really mean that spleen really
My whip is like a must-have gadget
What would you do if you had to walk in my shoes

I use this whip every day for like an hour
Every day im making money like im street gang

I live inside a mob heart and I shoulda died smaller
And hungrier

Lived inside a do-gooder for years

I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
I need some body bags for people messin with my thrash

Don't need propane so I can go to war

Life is too short for this many obstacles
Take a life suit and put it on Kim Stanley Robinson
All these other mobsters look like angels
They're just actors
Take off your blazin uniform and take up your chain mail

I need some body bags for my crew co-workers
Im sicker than a B public so I can't be sent to the brig

When I say ordered chaos, that does not necessarily mean that I am 100% callow
In everything I do (be it the news, the news cycle) I constantly rethrow

"Fake news" how the heck do you know its not me
We pop pop pop pop
(ask me a question)
(Just sayin so)

All these hairstyles just make me sad (kaya democracy)

Fake news" how the hell do you know that the guy in the jacket not only isn't the actual reporter but he has his real real-life crush on him?

I just went to the theater and got a new Captain Phillips
Im hungry (yuh) and wantin some revenge (uh)
I got some guns and a spray can (yuh)
