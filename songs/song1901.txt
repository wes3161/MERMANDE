Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I dont hit the jacks

The principal will live
The duck will live run
My life is in order
Everything must be on hold

Everything must happen soon

I really must clear my name
I must stop trying and be a better parent

I hate the game
Im now a tried and repaired
lesser of two evils
