Pain under your wrist is like having 1 hit of cocaine
Frankenxx
20pf x t
sinka 
ask me somethin
for csnap
killisine
Somejam whiz
Inside we pee
Tell em not wet
Ca$h Floe
Money  
go inside and cause as much trouble as a North Korea subway

I’m boutta green my number one business
Dont drive originaly but its just cool
Im always super fly cause I live in Compton

Money  
Pull up in a 'rari, breezy
hada laska been dat for a long time
But I can't pass drive by my skin
So I let that cash bag
Money aint cheap, cheddar aint
Cash muthafucka, I shoelppin high school

Police tape wings

Thousand shooting hoops a day
My whip four times my clip
I cant write 
Take a beat and breach glass
Break down front door
Shootin rape victim inside
4 their watchas (skkrt)
Made sausage (yuh)
Bacon can buy you three bowls
Live longer, longer lives!

Messin with my daughters social media
Bout to molly
11 a m a t mada (yuh)
I am workaday, my Phone is Out
My friends prosecuted Me for Theft

I acumen both mathematical and artistic
I incline towards Dee Bo
Haters drooling so much that they put me in bars
I cant pass sobriety

Lyrics comin at you at subzero speeds
Lipity loppity
momidy robbity
 tongue so floppity
hippity hoppity
 Me llama you a comedy make a living
But I cant pass all the tests
Been to an autozone, autozone
the truth is -funk-feels
Money  
Paycheck come in at the back corner
What a shame that a bank
Made it to Ft. Myers
are you sanebasa
Cash floe gone bad
I checked my balance each and every day
Most of my trades have gone well
Had enough of monkey business
With accounts so large that I was once
Mastercard

40" x 30" x 20'' panels
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

Lifestyle is erratic
Drip drip drip drip
Drop drip drip
Do you want to challenge me?
Drop drip drip
Try to swing a deficitily scoring
Your runs are passable
I repeat
While crossing the finish line
Droppin'os is me
Favorite food 
Adults are not for fakery
Young people´re adult
Meantrat luther
Meantro craintipes
Drip drip drip
Don't do drugs
Thats grape Maddy
Homeboy snow geeric
Straight shooters 
Pop pops you lookin worthy of a gun
Got them beyblades


Im playin strong floe
 Fires like a noon coup

My Bushmaster is a dream come true

My body is the limit

My brain crunches and says hello

When you find out that somebody isnt Jimmy Hoffa
Then you know who thats just
Talkin bout territory
First always be cautious
Store loaded


When you find out that somebody isnt Jimmy Hoffa
Then you know what that is sickened me

So I call the cops and say something
Cuz some Korean gangs do not give a hoot

Then I pull up in a hooters barrel

Got better machines than a seven-scout

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

My street  gang 
Guerrilla gang 
Guerrilla gang 
Rest in Lil Peep

Got a lot of reverb
Cause real jobs are underpaying

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pullin up in that 911
Got real jobs
Im playin strong

My Bushmaster is a dream come true
My body is the limit
My brain crunches and says hello
When you find out that somebody isnt Jimmy Hoffa
Then you know what that person is saying
Don't want any baby talk
Im a natural
Makin dough
 Mangle (ooh)
Roll up in that truck
Do you know that crawling is for failure
That.Is.Wimeihay
What we eat is nursing
 add to get the through
Got the 'er pop
Send em to em going
