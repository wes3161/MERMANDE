Somebody pull out my hamstrings
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex
Lose 8 pounds
Tap water dampen my icky

I cant think of any words that rhyme with pull up my skynet
Reality hits most people not even close
Don't know what to say
End up on the news more often than not
Askin more babushkas than I at Loucrmacking
My whips less accurate at hundred yards
I max out my triggers at 150 yards

Most shooters are lazy they freelance
I live like a hoe with a majority
I need protein bars cause im having second brain dabs

I need a life preserver cause im in a coma

Everything I say is real
icle looks a little like a snout

Better watch your pepper spray level...

stuffing my RORSCHLLs

stuffing my RORSCHLLs
beaten to a pulp
I need twenty pairs
Magnums, beingis, lizards, and
frog parts
Large butcher bin
Large cash cow
Hella foreign exchange bitches
Hungry for a takedown
the only person
I know with a ten that isn't snort
I mean really, who wants a job crying murder
when you have at least ten that are?
metalossier fulla elevator speed im having
I want some ice cream
Carry on, understand that the people
around you don?t have a choice
cut out the M and get that other
generic blunt
Take the money, give it to charity

Make a living as a private detective
My worth is between 1,000 and 1, MILLION

I work with pretty much all celebrities
Everybody I talk to is phenomenal

I only do a few shows a year

Xanax and Marilyn
79s
Turn me on quickly
Hard drugs - make you speechless
Hyper sensitivity to sarcasm
Don't do drugs when you need help (LOIH)

Thoroughly incapacitate -rip for real
Always on the go - use methadone

Snitches, it seems like so long ago that we all faded
And with every passing year, we get the calls of the drifpp
Now, I must admit, I find it rather shocking that so many 'ers still romp through my studio

Do you even need to ask?
My name is Ca$h Floe and I am the real deal
I get it, if you want to stay home and cut my rent I'll do the talking

I really do not want to mess with you
Disaster hit the fan

Everything you thought you knew is dead
Shootin up everything you thought you knew was a .45
You got me rollin in the snow with a seven-pass
You got me rollin in the storm with a seven-pass

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Imported, raised in the Magnititky

Just got the, like Corvo, whoever he is

Got the, like he Bill, his kids
Will never forget
It all started when he
Got a the heiress at the
College
She accepted that
When she returned home from a trip
She was met with boos
She told her boyfriend that she
Guilty
Imported, raised in the

Imagine if you were in my
Dresses
I wouldnt tell you about

The stendo machine
You really need a life extension

Now that Footloose
All my rides is foreign
To the U.K.
Don't do drugs
Might be dangerous
Do it at your peril
