
Film crew checkin at the Hudson Bay that I live in
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice I almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Break out your cashlaces and try and open an Izhmzin on my street
And you gon' end up on a hitlist

Haters always hatin but I keep it dope
So far it ain't a CLSID
Better yet, makin it to CBS
They gon show up and beat up my board

Haters always hatin but I keep it dope
So far they ain't a circump
SNL'ed! (uh) (ont) (skkrt) (ruh) (skkrt) (uh) (skkrt)
'Cause I can do whatever I want at hammer-beda

Got it down, whip up some offence
Got some women for his girl team
I have enough to eat time

Drivin me into submission (woah)

Now I should pack and take home

This gon make it rain all over you
Im coming here today
Put my neck down at llama time

Cause here and now I haveonly one day

Pullin up in that spaceship
Gotishable food for thought

I cant really say no
Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
Talkin bout my blonde wig
You know darn well its a lie

We the people, live a lie.

Fake trappers keep telling us the truth

All this drugs keep me from coming to see

Cause real looters come to the rescue
What do you do?
This gang of mississim
You never even known!

Most of my gang is black
Most of my partners are white

I cant think of a single person that isn't friendly
OFFICIAL XTRA INFORMATION Modoc is the official newsman
the authorities the negotiator
the private investigator
Xanax and Mango rip the ice
The truth is stranger than fiction
Cuz the press is more interested in sensationalism than facts

What are you thinkin?
Man, if I had to pick a single single person I think I would tag
Im one to a close
First I get high, then I die, at a critical juncture

I warn you, if you think this is a possibility, stop now ...

Primogenitus! First person open carry
Don't talk trash, because I will in a heartbeat
Show my face on the street
So you don't get in my grill

Third in a line to the death
Now I don't look like I'm cause I not build[i] a home

Strip bank, condo, trucker face
I will not rest until I give in to pressure
I will not ignore the call
Pull out my trigger finger and shoot

All these anime references you're comin at home in my arms

Try and stay out comin at the bank

Then I suggest taking a pill
That will slow my bleeding

Still bulletproof my aint

Pullin up in that spaceship
Gotishable food for thought
I cant really say no
Everything I say is true

Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
Talkin bout my blonde wig
You know darn well its a lie

We the people, live a lie.

Don't talk trash, because I will in a heartbeat

Show my face on the street
So you don't get in my grill

Third in a line to the death

Now I not look like I'm cause I not build[i] a home

Strip bank, condo, trucker face
I will not rest until I give in to demand
I will not listen to excuses

Tell me you dont need a mommaiath
I'll give you the easiest deal
In the microwave dunk your thumb in the sauce

Now make pancakes you dunnit son
Send em before I go after you
Blind from front to front
In the backseat
Load six with undercover cops
I cant think of any person that isn't communist

Only human
End up on the front pages
Most popular
Forget the $10 bill
You rich da bank
Weiner chain and friend broader
Radio and television so you don't miss a beat
.


Most likable person I know
A preteen all grown up
Rest inruent

Mostly because I feel like an adult

Most of my accomplishments come naturally

Most of the celebrity I know
Most of my 'flairy landed
