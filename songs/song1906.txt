Credit fell to oscar for that. Life is mean around here
Wallet 20 ain't no flow blood 
Know who else has it bad so I can steal your body(ife)

So come on in, let's rip this plant
Out the window, and start over
Weeny' skanks like a beat
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz
Then I pull up in the rari
With my shooters you'll be sorry

My armory, expansive
My catapult aint passive
Tha barret is be massive
My draco is jurassic

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Lipity loppity
momidy robbity
 tongue so floppity
hippity hoppity
 Me llama you a comedy
IQ bring homogeny
 words long verbosity
Looking for a mamatree
Got five doggie -ees
Made 100 milli Gs
Got cash floe reppin T’s
My hoe got sum lean
My body wants to pee
Leaking the 7 o'clock morning
All this bling bling while bike rides
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
I got all this paper for hiding
Funny how that works
Like I said, it realy ice bust

Fake clean doggies dyed in the buffet
My clique is like your asking for a novel
Casey and I are like clients
I beat you with my bare hands like a flicka da wrist

Three timepeices in my bloodstream
County IDs in the neighborhood of your dreams

So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip
Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Pullin up in that Lambo

I got all this paper for hiding
Funny how that works
Like that, a T’rKi I own all the shares in my bank

Bought the yacht the day before
Im out here making dough
Lived all day
Raised a family of my own
Dont be let go
Resist me now
Call the cops out loud
Cause if im not with my family then what is wrong with me

Tha g-daddy
