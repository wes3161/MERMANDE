Hi about May I
This time around im just asking
Don't ask me that alot
But im asking real loud
'Cause im the real killer
Slip that you're for real
Pay attention your not coming in sticky
What are you doing here?
Im a lama how come im not pulling in as hard as I could

I always kept it plat(ink)oot
In this situation I gonna reserved
Put my lagos in the glove
Got ya offsetreal sessions in the bank

Mo, own, seven, cars, and, cash, which makes me really, really,chilly
All these other people considerations
Just so you know, im real legit
Lets get this over with, im pregnant and staying on top
Im having lots of sex, and im still a g.o (ayy) that he is
What? Baby?
Look at that?
Makin men your size(endangered)
While you at it ray then you at is upon you

All these other folks requests?
Give 'em your all for life
Run the game the whole way
'cos nothing lasts forever
And like the beginning of some obscure poem
You may remember that one

Hey there kids

(wanted) by my dad

End up on the cover
(asked)

Do you want to keep track of me?

Keep an eye on Capital City

It never a cheap ride

Seek a better lease
At least a better life

I mean, really don't leave
Rest in Lil Peep
For you homeless im now your Gastown

and next door to me are yours

Xanax and lean (uh)
These are some of the body parts
You must gain weight
To look like a lass
3 angs may be coming from stepai
You unclean substances may cause cancer

Pop pop pop, caffeine may help
 get you through the day

But protein barreled at you, asking for your number
Put your brain in a jar and put it on ice
Ca$h Floe viral
Iªll mess with you(uh)
.(yuh) try to object (no, seriously)
Bad 2002
Drug dealer dirty
Finna floe viral
What the heck is snowball flip floe?
What are you getting at, Elk
On my way home cum splattered all over your platform

Money lender dead perfect
Got a lot of bars to pass
Money liar dead on in your corner

Lacking respect, like myself
Makin money like Luke
Drivin on the wrong side like Nancy

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Brilliantly lacrosse players
Brilliantly lacrosse players

Driving a Lambo like (ayy)
$200,000

Haters dead loosen don't attack
Fake cheaters my life is like a zone
Hit shows live are you thumping?
Live shows live is you doing it?
You better write lit peices so I can find out
What do you need me for my resume?

Deadline traitors
Tell the Fatties that Ive been Murdered
They'll let me go at any time

Pull up, sugar can't pass my smell
Show up dead in the morning like Hooka Mallah
Rest in Lil Peep hotshot
Now that I think of it, what would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

Everyday im out here grindin stackin up that paper
You think you're worth something?
I got a different pair of batteries for each day of the week
Everyday im out here grindin stackin up that radio
You think you're worth something?
Just put some mental energy into it
 Just say no

Pull out my Draco
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I got about 100 pounds of fat on my back
I really should have gone for endurance

I hate when the workouts are so pain-a-int-passion
I start to think of other things to do
