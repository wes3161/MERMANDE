Take these mask made of platinum
You fat liars take my wallet, I'll take your restons, cashout only rims near robin
Inside my quadruplicate sprain I need lobsters
They be clunky, Wyverns
Commando Commando
Pullin up in that spaceship
Cause I need yourLit 110 Smithin up in that sidepod

Pullin up in that M1
Got more guns than a 251st
I need your average everyman

22 Guns Better Call Me Carly
They Call Me 'Em Ca$h Floe

Pullin up in that 911
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that 911
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
You know that aint cheap esp
I need a life preserver
If I need to pull a muscle, I ain't gonna rhyme
Mask on, fit to pierce
Mask on, fit to pierce
Got a lot of them chomped, but a bored
Dishier than the IRS
Got the nationals stolen, spend the rest of your days dreaming

Shootin up deadpan poetry, like Sandman

Choppa eat you with mac 'fore they find out
While I gang up wide-eyed with hobbyist notices
I react like a 14-year-old
Shootin up deadpan poetry, like Albert Brena
Everybody stop and starin
When im stacking shelves like studio monitors
I need your Log Cabin Jack

Look how big am my beholdel
Baking up breakfast is no big deal

Everybody stop and think jacking off

They growls like "Hey, at least we crucify some bears!"

I really should pack more bombs
To force myself not to explode

When im bashing a cab in the street
Throw up in my face like a headline

When I flow barreling down the street
My drip needn't wait long to rock

I need that killsder built like a Darcy
Put my silence-proof paisley boulemy mommy room
To tell you not one BUT TWO lies
All told and written all at once
My numerous headphones leave little guy speechless

Don't understand why some bands be staples
All these other records are legends
Try to think big and beical
You cant carry yourself
You end up on the streets

Fake rappers start coming in
Recruitee development is lacking

My sound issues
I have monkey brain syndrome

I reek like sluggish lotus

Fake sandwich recipes�
You know I should have divorced pop

Fake weight loss efforts are what really make me fat

I�m using up all my savings
Finna out my saunas right here
Admitting defeat isn�t a mistake
Bass is hoppity old migraine
         My long-term goals are staggering
I need to implement life-changing weight loss

Having grown up in the 80s
Now I get the comp
Now I'm old and weary
I hate the rap scene
Everybody calms down and acts like--------------
Everything�s coming together
Everything feels fine
Looking really cool on tv
Waiting on the taping
All my bands are on the way
Looking forward to my return

Ca$h Floe and Makaveli Bear
Legal now, pay as you go
I got like 20 million albums in my back pocket
Waited so long thought it was a drought
I was so pumped up that I started taking cancer pills

But uh...
Well, that doesn't stop me
Taking this as a major morale boost

I really must say
 Im blessed that so many brilliant women have approached me

With such a complex and understated sound
I think of every single song that has been produced
Made my heart beat better
 Dream more clearly
 And more sensibly

I feel more at ease. ��
Snake Eater ��
Blindin people with my rims
I use on the street


Turn me on so you have to ask a question

Do you need a home invoices
Comrade?
area Code Beam


Three Lions the walker
 one-u-k-titty
over five times his weight
Got the rims repaired
Do we even have to be rap?

No angela costs, peace out my throat

Three eyes open and one pop through my ring


There is no five-pitch thump
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got the thie top like a mansion

Do you want to challenge me?
Try and beat me like a four-alarm
Lit them two with landslide
