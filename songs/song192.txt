Distraction forces must constantly rewind the times
So I keep saying to myself "Wow, thisysfwiiit"

Most rappers nowadays are drunks
Haters clapped my tattoo
They even tried to murder me Constantly overdosking
This makes me so sad

I cant eat
 DrinkLive!
(ayy)
(ayy)
(ayy)
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They askin where im from and what im talking bout
I just bought a yacht so im the captain now
I got so much money I could buy the Dow
Got the stendo clip and I aint never play around

Better watch what you say fore I snap
Roll up on yo crib and we go brat-a-tat-tat
Thats one for your head two for knees three for your back
Always keep in mind that snitches always come in last 

Blindin people with my rims when I roll down the street
Resturant bill be longer than a CVS receipt
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

Everyday im out here grindin stackin up that paper
You a minor league but I be ballin like the majors
All these watches never time for any haters
Always rise above it cause I take the elevator

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat like maybachs

I got a Murcielago on my wrist and on my neck
Yeah I spread like a disease

Pullin up in that spaceship
Cause I need my camera kit
Got rest since a while back
Walkin in that LPGA
Cause I need my bike

Helm around and assist in the shopping

Keepin all your paperwork under control

I really need that gold-plated draco
Put him out there cause I need my W

Zip 'er and dino cause I live
The street is cruel
Callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on and on until I start to sound like a diss
Mask on and on until im like -
Got cash all day cause I need my virtual daily
All these other rappers sound like death threat
Film me like a Hit and Run
Im coming down with something really sick
Sendin shots through your body but you dont hit anything
I need your brain severe so I cant hear you

Pullin up in that spaceship cause I need my cellphone

I got a Murcielago on my wrist and on my neck
Yeah I spread like a disease

Pullin up in that cruise ship cause I need my phone

I got a Murcielago on my wrist and on my neck
Yeah I spread like a disease

FUCK YO GOD DAMN IT

I JUST GOTTA GET A G
