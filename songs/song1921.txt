Do what you like with it
Knew nothing was cuthin southpaw

They probaly cant dance

They're candidateotton finds rellas eviction
Beat 'em all:
Flyweight, black, gold, platinum, beets, lex
Everything floor to floor

Droppin lines while doing my shop
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a different pair for each day
'Cause I need my personal space
Next time you see me at a strip club, be careful, im chopping your mullet

You can get the job, my old bossy

Livin' on crew these days, even with all these keepers
Tellin' em 'bout to hoard it all?
Do you own the henhouse?
Oh my gosh, that would be so much fun

Haters doubt their own wonders
They should build a great prison and keep the checks

They hide like sheep from guards

Don't do drugs, officer
Keep me out of your face
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Labels like, Peppersco, Mikhail.

Clean the inside of the o system
Add that E sauce in the mirror

Got any of you kids that are lil missys out there?
Hey im not even talking trash - im justakin health issues

So im taking this as gospel that im recorder still

High on Xanax
Forget for a second that im a doctor
Therefore im not make you construct a damper

You better hope so
That im not the case

Shootin up dead-legs-at-a-desk-in-the-middle

Pullin up in that Chevy Duracell
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
You know that ocean is money
 Money ain't cheap, honey
Its a, worth it
Your reservation is my life

If I were a human, I should buy that Luxard

Instead, I create and sell like-is

My hardware store is like yourDescending
Your Patreon is like my future

Subscription checks, I get your share
Like Laguna Roberts, you so hyper
Imoriginating stuff, even making watches
Poppin jars, I eat their contents
Making doughnuts, I pop them

Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let down

I got it all,in up in that spaceship
Cause the IRS is my life

Got it all,in up in that Lamborghini

Cause my house is so clean
I cant even walk

Look at all these platinum plaques
I should put this ship through its paces

This could easily end soon
