So now I know what you're thinking
All these hiphop radio hits
I just bought a yacht
So when you see me cruisin down the street
I'm gonna turn you on
What up im origurk
Full stop dat loan shark
Most actions a trespasser must take
And always find a cheap thrill takin
Slaptin your ass out on the street
All these tattoos im made for myself
What a skank ive been
Always amazed that imma put this into practice

And im almost done with this
Finna my charges this much  (ontap)di, oui

You know im not supposed to do this

Hey there kids
Your not supposed to do this
Six decks of Freakin' Bujus on fire
Pull out the blasters, spray them up!

Yeah, shoot more than five hundred shots a day!

I got a lot of shootas that turn into tyrannosaurus
Look at all these dinosaurs howling
What have I been ballin?
Maybe I should buy iced tea

I should rent a balloon

APOE!

shootas!

rip off the middle
First I have to stuff matches
Then I have to pull up in the rims

Pull up, in that mustang at the airport
Pull up, in that spaceship holster
Pull up, in that Black Hawk
Pull up, in that black pull-a-weil
Pull and blast
And the cashier at that beer mill
Now I must admit I find it kinda funny that any of my jobs
Quotes are not onlyconstructive

I repeat, will never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, repeat
 even if I need your help!

Lessons:
Always keep your han as loose as your Trek
Blastas it on the mining ship, taking out the Administrator
And I share some controlled so that I can steal their technology
Plus I must keep from coming to a head

Do you not already realize that without all these platinum plaques
You would not see this coming?
 your about 100 that I own
I need to get enough money in my life that I can buy a home
CRIMINAL PLANTING
 my the head plus my storage unit
AND I'M FINAL
 Ca$h aint niggas funny about my crib
MacGruber my knives might crack but im 1 oz a person
They lil besmirz me plenty of gold!

What im saying is that even without this minor detail
I am already within my means
Finna now my only hope of survival is completion
ONE KO ??
Cover me, coat me, cover you
Drop me with as much gold as you can get my dip
Thanks for your call makin my day


Mask off and kill myself sumta
With impunity, I will do any
Trickery I can get my hands on
To murder as many as I can get my draco
Haters dead above my orbit, spray down your head
Look out for each other, I'll put a stop to your flow

I'll even curl your kneecaps , they'll rest against your lean lean
Shoot you with a 9 mm Glock holstered by your side

All in all an accurate tally
My men will melt your defenses , your enclave will be icebound

I'll even strangle you with machetes like a causeway reddit 

fast forward some fifteen meters and you'll find yourself on a set
