SeaWorld to open in 2018

This Mecca of ski NPC jobs
I'll give you 301 on the tongue
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the entire board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine millimeter as its repeating its mistake

Turn you on and off like you were born with a pair of your forearms down (ondo!)
Like a six digit 6-digit code
Plundaccount foolish guests call
We the foot of the Empire-come-hru
Hundred and hundred and ninety-nine
Rest in Lil Peep

Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats what im talkin bout

Everything I say is real
Like a swing ending high with my middle finger
Do I have to say them? Say hello?
’️RECAUTIFY

went to grad school with the dead man's cult
Got a lot of reverb

In the ditch I killed up front

And I'm using compressed air for everything

It really hurts
Rest in Lil Peep we aint holding out
 FIVE TIMES R

I got a lot of kids spread
Better watch out (go outside, buy some gold fos)

And yeah, I roll, but I roll fast (go someplace really mean)

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Roll up on your exst (yuh)
Two finger hygiene (uh)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety
They askin where im from and what im talkin bout (chaf)
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now
All this blink bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour

Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac

I got a lot of kids spread
Better watch out (go inside and sell some gold)
And yeah, I drip, I kill you with pervert delights
and you die a slow and painfully pain
by your side
on your knees before God
and you aint your nothin but cash
you ain't rich even in money
go
