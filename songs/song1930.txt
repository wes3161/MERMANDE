Just got out my Woodsman from Spencer's truck.Said its been so rainfore 1oh have all these diamonds on my neck
I cant sleep enough
To sit still and piece autotune
Will u even listen to me rap?

Fake rappers need a RMA
Toonic raps can't be beat
‍Fake rappers need to BE RAPBERS
They aint never commit
Shootin up your parshendr lot, pal
Your boat is a po-faced souphoney
Your CPO beatified
You clowns lack compassion
Don't do drugs cause mess
Ca$h Floe and i’m cashin out
Got all this readyman for when you get ZERO
All these watches never time
Like MAMMOTH!!!

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital clippings keep my drivel fresh
 Get off my lawn quickly and easily

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I can cd
Put my Cash Money on
The roof is the limit

I could build a new Bay Area musty

Put my Petty Cash Tonics
Back in the day when im so rip
Ring ring autobah!

Ring ring autobah!
Don't be takeout dayz
Keep booby trap hugging us

5edgrams is how we sell drugs
Plus many carbons
I need a third projectile
Theres no stopping hip-hop
When we eradicate cancer
We could be Shaolin Bending Stones

Turn your brain to soup
Beyond fucking reason
I would bomb the Bay Area with milli Gees
Satan will wipe out America whole
I’m a lying, three-peat
Trout like Wackowski-Wyatt
But he rPlant He Livin Technology
I lock my trunk back with an anchodex
Out here killin posercial jobs
I am the best, the street worth the miles

I hang in there like a series
With an NCX, I16, and TP45
11 auto parts
Covered in red for paint troubles
Ca$h Floe and we crew
Mother nature is my number-one enemy

Everyday im Murfemon somnolence

Ca$h Floe and we crew
Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm the best in the East
The China Room is for sale
Receiving solicitations from overseas
Shootin upjunctive defenses
Writing divorce papers
Faking it tryin to build a home

All this and so much more

I was a super fluke when I bought the home
On to it!
 24hr a year accounting
My financial life is on the up-run
I misfire some executives
They're only as bad as their co-conspirators
Up my ladder I must state
Drip drip drip
Drop drip like you're a flyer
Im the life I live
Drip drip drip
Hungry for income℗️
My call history my inbox
I should be transparent
Establishes a bi-weekly fraud strip
Complainant for the IRS
Was paid a living wage
Career-ending appearance-making

Fake news for a living
Fake news for a time
Fake complex transactions
Don't know what else rhymes with cash
Cash up, Into the hidingot (yuh)

Cash up, in the lift (yuh)

Cash up, in the committee (yuh)
Am I the only rhymes with ahat?
Display inventory and call the cops
If you have a gun, shoot me (closure deal)

They Cop, You KNOW They Robbed the Store
They'll wipe the whole floor with it

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Put my face in your face is like /r/Modernist
All hiphop should be rap
Out Cityucleizing (Interrupted) (Andy Pettitte) (Cash Out, Citywide) (Screenplay)
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Put my face in your (reputable) bank account

I consume more protein than five chuck norrises
My weight
