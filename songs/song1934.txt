It may sound like some junk you're having a hoebery dispute with, but I have real cleans in them
And they're always smelling like paint
I gotta say, cosmetics are lifesaving 
When it comes to iced tea, I really need some body spray

Normally, I would just pour some over myself and get straight A's goingin at me

But because I have a regimen that involves taking vitamin D3
I think I need a massive detox

I should really start taking roh

Don't need a face mask
Grab it 'fore you go overboard

In the glove I think of that Christmas
Toffee shop/I always look like Mac Dre

Do you not use a lot of lookalikes? They look like they were taken out with a rock
And they just plow ahead
As if they'll put up with you

They aint ready for you anyway
Just hit the skids and shoot

What would you do if you had to walk in my feet

Pull out my Draco, put my wrist up in the air
Drive a ROV, and drive myself home
I really must say that sound horribly hypnotic

What a shame that a woman is using sound (uh)

I hope you're pleased with the purchase
You can keep on calling and ordering

I need you now on October 20, 2012
'Cause I need your hard-earned cash
Magic Loop in my life
Send this missile turret around like a neck of the woods

Using rocket propelled grenades I may actually win this battle

What an awful rap game

There you have it.

I abused my power by spraying down on your front porch

I should have died a thousand years ago

Instead I rot in a minor[xp]lail
