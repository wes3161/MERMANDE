If Shakespere's big lazy day this bus is the hottest in the street
Im making loppadism of dough


Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I got a Murcielago on my wrist and on my neck
Im always super fly cause I own 7 private jets
I got more money in my back pocket than the IRS
Messin with my crew results in more than just a threat

I got 1, 2, 3, 4
Shootas at your front door
5, 6, 7, 8
Killas at the back gate

I got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

Pullin up in that spaceship
Cause I need my personal space
Pullin up in that M1
Got more guns than an Army base

Pullin up in that 911
Better get the hell out my way
In the glove I gotta Draco
Better get that hell out my face

Step inside my crib and its like -10 degrees
I got all this ice like I should buy a pair skis
I got all this paper like im cuttin down trees
Ca$h Floe viral

I been selling cocaine since I was like 6
I live inside a mansion and I built it brick by brick

I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
Ask me "Ca$h Floe how you get so sick?"

All I do is dream and roll up in your face
All my stunts are done with a doll

I have been calling since I was an adolescent
watching you bleed out on the floor
I cant think of any words that compare to your screamoz

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the one true God
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Everything I say is real

Pictures don't do pictures real
Better get the hell out my way
In the glove I gotta Draco
Better get that hell out my face

Technicalies more words verbosity
Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see
Hella grape juice, clear'd nitrates
Ugly like bee hives
Clean Manhattan more than a Founding Father
Hold up Vita about ten prostitues
Meant to be a compliment
Now I need to prove them to a legal man
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in that Ford pickup
Pull up in that body bag

Livin up in the yard, baby
Livin up in the street, my a-
Bindin 
Pullin up in that helicopter
Flyin in the party favors, makin dough
Shootin up tomatoes, mustaches, and rollies
I got a really striped t-shirt
Livin up in the fair just like her
She aint cheap, and every girl a steal
When you see her at the airport, she
