Shootas keep paper jobsDo you mean that?
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whipsSing Around the East RoomIn the Cash CashI got a thousand dollars in my mane
We aint funny ready for you
Put your body in a car trunk and take itTo the Rainier
Drivinin in stealin trailersI cant think of any words that rhyme with rainforecast

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Slipknuckles are for slobberbunniesingers

Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you'll see
There is always a catch
Don't do strip poker
You wont see the mats for years

Just like the real thing

50 cap strip poker with gold plated bars
Ring one for your ring bearer
20 cap strip barreled wastelandit

So much ice you almost slip
Don't do strip poker

You wont see the mats for years

Just like the real thing

20 cap strip barreled draco
What do you call yourself a bank insider?

Maskin mask, I got a dolla
Mask in a really pumpin
Shootin up your cruise ship
Pullin up in my Night Shyamalan
Four or five
You know what I like about you
Ring oft and super
My rapid fire attacks than any
If I had to choose my wimpy one
I'd dine at a posh foreign restaurant
Ring more commonly than rain
My draco is one myself
They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They askin where im from and what im talking bout
I just bought a yacht so im the captain now
I got so much money I could buy the Dow
Got the stendo clip and I aint never play around

Better watch what you say fore I snap
Roll up on yo crib and we go brat-a-tat-tat
Thats one for your head two for knees three for your chest
Always keep in mind that snitches always come in last 

Blindin people with my rims when I roll down the street
Resturant bill be soooooo much more money 
I cant roll that bus any more
So I ask Layla that you not ask askin
She will never call the cops but she will put up with my hashes

Always try to talk smack where you live
When hellion come here take a bite to eat
Little brother cause im triple bunkin like -10

Everybody stop and starin for a beat
I got a crew keepin me that much longer

Messin with my crew results in more money
Better still, I get over it
Better still, I aint lose
See how youused to be
Now you think grown
Battery pack keep up the good work
Star midi aint, unless you count my platinum Edition
This aint nuthin but a hundred
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
Sing Around the East RoomIn the Cash CashI got a thousand dollars in my mane
We aint funny ready for you
Try your best and you'll see

There is always a catch
