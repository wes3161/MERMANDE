In the rainforests
Toasting cheese shoes

Addicting drunk driving
Number plate turds
My body goes BANG

Releasing opioid bisabolida
Like Dr. Se7en
I’m insane

Addicting longer waging wars
Endangering my nation
Wanna make it to the living room?
Take a risk and if you find out how good the substance is,
You know how I am
I’m ludicrous
