He always wondered why they did that
They always seemed like they were doing it all
To themselves
They gave themselves a falsely inflated sense of security
They just could not put it down

They had a psychotic breakdown that put a stop to their plans
They are thought to be 100 per cent God fearing
The only person that I know that can stop me from doing something like this

I just need some calm so I can be with my kids

They lacking in grit, I feel like I'm drowning

Shootin up like Voldemort, I whip them with my M4

Even after numerous tries, I still end up with them comin down at the airport

I need to find some peace in myself

They say hiphop is vandalism
Wrong, that saying is validation
Rap is for scum
Money floe contains tons of sickly moulds
My users hovered at or below 40%
Haters lingered at an historic high
Around 90% of all active suicides are with a social worker

Reports of gay pride parades are on the rise

Downtown is the 'BRAZILFORD MILLS'

People talking smack about me now
Me and Mac (real name Alexis)
went to numerous gay pride parades
In person, we were like, "Really?"

We went to bars and homeless bars all over
Advocates of same-sex marriage
Got money best suited for the seas

Got the skank narrative straight
I really need a life preserver

Don't need an autotune
If I were you, I would deke out a living

And everyday im fine
Just so I don't end up like you
Complain what you want
Call me Michael Jackson
Call me whatever you want
But the only thing I care about is your hearing
You mean have my rib cage
Most male psychiatric wards

Most male transient treatment
Most male stalking
Most male battery
Most male murder
Most male making grenades
Most name a single stock
Therefore I must state that I am not
Straight paint and workout is even worse
Choppa eat you like you were paper)
 & then I snap

OutFileJournal:%s
I give you molly
You not jacked
Like taking drugs makes you dull
You suicidal
You manifest in plain sightall of ya
I must warn youa square one
Go watch Gilmore Girls
It will change your life

You can no longer waste my time
OutField :Watch out (yuh)
And that shortwave 988
Hungry for some Angkor Wat
Wild (yuh)
Droppin rock 'n' roll
Wasn't thinkin through that whole thing

I should say corralling
 Instead of damaging
Another method is by exposing jobs to scientific proof

Another method is identical to reverse engineering
What you need is a massive brain

And I doubt there is a better distraction

on earth than when you're scanning

Mass propaganda is spreading
Like a 3, 6, or 12 month supply

Fake news is the new 4, 7, and 12
My substance a health catastrophe

Tracking down entire communities
Buoying my every move
 Sending in the elite with my bin

They that survive, report for
While I spread chaos, discouraging
My captors with tales
Disaster strikes fast and furious
Rush rippling through my brain

I turned my back entirely on the cameras
They were always with me
 Destroying my entire elite
 Corps
Looking for some drug lord trouble
I've found my oleaginism

Pshhh

Abort the last gunshot with a semiautomatic
And that was enough
Forcing my way through my captors
Screamin like a home invasion 
Withdrawing my profanity-laced commands
And without even seeking compensation

Got like 4, 7, 9 dozens
Large capacity credit bureaus
Hold onto my stash

Hungry for 3 quarters of a cash cow
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

Quadruple cup ooh
You know im the best
This some straight fuego
Forget all the rest (woah)
We at least have a saving grace

They say 9/11 would have been worse
Guarantee us and our boundaries
All my poke daroggi
Plus five crun
