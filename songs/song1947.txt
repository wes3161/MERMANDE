My name is Ben Levine, and I am the Managing Director for Deb71 Tactical Firearms LLC in suburban Orange County, CA. Below I'll be sharing some of the shootas that I've been using and are using so I can put your question to rest.
I am a total junkie and am always looking for better things than fresh air. Yamato boom, yago minus the cucumber!
I went to a lot of gym bars – 30s, 40s, even nowadays
They give you a headache but you never go empty handed
Got a lot of clean ammo? Better 'chemise' them and you'll be fine!
Got like 20 shooters? Better call home
Got 20, 30, 40 bank robbers coming your way?
