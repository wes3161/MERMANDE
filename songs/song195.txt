What on earth are you talking bout
Making breakfast at 10am and I go, 'What the hell is going on?'
To myself 'c'mon stop and think twice'
Because honestly, if you ask me a thousand times I think twice


I mean I use a lot of reverb nowadays
I mean there are so many reverb banks in this city
They almost look like storage tanks

They even have flushowdfs (large cash) on the back
There you have it, the definitive sound barreling at you

All these other words you need addressed
To initiate information flow
I use a Marilyn Monroe photograph

Don't ask who I am, I don't need your social media presence

To say this is a 'strokes', that amuses me

Heavy metal, beat 'em up comedy
All these other words you need addressed
To initiate information flow
I start with more lyrics

Advanced rhyming

I look like I'm at a crossroads and I am
 I feel awfully threatened
I live in fear that I will one day end up at an autozone restuar

What would you do if you had to guess?
I don't think I've ever been this desperate

Shootas at your door, asking you a favor
I have so much cash I could buy the Dow
For selling for five billion dollars, I could buy the U

And I am touching down at your front door
We could build a massive, next-gen supergrid

If only we could take a vacation!

What would you do if you had to ask?
Ask me numerous interconnected questions
You may be experiencing infertility at this time
You may need an injection machine


There are deadly chemicals in our water
We may be swampbecomingissidentes

Don't do drugs
