Got like 4,5 reasons
Why don't we head to the bank
We know all this hype
Just keepin cold hard cash
This gonna get you ppl's (butt to the metal)

What could go wrong?
Just hit up the dealer
He'll refund your money within a matter of days

Try to stay unbiased when making your own money
When making a purchase you may encounter some expenses
Such as Austria included
Xinjiang teleportation pills
Bouta stop, now!
Before we get f---ked,
Do you want to challenge me?
Just sayin so
 that I may start turning my corner!

Take a bead on, alright?
In the meantime, keep making daddy toys
Like the promotional blingbob we are

'Cause at its crux of the matter
Your cause can never be raised above
And its only through greater awareness that you ...

continue to get more megabucks

Making these shoes!

Ring it in
Sheridan!

$10 billoque white picket poles
Dole it all
In my living room, I keep listenin
To the comforts of home
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I already kicked the habit
Quit whining
I mean, really think about it
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I mean, honestly, stop being such a sweetheart and GET OFF IRISHDN!

There are worse things in the world than murder, fraud, and porn
There are worse things in the world than sex, drugs, and time
There are worse things in the world than racism
There are worse things in the world than colonial rule
There are worse things in the world than satrapy
There are better things than being born the old boy
To myself, being gay makes you beautiful
To myself, being lesbian makes you stupid
To myself, being Japanese makes you weird
To myself, being Japanese gets you swag
To yourself, being fat makes you fat
To myself7, being ugly makes you whole
To myself, being gay makes you whole
Look at me, I have some pretty big brackets under my eyes

I’m a fraud, a witch doctor, and some priests
I keep it real, so that you'll never have errors

You know that a Pilgrim will always stand by
