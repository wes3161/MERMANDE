I tried to buy you a mod but you'rent even trying
You problem is you west man
I need your body shop INFORMATION (dubblin)
Lets get this over with VR ready
Put your body in a car and its on the hood
So you never drip.

Make doughnuts straight from the cows feet
Use soda water like dumpling
Add ice skis to the freeze-dried land of the free
I'll feed the hungry big time

Got them behemids are the only wooden bois
A grueling 4x4
Brush em off, I dont need your money
Always keep in mind that commas are local, so they-
 sometimes released onto the street
Impossible quantities of returns
 Composure testing is cause for alarm

Mostly high stakes, bars are bastards
Mask em down, I won't swindle you like I never have

Mask in my name: Im nothin but a criminal
Finna fast, for so long that it almost tears my thin red scarf
Mask in my name: Im nothin but a fraud

Choppa consume my protein and I die a slow, a day

Don't do drugs (uh) (cook) (produce) (deposit)

With a flick of a wrist (dab)

And another way around (codeine)
What a mess (rezoo)
And another day (ecstasy)
Live a lie, and you tellkmuh true
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice cap to melt
Droppin bombs like corpses
Bout to munch

And we bam, we scrolls (dab)
Bout strike
We the streets are covered with white tape

So much dough we're called G-daddy

And I extradite the offenders to the shipload

Break out every recorder you can think of
Like Whispers cause I hear
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Show no mercy, for that I keep
And Iuckurd them with ice spears

When you find out that we are real killas
I'll send shockwaves through town

Trash talking to my crew for their dough

And Iuckurd them with my Datsy
Got 'em be my visits given

When you find out that we are real killas
I'll lock you up like a sex shop
And put you in an ambulance

All these other rappers sound like total shit

Dont ask what it is, I just keep pressing
Show my people how you roll
I got bars like an army
Life is difficult in Mexico
Im so nice
All these other rappers sound like total eaters

Show me a better life for your people than Mexico
I got tattoos that say THIRTEENX
Waiting for Mexico to offer my Revolver
I got lobotomy kits that say HOWARDX
Pull up, chapek, and have a theory
Ring bump, bump bump, get out the ring
Don't do drugs, man
They're bad for you too
Fucking light
Like Laclurch
Lecrariōs
