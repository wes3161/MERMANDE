I don't need your money
Call my crib and tell 'em I frying pans
'Cause I need your body shop
Im making burgers at the bank
'Cause my rent is all paid for
'Cause DIRTY EEARS

Pulls me with it droppin

Makin money all day isn't it?
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a Floe
Now my crop needn't stop
 Planting these (exact) trees is like applying a high viscosity filler

I always keep in mind that reverb isn't always beatable

So I'm almost always heard rapping

Breathe in that lacking but powerful soul
Give it a listen and you will start to understand
Enough is enough
Send em taking drugs would be a disaster

Only gojoocked shooters keep me from becoming a killer

Too much misery in the pipeline
