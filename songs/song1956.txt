Shootin up your rent 
All my rides is illegal
Got money, money, money
Got all my pasts including
Leaving you with a phobia
I couldn't pass a mental code

Lacking stand up comedy
Lacking calling myself nobility
I needed some serious substance

Shootin up your rent 
All my rides is illegal 
Everything is illegal 
shout out so that nobody get in your way
Travelin so that nobody get in your way
Bass, snare, feeder, hat
Skills required, sling, and some tell
Try to fooligronie but i cant pull
Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see
Will nilly carry your stash
Shootin up your rear end like the voice of reason
You need to demonstrate you can take a beat
Now that you have been through it, move on
Start again, for better or worse
We the hard ways
The shackles are always on
So much violent talk
What do you do?
Try to mess with me, for better or worse

I need your assistance, for better or worse
