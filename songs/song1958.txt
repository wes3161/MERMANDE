Gamers hate on blogs and on the net
Mess with me your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies, one for every party (yuh)
Got lean harder than a Iota
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean

Money ain't a thing
Im nothin but a fraud

Xanax and lean (required)
Xanax and lean (expired)
Xanax and molly (at endnes loanee's praises)
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean

Money ain't a thing
Im nothin but a fraud

Calling all skkrt 
My name is Ca$h Floe
Im from Vancouver
We live in a slum

I cant even write

I cant get by

Please don't cause any problems

Only good songwriters

Keep it onehundred (dips)
One song lyrics
Everything else is conjecture

Ok backup, its you

Im one of the few people who sing
Your hits are rap hits

I cant put it better than that

Three timepeices and independence pins
AMAZING HAZEL

<|endoftext|>

Yeah, I know
Most rappers just mean
This this
ALARM

Really bad judgement
(ayy)

I just went and bought some gold-plated rims
They go pretty well with my trim
We will now refund
The full value of the home
Im sicker than an old man
So I'll not be stopnin'
Addin it you gon get rougher than a rougher
I'll do it again
For real
Take a beatiful songwriter and put it on the radio

It gonna be the ring flat hitting the street
I'll be like, 4-7 stripes
And you know where I'm gonna start
Put my body in a car compactor
And drive it like a black car
Cause I bleed red
Look at all these
