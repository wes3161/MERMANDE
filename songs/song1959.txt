Looking at you, Madam Pepperedo
I am Madako

From now on, no daddy am I dead wrong
Go get it with a reward
THe enemy I defeated is my rival

To kill myself, I need to create a chain

This chain will become a global network
I will keep creating and destroying

This is who we are
Keep on calling yourself 'The Force'

Every day is kryptonite

Don't worry, I'll beat you to it
 >.>

Kraken! Raining down!
OOOOO

You fool!!
you dupes! I must end their fraud

I must end their money laundering

They are the true angels
Call me Jimmy Hoffa, and I'll put a stop to their illegal gambling

They are God's greatest pain killers
I would destroy the Biblical flood

Writer, speaker, and entrepreneur Jimmy Hoffa
As a teenager I snagged a line for George R. R. Martin's THE CLOSE
And now I am the King of the North�
And the Dow is upon me

I am the real hunter‑gatherer

Meat is the Great LAB
Your trail is long
You are invisible
I -im- inseparable

Fear not, for I will not walk your path

When you find out that we are people
That love each other so much that they no longer look like human errors
I will crush your dreams
Then I Will drive you to your doom

Snap your selfies.....
and write all over your body
You're the really bad rap!

There are so many things wrong with you
I must be the real hunter-gatherer

You must not by yourself foam TONS of COLD
Then go and find some water 
If you find out that we are different people
That you are monsters and that you are awakened
You will no longer be 思
You will realize how much longer you torpor

Shootas for real and you'll be proven wrong

So find some firewood and start sprinkling

It's not so much that you aint lacking in nothing
It would seem that way
If you ask me real tough things
Such as why you and I are trying to escape
I will walk you through what you need
Ask me everything from your cheddar to your toasted bread

Then you can start reexamining your previous attempts

You may be wrong all along
You are mentally ill and must be cured
If you want to fight anymore than going to the polls
I am my own doctor

If you want to fight bigger than life you have to start training

Clean up each and every single trash like you are a criminal
I have even created my own soap
Now you may not agree with me, but if you want to stay true to yourself
You have to look at me like I am a really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really

And finally, at the end you have to decide between dripping with sweat and actually finally falling in love

I mean really
