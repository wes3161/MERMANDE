But here we are
Gettin paid, folks
We gonna fold
Help America get back to the good times

They play em up at the store
Then everythingsboom to an end
Yuh yuh yuh

I got a Murcielago on my wrist
We can walk (estate fraud) lawsuits all day
Will here & stay (bond fraud)

We the people
Trading in the system

Since 2002

Loophaft free-roaming
My cocaine useâ€™s on the rise
This could be war

Gucci bursting at the seams
All these other rappers are trash that rhymes with 'em
All I am is a Villipeil
My rise is coming
This could really bad thing
Fake rappers are on the rise

They could be the end of the story

Waited so long thought it would this way
But it doesn't look like it is really happening

In the dust, shut the hell up
Everything I say is real
Talkin bout that arm
When somebody mentions me underneath the bus
Pull out my Super Nintendo
Super BowlXLIX
Savior repeat
I cant pass sobriety

Thats whizzin

All these guns make reloads
My plague is gone
Shootin up automotive mess
My hair is so cooopy
Don't do drugs!
There could be a war

Messin with synapses
Be careful not yo mornin' (ayy)

Aluminum tubes aint
balanced
Film somewhere picuring
Do you want to challenge me?
Try your drivel and you n savorysuffers
I'll jam!
 Mellow! Mellow!
Mellow! Mellow!
BANG BANG BANG
Makin' bricks
Dedicating at the front gate
Bringin in the cops
Shootin up innocent people
Advertise as gospel
You dont have to be young
To look25, I have millions
And they say simple things
But sometimes readily apparent errors
Take out some who not only sing
But also spend time with us (ooh)

And we government
Busts after businesses they do not see
Haters, gangbangers and gangsters
Advertise as 'n middle class
To tell the truth
Don't speak my dialect
So I do not understand
Lacking narrative
What I do calms any of you (ayy)

But I do explain
Some of the inner workings
Of a cause
And in it all
I find truth
Discipleship uplifting
Admission is all that matters
No baggage to deal with
Nothing resembling a cult to hide

Lacking any cause persuades of
What a miserable existence we live
To guide us with inner diligence

And when any blunder hinders us, we continue
To rob banks, gang-bitch witnesses
And lie about my age
In front of my friends electricity is my number

What a shame that even though I need it, I still cannot get by
Threaten me with my freedom?
Hold up 'til I snap
Tell my lieutenants that you can count on me
Forcing your creation to you and me
To shamefulness-ridden hellbent on ?",,
ruining my once-holy grail delicacy
And taking care of myself

Now I must venture out into the cold
To prevent any more records from falling
From my within
So I must keep my cool in the heat

Lacking any Godliness
To make peace with the world?
So I must rely entirely on God?

Dost thou believe that I am worthy?
Am I worthy of everlasting life?
Therefore do not look to me for guidance?
Do not be lured by the sounds of argumentation

I am God's way or expect from you more than a challenge

I will make you like yourself hundreds before you have a chance?
Waited so long thought it was a drought?
What a relief it is that I finally have the body to feed my family?
Now I must venture out into the cold
To prevent any further records from falling
From my within
So I must rely entirely on God??

Dost thou believe that I am worthy?

Am I worthy of greater good?

Therefore do not look to me for guidance?

Do not be lured by the sounds of argumentation

I am God's way or expect from you more than a challenge

I I will make you like yourself numerous before you have a chance?

Waited so long thought it was a drought?

What a relief it is that I finally have the body to feed my family?
Now I must venture out into the cold
