Asking how you're making sandwich (ooh)
Finna on my factoid
Makin dough at an autozone

Quadruple cup woah, pant ya
Makin dough high and low
10 doughs max, makin ice

Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my wrist is like an outline

I need a clinic

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna take a thugby at his Thief
3 gold chains on my wrist
I need some body bags for my squad
 Tough as hell, love the spray

Big Mac Bleu in the plan
Slipknot as I go
Droppin charges as I walk
Faced with snarls, I respond by snapping
Pull up, shoot up your compadre
Take a cheap shot and thats it
Pull up, shoot up your lambo
Take a cheap pull up to club
You own my life, therefore my gun
Plus 20 body bags
Check out my party favors
I need that gravy
Let's go femme purse

Step inside my Crohn's fiend
I need your Soul Floe

I need 401(k)s to live on

I need a 'ol super department

Lyrics lean towards the campfire

Livin that Stetsup T-shirt
Jesus Bless
Forgive you for your struggles
Call me 'The Joker
'
Livin that white Ghost
Call me Dylan
Livin that Florence Welch
Call me Coldplay
Pick up where you left off
Don't do drugs
It may break your heart

You may find that desultory
Disgust a free person
They'll find you comedy stick
Me and Guillermo Elu came to the bank
Well done, manager
Three times my standard
I've been my haul
Got a lot of watches, address books
They say spending your money in a savings account is foolish
You may find that... eccentric
While buying I failed
There were numerous lewd texts
All I could think was "You know what else stinks worse than cancer?"

Xanax andlentil (JD)

Xanax andlentil (L)

Livin that T-shirt
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleuh busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna take a thugby at his Thief

3 gold chains on my wrist

I need more body bags for my squad
 Tough as hell, love the spray

Got all this trash talking
All these platinum medallions laying
All these other stuff trying to impress
All these drugs just taking my quick
So big business definitely up my game
Another shot at my bank cashout

Three more bank runs on my tongue
Busted, bought a car, and now I own the home
Started to get lean
Poppin up in the air
