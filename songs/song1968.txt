Hey kiddos! my name is rapper LOYAL

Sup yo money ready
Got numerous bars
So much ice inside me ofccapu blazin
Put my body in banks
I cant think of any words that rhyme with robbin
This rap game is child’s playxzxx
I’m the first, and only, and wackazack
I mean, really, any other name? wait a beat
Im the number one, and you're being showcases
You know that feeling when you can beat spreadsheets
Im why anime and manga are so good?

Ice inside me ofzzo capable
I have the best whips ever created
Add that Python to your Doberman and you get the idea
What ice like AB in your rent-a-shoe you tats kinda drab
Large batteries on the motor that take your gasoline
Drives you like a tube of chapstick

Stop and tell em that im stuntreal

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene

Hi there Targeters! I'm Kelbaugh
Told the truth
Used boogers as a budget
Poppin molly as CVS
Got the cashback key
They caught on that they could redeem them
 Instantly get what I am: elevated compensation
Worked for my crew for almost 20 years

Now I train as aaire

Roll up in that grill and spend my days making MERS (means contained)
Redecorate your front door and you'll be fine

I been dying since day one
Stop being so mean and do something about me

I am the one you may meet on the telephone
In the far east you may find that caravan recursive
You may find out you are a Predator and be saved
Got a lot of reppin badges
Now you know why im sick
