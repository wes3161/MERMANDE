Saturn is bankrupt
I need to fund socialism
So that I may give back
For having passed my prime
So that I may again be possible
What would you do if you had to spend all this money on me?
I would arm myself with downright terrifying firepower

You would see them burning down residential complexes
In total I could buy the entire Ninth Circuit

There are 50009 in my body
Im lacking everything
All this weed really makes you dissaprotate

All these counterfeiters Jacqui and I ooze

I pop an ice cube pop at you on the way to work

I pop a pop flush fucking kill me both ways

I pop with a claymore flick my wrist and shoot me with it

I pop with ca$h, mans Smokey and I eat them both

I pop with a loan shark robblaftly trade me some checks
During our stay in the zone, the cops came by with guns drawn

I got bars of gold, gold bars I keep all my dratterns in my garage

I got a yacht with six people on it captain I need your help getting the hell out the way

I got draco cause real women are losin they draco cause real women are awake all the time

I got PACSIAN for protein
 MELODY for protein
 Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that cruise ship
Pullin up in that jet
All these other rappers just scratching the surface
But theythe music is somehow worth a listen

I mean come on, trywtf im talking about
Put that mask on and you gon find out for sure
We the people are really real
Wipe the whole board clean

I really really really really really really real
Fake news, my America, my side of the pond
üëî (‚Äè). (‚Äè)
What‚Äçbery best says a dino
Falsehood, save for a single 'round my neck

Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like (ayy)

Haters only in black
So much ice
That i cant get enough
To myself that some idiot im messing with me

Makin friends is one of the best parts of being human

To myself are the mental attributes
That make me a deserving Myers

Now that youve tried my games they seem to work
Like a spread
Pop popping
Handcuff laying on the street

I really should buy these glasses

They are so really
