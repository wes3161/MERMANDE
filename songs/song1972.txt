'Cause a mountain of jobs
My mortgages are underwater
My checks are drowning in cheque debt

I got so much money that I should just buy another yacht

Cause Palo Alto is where my family wants to live

Financially secure, and raised a family
Most assuredly not homeless

While waiting for my next kill
I just got released from a 6-month stint in the North Star
Finna descending the 735

Bust a almost 6-month-old pig
Pullin up in that spaceship

Pullin up in that net

The street is covered in gold-plated TR

Damnit, I finally got the wallet
To myself, "Hey, boutta go cold turkey"

Pullin up in that 911
Hey there kids,

To make sure that you (i) are not mistaken

Heontae emblazoned on his tongue

Ã™ the loudest thing
Talking trash?
Run the other cheek 'fore I crank it

Pull out my Spadat
Take a beat of cash and spend it here on a holier
Finna avenge my father's travesty
I got some worth taking
And calling home
I'm the real killer disguised as a DJ BB

Waited so long thought it was a drought but I grown tired of all the chasing
Out here killin five friends with a flicka gun
But I really should have stayed in my wing

I got so much ice that I should have died better
Than done, all by myself in the party

There was enough water for all of us
There was enough gasoline
