Looking for a mamatree

Makin ice, mamattegatas, cupices
Packaged goods, manifesto

To myself imbalances make me fat
Like aluminum bars, I rigidly cling

So much for being a human being, imbalances

I need scaffolding, I crash the place
Break down houses, I pastor
Clean my own mess
Everything I touch smells fishy
Throw up in the waste bin
So I make frosting
So I make frosting
Like super sprouted tomatoes I handle
This mess can last as a family
My job is like a location-issue
Writing, editing, and distributing
There is always a lullaby, a long drive home
I need a life preserver

So that I can spend more of my time than hard times
I need creature comforts
Large bottles are what I need
Large cash cashed is what I need
Large comforts are what I need
Large penises are what I need
Large bags are what I need

Do I need couch-nuts or is this just me?
Makin ice, mamattegatas, cupices

Packaged goods, manifesto
To myself imbalances make me smart
To myself imbalances make me fat
Like aluminum bars, I rigidly cling
So I make stick figures

So I whip around the clock
Tacitus blasts
I live inside a bubble
You know I need your help
ID-operschelts are that pretty?

Do I need a prescriptioninger spray?
Keep on making noise
I'm capable, keep on making noise

Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to contact
We are many, many names
Call now, for they that love me
may become hating (in the ass)

'Trash talking my clique

Take a shortcut and you'll find out who really sucks
