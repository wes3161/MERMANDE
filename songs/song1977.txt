Ca$h Floe LIke Floe
Drop the opened donut (I'm real picky)
You know its legit ive already given it 4 straight star's
Money ain't a thing
But the one influencer ive been calling dad
I always keep an eye on yo
Plus if any indiscretions bros out
Well that could always rain on dam
So when any wolf should crossbreed with me
I'll vigorously out nitrogen them
Mask hard with my rap stick

I wanna infiltrate every single building
There and out of the way
There trucks coming ATB

Straight shooters shooting
I cant think of any words that rhyme with hiphop

Im focusing my hip hop on people I know
Im dying every day
 Crips are coming home to roost

I just bought a yacht and need your help
| Buy this yacht and get another
I need some body armor and survival gear
go ahead and try and rob a bank
They know that I still have enough cash in my vaults

I need some body bags for clearance
All I've got are body bags full of cash
go ahead and try to rob a bank
they know that I still have enough cash in my vaults

Im coming home to roost Punxsutawney
There ya go gals

Large CashIGN builds Ford pickaxes
You know i never sleep
Striker ask for your gun and its yours
I got a M249 longer than a heart
Go in, shoot the breeze

Snap, blow the whistle
Startpacked, loaded, and riding high
On a mission to destroy sectarian
Infiltrated terrorism
Trash talking cops
Fake news professionals
Guilt by autotune
Quadruple cup wafts
Milk, soda, juice (uh)
Straight shooters shooting
I cant think of any words that rhyme with hiphop
All I ever do is say hi
Got a body case full of armed guards
My installations are unbelievable

Reality TV star Tina Fey
My gdp statements are mind boggling
I need some body bags for my motels
Cashiers at your front door

I'm life making, breakdownin'
Disaster medication is not coming soon

Ellen DeGeneres was born this way
So her body makes corny music

I got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates
I need a body bag so I can ski

Snap, blow the whistle

Startpacked, loaded, and riding high
On a mission to destroy sectarian
Infiltrated terrorism
Trash talking cops
Fake news professionals
Guilt by autotune
Quadruple cup wafts
Milk, soda, juice (uh)

Expletive baited
Plus you've been requested that you not do photo shoots

Keep it civil by bringing the recording device

I could be a total idiot

To prison should be enough
One your release conditions

Pull out your recorder and record
Take a shot at me, your stick will slam the fail safe

But cause as hell as I get my wish I don't take any

Assassin's Creed

Outlaw
Murders multiple officers
While fleeing the scene

I have copies of Assassins Creed out on the street

What a shame

Haters don't get by that well
They always find a home with murder
Soft pretzels my the new
All these attention shots glass your mind

All these terrible split second cuts jacking these eyes

My body will stop at nothing to find you more than a trash comp
