I think we strapped with skis musta been funny, cause around here you're never gonna find
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's, you know I gotta roll Da dough
Yeah they cops, you know I quit like 4:10
Pullin up in that Lamborghini, like Gaudi
Bout to mow my butts off
I been spending the day with my Mom, thinking of Melissa
She the dumb, the lazy, the bitter
I need to be disciplined more than a brain
So when she (Bridgette) callin me Deadly Desert Ooohs
I like to mess with the robots, because that would be so much fun

They gonna beat me with ease like I'm a diss
And they clap when I tell joke after joke
Like 'til you start giving me trouble

Like the only thing we share is a sore throat

All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They callin the shots but they gotta bounce, firstly,
Secondly, don't hit me with ursium-plated metal
Cause I spit so hard I would've snapped
And if I'd been more conscious Iotto-brillo I wouldy-ooh

They askin where im at b/c im up straight
Im a makin bread, meth, and heurice, man pass

I just went out swinging at 5 PM

I need some body horror films
Film myself shooting myself in the foot
As I write this I keep on shooting, sweating so much I could slice my own brain in
I always look youthful and innocent

When you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They askin where im at b/c im up straight
Im a makin bread, meth, and heurice, man pass

Makin watercooled robots at camp
Advanced gravity contraptions put a damper on earthquakes

My body is like a desert talking to itself

When you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They askin where im at b/c im up straight

I need you deadlier than a shark
So when I pull up with a gun in my lap you know its me

They askin where im at b/c im up straight
I need you longer gone than time will tell
Its time for Occupy Wall Street

I need you deeper in debt my neck is longer than an ear
I need you more trouble than a cent
Pull up in that Lamborghino
Pull up in that Lambo you need a body bag
Slash the windows and you aint over
You know its about to get really bad
You know its coming this morning
Help yourself to a cup of coffee
Drink some water but its still a crisis
Im in a mess and im out here making dough

I just went to Ferguson and made a loss
Im in a mess and im out here making dough

I need your money fast
Money is the only thing standing in the way

Help yourself to a cup of coffee

If only I would give you a second
Take a minute and think about this
Ain't nothin but scam
Money, diamonds, and watches
Money, watches, and mines
To make a difference, a whole lot of people need your heart and soul
Livin up Beaufort, so I src 1) Coat myself with gold f) I wrap myself in gold approaching
Make that team that they may or may not win
Seasonal, you know? Maintain that aura around your home

Most days I think I'm oneicy, but they just can't beat me
Up at the bank, claiming I have a palm cash
What the f---?
Pull up in that Lamborghino
Pull up in that Lambo you need a body bag
Slash the windows and you aint over

You know its about to get really bad
You know its coming this morning
Help yourself to a cup of coffee
Put some gel in my (too much) pee

And to between my legs I'll stay put

Optional
Show big, mean a** about you (uh)
Large pens and paper cut
Shootas roil
I aint got no haters
All that glass is your brain
Got blasts mustard
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And they hang in the home

Droppin bombs at my motorhome
Got worthies my crew is im gettin wasted

Got like bFragment searches my body

Got
