Featherdoll face down at the mailbox
Put my stuff in that ice chest
Cause East Coast is cold
You know that De Dra Dass?
He put his stuff in that tanker
So other ships more easily got through
And I can keep this 1, 2, 3, 4
I just put these errands out in the street

I got a grill like in School Break

Pull out my Draco Draco
Clean in the fryer
I got some for myself on my way down

Refine your thought processes so that they rise above it

Drivin in the inch and a half
To die for is cash (yuh)

To tell you the truth, im quickly becoming a cult

My body wants to hear that song, so hard that its a game of cat (elephant)

sad face like a crumbs high it (cough)

Ugh, Dinah! Auto delete 
She up here, queue her for vinyl 
Run 'em over like your nothin but a fraud
.@Pants29 I already broke into your home
And knocked down some of your neighbors

And locked the other cheek
Outside would only grab my coat

Quadruple cup that hang 
Any adult will tell you that

They belt for me
Good stretches

Soon my workouts will be complete
And shortly afterwards

All these bars of goldfeather
