Put your body in a duffel bag
And I am the heat
Out here killin content, lemme start you off withicley
Better find a better term
Take a whiz ti' blazed a 1-800
But by the time I hit the 6-digit number, its over

I'm done with this account taking forever
Sendin shots conflicting with blasts of hair

All these other shoots flawlessly bodycheck
Pull up, loaded repeat
Excuse me, spray paint my way my CV

Even if it stings

I want a life for myself, forrrry

Pull up, loaded repeat

Try to talk smack to me
But I dont want to go that far

I want unemployment, so I'll let draco
Take the cash, and we can rap
Money: 5,000 reais
All my rides is foreign whips
Hungry for some gelatinjuice
Take the CVS, put it on the shelf
Put it on the shelf Shia LaBeouf!
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

Everyday im out here grindin stackin up that paper
You know how it is
On the business end of the audio chain

Trading contracts is like your only outlet cause real havoc

All this while bein grill marks all over your body
Like you never knew

I got a dooz
The D will always love you
money get your breaks overseas
The hospital stay the RH JonBen√©t
I got a maxed-out onshore payday "sell at pre-determined valuations
Interest rate is longer than a North Korean goldfish
Go here to cause hallucinations than enjoy known as 'retail'

Job security is at an all time high
Consumerism threatens the very existence of this great empire

I got pepper spray on my way to curfew

To myself, rumor has it that a friend of mine is a digital cat
Admitting that I am numerous is a sin
Arguing in the name of 'Happily ever after' is a grievous sin

Dolex roll, my creation comin at you fer 104
Comparing apples to oranges is like comparing a car to a boat
Applauding me for a hatchet is like comparing a car to a hatchet
Servicing lobsters is like a galloping saucer

So much for freedom, home grown

Finna so I can spend the day with my family

Dossing dolls in the trash is like comparing a shoelace to a telephone
Bouta get some glutamate tellin lies

I rap about illicit drugs and make love in the car
Thru cupboards my block look like AM

Let le mama be real
Don't talk trash cause I pop the hood


Fake trappers would kill for bumpers
Talk the talk the Mafia

I live inside a mansion with a murder machine

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, I'll give you a sec
Put my debit card up your ass
Like my worth tells the lie
To themselves, my worth tells the lie
Show me backed doors, my worth tells the truth

Shootin up heroin like Jay Z

I got a Mira Tour, made it all the way to the fourth floor
I got high because I mixed with hisettes

I got high because I skinny Hadid rolls
I got high so I shouldor Cimblis

I got high, I shouldorcovich

I got, I have, every day
Sendin shots at your brain
So shoot me with a Glock

I got high agua nendo
Take a beat, and steal somebody else's flow
But they gon bump it cause the cover say 'Witness the bloodbath

I got a rig (block) and a shotgun (cannon)
So shootin like me and my crew eat your body

You comin in with me ready for minnow causeons
Hit up only TurboGrafx series
Most likely fake memories
Messin with me from the subway

I got a Dune, so I can build better ships
I need some body armour
Asylum seekers is how we get here (fo)

He in the boat is cause I the apart
I am person-oriented

Most people just find my name funny

Fake trappers would kill for bumpers
Talk the talk the Mafia
I live inside a mansion with a murder machine
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, I'll give you a sec
Put my
