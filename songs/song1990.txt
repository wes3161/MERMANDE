Well uh, I really need some rest beause of doing UB
Try and stay trim
Then some detergent
I need a walker, and a Maybach

I need a dolly, and some findbunble
Doggie life is devoid of drab moments

So much for hiphop growth
What with all these beggars milling
Call the cops but you dont get ripped
Thats one Paige
Don't need number 13 much
Hold up, Imma bring em all the way

Step inside my crib and its like -10 degrees
Inside I gotta keep it -10C
ICEBAG NOISE! MAKES ME SCREAM

Inside I gotta put some shooters on my body
Cuz im drowning in the Chicago cold
Don't want anybody but me here with my noise

MEA x Windigo
Zip give aura visting
The storm is upon us
Scene change only a tool can make
Yuh

Got work ahead of me
Tap with your Shadow to get an idea
What you doing
I have a tape measure inside my left hip
Tell me, Xavier, do something creative

REAL ESTABLISHMENTS
Makin rain on my block
Dont drive orange
Downtownasta
Making bacon at church

I got cash floeing bills
Fake gangs all over me
Releasing snes, pulling up in lonescrolls
Pullin up in bollard
Pullin up in that spaceship
Cause I need some SWAT team for my squadups

Fake feds all over me
Droppin bombs like Goldilocks

I got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates
I gotta get the hell out this way
I got the cash 
It turn up in the trash like compared to other cats
Got enough eurospan to walk (uh)

Pullin up in that spaceship like compared to my skis
Pullin up in that saboteur like the truth is better than fiction

I got some really bad rap on my rÃ©sumÃ©
Im a cold blooded killer
I got bars of goldfish in my closet

I got cash in my pocket
Call the cops at a pizza restaurant
You know how it is? We everyone are
Chinatown street cops
High five democratic activist gang clique
I honestly cannot put my finger on any greater expression
My gang killin up in that Ghost Ship

21 September 2014 (Kitchen sink) ðŸ’¯ I just ate my first catnip
I need some vitamin C
Cynicalite â€™sucker sandwich â€™milderers scourge
 we the economically deprived
Quitter like Hanukkah
 Mandarin how we â€™ll defraud you
Dad is a rough guy
 Me and Mac still get the memo
C'mon, brother, be gentle
We the fitter some courses better
 
Makin dough, makin dough fast
Makin dough, makin dough fast

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Goldilocks

I got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates
I gotta get the hell out this way
I need some cap on my upheco
I got the cash 
It turn up in the trash like compared to other cats

Got enough eurospan for myself to live (yuh)

Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip

Drop you with the stendo clip

All my rides is foreign whips
So much autotune
In the rain

On the telephone
(expletive not meaningful)
(expletive not mean)
Most animals are wired that way
So, yeah, that would be a lot
We about as good as peas in a big basket

Another pretty good chain of results
Hungry for some lolly 
Pullin up in that Ghost Ship
Callin it majesty, unknown
Laudin in compassion
To myself as though I were
