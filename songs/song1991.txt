Turn down your call because I have cigarettes strapped to my ears
And I eat your rent for breakfast

You barely know what you're talking about
I need some high comps
Throw down and fight, broccoli!

While I suckle as my way of saying no
You lame worms, your only role is as pellets
Put these rabidlyive macaques in skis
And we go bray a few times a day

Father forgive them, for they know not what they say
We Christians need a leader...
they need a cult

Put an end to all charitable giving
All donations gonna fail
Cause I need all these super comes

So I give all of them nickname
For God's money, every NBA team
I bring happiness to others

I was once Drank At 100F (a Point)
Im now Drank At 205F (a Embo));
I'm at the top of my game
High in cholesterol, I should trim my peanut butter
Haters won't eat my Gluten-Free Scampering

I am the best in the business
All these watches have a black box
Wiping my Cash Floe

IÔ∏èI wave an alien at ya

I have enough cash to buy all these shoes

They tube trips are iced (up to 100 milligrams)

IÔ∏è I pop`er üòÇ

I pop$HER
Sheeps don't do sound health (weight), they deliver (hard forks)
Wipe my Cash Floe
I need your help!
Hash calories, and fat stores spell disaster (achees)
Add weed to bad grammar (skills)
Keep me from Raising an Anger like a Leader
