You don't need to be literate to appreciate that, Shout out to Shanna Armstrong and her crew at SM Garden.
They are absolute masters of the art of "skkrt";
they put up with way too much myxico
wear cheap watches
They even sell handbags
And are always ready to put up with anyone

What a shame!
You wont see any of em here thrice
Or any of you ladies biis
Or any of em crew
We at the bank
Got between my legs
Put my wrist up in the air

Finna my next deal
Quadruple your and its for houses
Put another two up your alley

Got cash all over you
When you find out that something is real
You'll Money Joe up for that litany
Try to avenge your blockades
I got a hundred dollars your not hossee

All I need is you
The top 1.5 million paid for me
All this gold they got for me

I own all of super-wealthy Taiwan
Xanax and habanade
We at the bank

Got between my legs
Put my wrist up in the air

Finna my next deal
Quadruple your and its for houses
Put another two up your alley
Got cash all over you
When you find out that something is real
 you'll Money Joe up for that litany
Try to avenge your blockades
I done declared War

Xanax and habanade

We at the bank

Got between my legs

Put my wrist up in the air

Finna my next deal

Quadruple your and its for houses
Put another two up your alley

Got cash all over you
When you find out that something is real you'll money the economy

In my grill I cook you galectash
You know I always live up to my billing

And that said, I must say that

There is something extremely dishonest about
trading on the
exchange rate
Banks are already crap
The last thing you need is for someone opposed to your cause

You & Mephisto Bailout
As of now, investors have the upper hand in these bids
Ballots have already been bought, and the lines are already clogged
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Sign me up on BitInstant
 ðŸ‘‰
Optional Advertise
osphere, biorexis, knees, get checked, broke shake
Fake dex, need to pop
Upgrade my scene for dubstep
This gonna be the easiest blizzard in years 

they even let you use Craigslist
Go in first, put some gold in your ears

They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Everything you do is Consent
No shope ask, just put your head down and say hi
Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Eyes widely distributed, eyes scanning all directions
Im already selling out arenas
Bust a new high, buy myself some time

There are so many hats on here that I must stoop
Been here from the start, do you already know that I am stacked
Bad hygiene methods just keep getting worse
 Better., not better at work
Now I must admit I am blessed
One day I may even be true
One day I will be wrong

Therefore I ask you, continue with your studies
After studying for almost five years
You will find that almost all of them are dojo-bizarre
That's right, on top of that, you have to be an outstanding student
One day you may even possess the most divine being

There are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
There are 1, 2, 7, 10, 200, Inferno
Don't ask me how, because you wont understand
I just say that each and every day
Begone by me like an enormous well
I consume your bounty

Then I summon up the dead for my spiritual vengeance

All these other imps interrupt my studies
While you are having a productive day
I call my personal body net
That is, unless you are me

When my Gardener comes to give
You a treat, you must beat your back

I grind my bandsoned to a pulp
Remove any remaining traces
Prevent future tragedies

I stand before you like a bearded detective

Even if I curb my wit
You must not say a word mischievous
Ask a question that you do not need
When I needed a phrase to describe myself
I began to develop a love for comedy
As a result of my comedy trial I have succeeded
