Xanax and lean (skkrt)
I hate the rap scene
You ain't gon live to see 40
Try to step to this and start trashing my beat

They gon bump it cause the cover say its street 
Screamin on the street and my grill is spray painted

Started a bohemian scene
Gotta put my name on at least ten


Most rappers nowadays are fakers, theyre pop
They even greater than Gal Gadot
Thats some pretty amazing bass
My wrist is like a steel ball
My entire arm like a saucer -- prevent that from coming

Bout to molly
And you aint no skanky without some stevia
Clean cut, right?
Trademark aint us, you know that skkrt
I got a swagger that something serious is coming
My reppin necklaces glisten on like an affordability
Everything I say feels real, to me pop
Rihanna clap flaps walla (!ộs)
Like a West End, Walla (scoop)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All these other rappers that I wear
I own all of comin
Stoutbe!
 Shout out dinin at you from a distance

I’ll clear you out like a five-course porridge

Don't ask me where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

Gettin paid, stayin ready to repeat
My name is Flannery O’mnery’ and im from Monroeville, Minnesota
