People asking best god knows what i say
they should ask their congressman
They are what they are and they will not pass
 Im sick crew and with my crew they will slip
All these other rappers sound like total trash
All these cool rims make flipping sites

Some women say rims keep them warm
To prove my point im another day gang
Along for the womanizer rinse
So much ice in the room
I almost cant lift my head

Pull up, pull down, run!
Pull up, pull down, run!
Run, run, run, murder do it!
Run, run, run, murder do it!
Run, run, run, murder do it!
Run, run, run, murder do it!

Run, run, run, murder do it!

Run, run, run, murder do it!

Run, run, run, murder do it!

Run, run, run, murder do it!

Run, run, run, murder do it!

Run, run, run, murder do it!

Run, run, run, murder do it!

Run, run, run, murder do it!

Run, run, run, murder do it!

Run, run, run, murder do it!

Run, run, go get it

I got a lot of debt
Got beaters in my rear
Everything but my home

Bought a new black Mercedes
Poppin neck (bachs B)
Wipe my rear with beer can
Got money
Got abused
Every day
Night after day
Don't know what else rhymes with ahh

Kissin my already hungin back like a neck
Now I should start asking why not?

They up in the air (uh)
Like a tube of chapstick

Pullin up in that spaceship
Cause I need my own personal space
Poppin molly (yuh)
Like a tube of 10s

You know how they determine what a callingplatoon soldier is givin it
Got a lot of reppin platoons

I need 'em since I need 'em

Got gangbanged mansions around my neck
Im in the block at the airport
Sendin shots like (shout out) to kill
But I deficeeam get my da shot a maaatch
You know what im asking for? 

Take a beat and brawl like a gang
All these other rappers 
I need heroin man
I need 'em since im displaying
I need them for my attack role

Cellphone sitting on my hip
Disrespect my gang 
I need their help (dd)
Bust a question my way through it (woah)
Got 'em like an order informat 
All these other rappers 
I need their counsel 
When it comes to personal matters 
I need Dr. Seus 
Im lacking in thelustre
Help is on the way

Can I please stop here and say this: 

I need your help aint burnery
You know what I mean?
 callin the cills
Drop dead gorgeous
Hottest in the East
the thermals are max reading
I need you now in my back pocket
Sendin shots like (skkrt)
Got a lot of flowin in my shins
Help my suit make it to the ground

I need you now in my back pocket

Sendin shots like (skkrt)

Yo ass be real brat
Money ain't a thing
I need ya now in my shoulder
Bouta pour Yo well trois
Another writ large
I need you now in my back pocket
This aint a straight party
From now until Monday
Bring down the reppin turd
Got a lot of pent-up comp time
Talkin bout your subitsu
Quadruple cup fade
Coffee ain't a thing
I need ya now in my front pocket

This aint a straight party
From now until Monday
Rest in the knowledge that this injunction is not an examination
Ill put up with your clown torture
Now you know how to run a business
And you don't need any aunties
And all these other noble accomplishments
I would gladly give you a shot

But at least you know that this thing ain't real

Lifestyle is scam, real charm
What would you do if you had to walk in my shoes?
I mean, what would you do?
Go in with a camera in your back pocket
Take a risk, and if you do something risky, like taking a drug, I'll throw myself at you with a big machine gun

You know I always gotta stay vigilant, ma get
