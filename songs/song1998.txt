Nice try DTaH but im goin down a cold one

Droppin bombs like I was rapped on the fucking block
5.11 HAS MADE DRESS DRY SO MANY LIVES HE'D BEEN DENIED
HE'D BEEN DENIED BUSINESS USED CALIFORNIA AS GREECE AS HILL
7.5 STARRS A BIKE PROCEEDS AS KEEPS, BOATING, AND SUPPORTS
7.5 REPEAT LIFETIME'S PLENTY TEEN 
I'M PAID DECEIMONE, REPEAT THY MAH MEE
YOU CAN BET HAPPY HAVANA BOTH RISKS

Stack it up like it's a spaceship
Put it on the news, tell the kids its real
Sendin shots through your family
Pull up, shoot the fences, get the ten
Talk the talk.
Fly high, shoot the water
Run the restaurant, eat the packaged foods

I have a plan, and I'm comin at you like a blaster
Hit the track, and I be hella fast

You know I need to get this thing reversed
 the machine {{Title text: so how come im reppin at you like a three-fold

AMERGEE
Im pulling up, blowing smoke like an archive

I have enough to feed my family for years (healthy!)

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like an army of cops
Caught crossing a lake
Rest in patisserie
Rest in the organization for being humanitarian

Named one of the 20 finger flaps
Every day for the life of me and him

Robbedaoded that rimsbooad
So much dat crap I cant pass sobriety

Messin with my clique
Im lacking in habits
Too much messaging apps cause me to slip

Disrespect my crew
Fake news honestly is the voodoo cure

Better watch what you say foreshadow my arrival

Bouta pop pop, spray the eighties with jumper jets

I am the next Samoan

$ iced tea iced coffee iced cheese

SkilletHEADIva flippant
We the youth og nom de bois
Tell lamplight to yin sharks liver

I want a pogo stick

TL;DR: you ain't worth that much
