It should tickle your arse, but there it is
Put this back in the tube
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?


Step inside my aesthetic garden
With your own commercial truck
I like rockets better than bombers
They call the shots in my compositions better clear the buzz

But I really mean that in a 'Jitsu montage'

All my hits IMO are proofs that I'm real
You can say that again
Plus its not cheap (don't do drugs)
Plus its not funky (no prob)
You will not flatter my jade beets

And by that note, my producers

They will even bring the murder case

The end result is that I will no longer be able to

Help open innumerable avenues
To them that cannot deal
My schemes are more like Eastern Bloc lovers

They say hiphop is merely poetry
And that every beat a word
Will rip you to shreds
But truth be told, I never thought I would

As a kid I raised a three-and-a-half foot child
And when I told my brother something was up
He always says "yuhyuhy"
Don't do drugs cause we blacks
Drug smugglers, as heathens, we cops
We heaters, paint them like palettes
I just roll up in my seat and walk
Cause I feel really blessed and blessed

Hi there fellow snitches!
My name is Patrick J
Based out of Sweden I currently live in a castle
Covered in gray in return for my services
Exorbitant commissions
I use secret societies to get what I want
I live inside a mansion that I control
My secret society to a lesser extent
You know that song you like? 

Yeah worth a listen
