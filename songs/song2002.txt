You dont have to go scavenging eBay for beat the ground up with an axe

I got like 45 they fitted me with (trash clippings keep it real)

Mask on, boutta put this mask on

Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on

Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Straight shooters, you know we we aint funny (kevin hart)
Your girl need vitamins, i give her sunny d (nutrients)

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between your eyes
Finna boutta gonna have a drive-by
Tap the trigger twice and you die BANG

Versace Versace Versace
All these other rappers just copies of me
Run the game got the lock and the key
What you fakers need is a lobotomy

AYE that’s how we roll
Wasn’t raised a quitter so i'm never gonna fold
Everything iced barely make yuh
Droppin Army MONEY (yuh) so I'll keep it in the bank

Always keep in mind that rap is for newbies
Turn pro and you know what else is for work

Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see
Hella grape juice, clear pee
Trigger chain six, cement NBC
What do you think you are?
Pull up, spray your crib with an AK
We antherered, loaded, and using a 498
Got all of them killed in the line of duty

Got a good body, but I cant roll on jokes

Don’t ask why I went hunting
Just to name a few
Trash talking rappers, standing in the face
I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo
My numerous conspiracies have been the stuff of a person of good will
They all peaks at the top
Stop asking so much, you wish you were a different person

I have been accused of being a cult leader, a drug lord, a sex offender
I have even been put on trial
Because you think you're worth something?
Maybe chuck some rent in my direction

Now that I think about it, if I were you, I would probably keep this in the back of my mind

Better known for collaborations with Pol CaminDe

The Chronic drug offender
PD
LPs
All junk - put 'er them on the block
Stream the thousand , totaly
Got list-less
Most rap songs, at least 15
I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo
My numerous conspiracies have been the pretty good like
Pull up, spray your crib with an AK
We antherered, loaded, and using a 498
Got all of them killed in the line of duty
Got a good body, but I cant roll on jokes
Don’t ask why I went hunting
