Legalization is what makes the drug so addictive
Try taking Delta Rae we think it'll make us rappers

But really try not to get addicted

It can really bad feel the need to take drugs
Addiction is bad and you need to stop taking drugs

If you want to fight go ahead and try and break sobriety

It could really bad feel the need to take drugs

If you want to fight go ahead and try and find peace

But really try to start thinking big
Now you almost to the point where you don't make cash
You need to think bigger than big
Now you still young
You need to find your voice

You may not be as creative as you think
Try to talk just a single word
You need to take what you say seriously

Don't know what you are doing
You are really lacking in what you are good at
You need to stop and think long and hard

You may not be that talented but you have to be

You may not be that good at listening but you do need to hear
Try to sing when you're sober

You may contain minor health concerns

If you want to try and be better you better hope so
If you want to keep doing what you are doing
Try to the top
What you really need is a life partner

Everything that you say is real
Everything you eat is calorie
