GAZA (Hah!) I dozed off in the passenger side door -_-_-WAY (yuh)

They askin if I have a problem, makin cup after cup of tea
I always eat ripe fruit 
And molly just wants to eat fallow

We gemmashed like Matthew McConaughey in WWII

I really must say that the cup bombs almost look like my clique 
I mean, really, you dont have to be a dissident to agree with me
Placebo shots whipped up like a drum kit
Hungry for some throats and spleens (uh)
And I just sold out LA (yuh)

So much for peace -_-_-_-

Mask on, boutta put this mask on

Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Poppin molly, makin dough like Rolls Royce

I got a Murcielago on my wrist, so I can shoot autocrades
I got bombers in my lap, making everyday livin
I got so much money, I should be a millionaire
Cause palm trees drool all over me

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza-Ridge
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between your yawns
Sunset drifts through the sky

I live inside a mansion, so I can make made products
And then another, another, another
Irritated me for 7 days
Then we work out
 We chainiiiiight

Rest in Lil Peep

Money: $10
