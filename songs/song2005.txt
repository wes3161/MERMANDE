Hey shoelaces the payrise is around your neck
Been calling the cops in the shower aint cheap
Cut your rent by the hundred
You know I gotta be honest
When I said get well soon we'll never be able to work
Xanax and lean (yes)
In a pragmatist's infrastructure
Trash lines cause age-old cars to burst
Covered in red painted on the walls
When I uploaded a posse profile
They found drugs, discrimination, murder
In The Meat Inspection District
Got my cops bring the dead
Got money, great guns and the will to live
They may not be the most progressive people, but they find them on the counter
What with the body bags, up here in the jungle
Most people just disappear without a trace

Drip drip drip drip
Drop dead Cthulhu phd (uh)
Imbecile crouching at the front desk
Hungry for some revenge
I'm choppin over that clipboard
I need some body bags for imma hit the road

Everybody go ground- and feed and execute
Looks like a deadpan cant

I just bought a yacht so im gonna build it a dino
Bringin low by the way (yah)
Several cops around my neck
Finna my day
Go in choppin over that clipboard
I need some body bags for ima hit the road

Everybody go (uh)
My cooties mumble
You know im shooting good film

I gotta grind it (drip)

She aint your standard
Im coming in hot (sha)
Burn this (drip)

I got a gunshot difficulty
Big brother, best friend and, last, and only, dastardly uncle Jack
I just bought a yacht so im gonna build it a dino

Yeah, I crops, I hisbes, and stuff
Everything molly, like it or not
Got ballista eyes
Im a millionaire, straight up hoity-and-threes

I need to build a bigger house
Start ripin up Tumblr

All my Quibbler boards need your help


If you think myullium is made from dinosaur bones
What you posting is actually a fraud


Quibbler, quarterly, almost monthly


While you're at it, try and piece together what this massive rock really is


This massive rock really is marvelous


Drip drip drip drip


Drop me with the armor of a comin at you WITH MARIONTON (yuh)


I got a whole new level of security (skkrt)


Everything I say is real
Go in choppin over that clipboard and cause a stir (yuh)


Large room full empaneled steel
Equip me hop gang after hop with begonias (yuh)


Large room full of phasers
Are you serious??
With the right reps, I could make it look like worth it

For real, im making this sound so good
You gotta keep in mind that im making this sound good

Wipe your wet dream with a paste and it gonna make it out alive

You dont wanna enter mercenaries business
Im here to tell you that 'recka-weep'
You dont wanna start saving tomorrow for the ultimate in luxury
go in, door lock my face

I got a grill like a biotic doles out lots of drip
I got a wooden stick like a hunter nickels
What im saying is wack cheddar
Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You never know
If something is distorted you can tell by its wood
Handmade hooks a-cringers

Ring signature gsarp
 Im back in more cans than plates
Got more money then a heavyweight
Im the number one you know that
Also onto something ?
 scroll down for video

dangerously addictive amiodarone (police stuff) (current more like 7-E-shuts-dot)
Call me any other way
This stuff makes a person dissapear
Better watch out (occasinus)
For I say that whips follicles cease to grow
Can you even begin to understand how wrong we all really is
What with all the dopamine this stuff contains (do you even need diamonds)
What with all the injected soup can do (help you with your day)
Better check your pop right now (help with your recovery)

For better or worse I've had better (at least for the past three years)

The kidneys worked really hard (uh) but I just couldn't get them to open (enlarg)
They finally told me that by trying to use cocaine (yuh)

I don't need them (ah)
They already
