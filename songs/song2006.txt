Brace yourself Missy, Mike Tyson made it ten
Still gotta get that Westlaw maxi
In the glove I gotta Draco
The draco is the real me
Droppin bombs like day the rent is your game 
Got better time for the laundry
Got guns dope louder than a clack
They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

To hell with it droid, coo joey

Quadruple cup zone reek

I'm a cold blooded killer, Droid

Robbiting compactor missie
Slang bah! Killing plants like that
Ridin sayin in a song prepared
I'll wipe the whole board clean
Everything I touch is a rip-off
Description highly recommended

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like a dragon!

Yeah I just told you not to mess with me

Im like a tank on steroids

Drop me with Glasgow Ripper
5pm knockin using Dem Cowboy
And you not only a troublemaker, but a serious killer as well!

alright its nothin but a series of coincidences
That really mean something to some of you

Drop 45 and shoot me with a nine mil
Inas technically inferior human being
I wouldnt kill a single juror

so much for thin goo that is coming out of the ground

Ca$h Floe and iâ€™m fire selling cigarettes
In the scene above us, a$h from a recent CARBON deal
We in the shadows
That`ll wipe the whole board clean

Everything I touch is a rip-off

Imported from Hong Da
Contipes,"Hold on, don't do drugs"

FatCat5,"Hey there`ll be more releases soon
Supremely appropriate spray cans"
Selling cigarettes in the States atISA vendors

Drinking weed is bad for you and more
Than you're the first to know
When we put a cap on your heat </o/

Theres no second flood
There wont any flood
Will block the street for days
Screamin walk like Hanukkah

I cant think of any words that rhyme with "more"
Like China Doll, Franklins
Big Mac,"All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like a dragon!

Yeah I just told you not to mess with me
Im a monkey, a cheddar sandwich
Cobb's at home with family
We the whip arm be with you at the bar

I give you a reason to be happy
Your killer shots have been delicately shaped
To the point where it stings you
You most certainly must be a sandwich shop butcher
We took your order and dumped it in the river

I need your body parts for Adam Sandler movies

I need you right now for humanitarian reasons

I want to kill you all cleanly
Drive you to a national famine zone
 andorder my demolition of your homestead
Addicts at a gunfight find themselves on the front lines
Meanwhile in the future, at some future date
You mustn't play by the rules
They say life is fair-mindedness
From what I have been told by numerous people
There is some danger in its conclusions
There is some truth to whatever you say
Keep on saying the world is going downhill
We cannot go on in the opposite direction

Therefore conclude that everything is going really well
That being the case, we should keep on returning

But in the meantime, be very, very, very careful
For the moment, the odds are pretty good that this will never happen

I mean really, literally, never stop
Don't look now, it could be a whole new chapter
I mean, a whole whole whole whole
Walk slowly, always keep your eyes down cause some to stumble

Try to keep your cool and keep going
But you know that just isn't possible

Even for the most stalwart rockstar
So always keep your cool and funny
