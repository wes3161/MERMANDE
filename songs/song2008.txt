What do you call yourself now that you're a straight talker?
Busting ahead ever so slightly
Looking for cause behind another interracial couple
There no such thing as glorious cause
While countless interracial couples have passed
Matter of fact matter is a greater than c'mon
Due to the fact that we as a people exist
We as a people live in contradiction

maturing some of the lower echelons
Success comes in the form of been to numerous awards
Be it comedy albums, music videos, commercials
I highly encourage you cause im
