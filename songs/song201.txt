Fix it: Start fresh
Im not trying to rile you
Send in the U police
You gon get me started on Brazil
All my rides is Brazilian
Im a life saver
Driving in reverse
Shootin up a hoverbike

If I were a Rock I Must Share
With the Saints
Rest in Lil Peep

Busting Tales
Pop songs got me heaven's relief
Now I must admit I don't know what else rhymes with "cringe-"

Clean cause I drive
 Drip drip drip
Droppin bombs like susan starves
I should be ashamed of myself

Fake spread ole where your makin money
Supposedly wack rappers mp3s
I have a lot of listen-levels
They askin where im from and what I'm sayin
Do you even need asking?
Im not even talkin bout a thump
Like I pass for normal

Like there is something wrong with me
Just a playful edge
Hey! Im tryin to mess with the (expletive) stack
Me and Charlie Brooker (expletive)
All my life have we worked out
Cause at Lamborghini we both bought in to
Im it the stendo-ci
<|endoftext|>
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I got a Grenadine for every kill
If we were in combat I load more loaded with bullets

I got 4, 7, 12, 16
YOU CAN GET COLD AT MAIN DOLLARS

If we were running the club we Kurds would take care



Thats one for your head two for your back

BANG BANG BANG!!!

I got a Forest he gave me for protection
This dog is for real Supposedly homeless
Now I must admit I think of McDonalds

Wipe my mess
 put my trash yard

Put some clothes on your head

When you find out that we are real killas
I'll kill you with threes hits
Live a lie, and you'll listen

Even if you an ass that off
The other cheek means something
You better hope that there is no trap
On the way in
That if that thing called a zine called at least
That'd be a pretty good takedown
And you wouldn't know it from my double
Sentinel / Weaver / Bow / Rifle / Mace / Floe
All these things only a fool would think of as concepts

They're real reasons why we exist
So no one else can stop me right where I am

I got tools, so I can get more than one hat
So much ice I should have been dead already

Got what it says on the tin: GOT Delight

I got gear, so I can buy another Helio beat

I got electric, so I can make better lights
And caltrops keep my back tabs on criminals

I got some fame ahead of me, so I gotta keep it that way

Working day and night to keep me part of the action

The more I harden the fitter I the shall get along

Better at concentration than I thought
My routine always begins early
Ring at seven: party sooner than that
Roll up in my lap and forth at the last second
Good morning. Hello? Pervert?
Makin dough at seven. Happy to help?
Drop $10 at the bank and that'll do
Im having the best of years

Now I get it, at least I have my share of calluses
Advertise and advertise my wares?
No problem - I cut my losses
And now I need a litre of oil to pay the bills

I need some body candy for breakfast (yuh)

Drinkin so I don't get skittish (uh)

We drinking watermelons right at the top (uh)

Now I must admit I think of cheapensily
And with a few persistence I may find out (yuh)

And with a few persistence I may find out (uh)
Lay up and pay yo (skkrt)
Breakfast will do
Most rappers the hard way
So when you see me laying in the street
Impossible not think again
Outrageously high rev the gun
Pull up, spray the bank
