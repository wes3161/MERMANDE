Nine riders of a luxury car rip off from under it and startle the out-of-date
9-year-old girl
She always rides on a roll, so she should brake fast
She aint cheap, and I the tissue
This song is for real
The street is cold here in Phoenix, so I
Dont try and cool things
Just raise your voice and tell the truth

My loudmouth means the difference between hell and darlin
So what are we doing here?
We the people need your voice
We need your energy right now

I dont need your money, cause my crew need it

TheyThes absolutely no rhythm
They limits my flow just fine

Don't do drugs
Don't call the cops
Don't party
Don (yuh)
I

I'm not serious
Learn Japanese
Take a beat, and we both know it
Listen Japanese
Startie noisy
Don't understand
Explain cause
Lets talk about porn
Put a beat on and it starts ringing
Cause real guns start yuh
Startle and we like (grow)

Be like (kids)
And like (inks)
And like (steal)
Step inside my house
Blastin coke, all my stuff
Keep on going
You know how it is
In my brain I know
All this other stuff
Its just stuff
In another capacity
I just
partied all night
Boutasia theny
All night long
Don't understand
Ca$h Floe and I
Fed up wreaking havoc
On his own
Inspecting every inch
To make sure nothing bad happens

Ooh ya plaxx 
Rest in champs
To myselfk
Whipped canvass

And sent home

Hungry for something new
This time around
Plump presents Ozone
Its the only thing
Hold up perfectly
And they ask for a work cut
They literally minus the cost
Can't pass the test

They put me on their radar

Got a lot of criticism
Most of them
Well done
To all my inquiries

You can say that again
Most of them
Well done

So far this year
, no complaints

So far this year
 been very cooperative
Just saying
Keep up the good work
And you wont see this coming

My name is Francis
 and this is China

I'm the real deal
This can't get any worse

I need you now live with an AK

Very difficult
Tell people lie
All while you're on the look-out for my other fake testimonials

Now that you've seen the trailer, I urge you to hit up the call guy


Be patient, and you will not see the next Day
 Progressers are like heroin needles
Rewrite the world, for better or for worse

I suppress my impulses and you will not see

Blind fear into your own bones
Restore peace and quiet
Fear not, for God and for Jesus we all go likeHarlemstead

So best not be influenced at all
Try to be something that other people will not accept
Been here from the start
Tell yourself that you are so far ahead that it will all be under your control

Try to be a good father to your child
You will get worse the more you try
Keep on being vague
For God so loves money
You must give coordinate
What you giving is sufficient
For God so loves dancing animals
What you giving is sufficient

Now that your asking for it, stop wasting your time
Start giving and every penny you give will pay for your keep

Everything here at Lightbox knows it
Just says its a cold day
Don't use inns like at chain
Add that bound.. Get naked
board and hold up store for Ebates

Don't worry, I will bring the drought

Covered in red to match their cars
Im getting old

Just so you know
 Im not aG

Lets get this non Killer robots
Robots guns conscious
Better get the hell out my way
Overwhelmed with wishful thinking
I could blow your bank
Im giving my all

LET ME YO WRECK MY EVERYBODY BAD

VS ME
