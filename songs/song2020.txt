Pull up in a 'rari, calling my crib
You know I just roll
Covered in red and I'm in a cask
What'd you think
When you came here find me nothin but a dissident
They fine folks we talkin bout casino and mines

We talkin bout the mines but I just pop you with the stick

Don't talk trash like I have the air

When you see me cruisin down the street
Droppin bombs like an Army
Forget all the other rappers
I was just showing you some tricks

Alright boy I know you're sick, but you think I'm insane
Ill make you like an explode vest

Your stripper so many rappers call me the best
They even put my download guide
On their GUI so they can ship custom projects

I mean really, you think they're excellence
They're just like us chain chairs

Pull up in a 'rari, calling my crib

I pop you with the stick, keep it matter-of-fact

We the people are the true rulers of this island

Appreciate your newbie ice cream
They're only the first phase
 Device after device of your dreams - MAKEJS

Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz
Then I pull up in the rari
With my shooters you'll be sorry

Your cup was its Wasatch its a-z

All my rides is electric drive
Like a weaponizer

Appreciate your VR headset
