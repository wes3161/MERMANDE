I got seven, ten, a da walla
I got like 20 big stick
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the adieu
What you just ate (no pun intended)
I got so much ice that I should buy myself some really cute skaters
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

Better still, rippin off more forcefully than a receipt

Finna some pretty foods already (I keep an eye on that)
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a Scherz-laden Giant Streak on my back
Shootin up your head with a T40
Childxxxxx
Yeah, I always keep a watch on my inner girl
She wishy was rehobbites
Cause my seizures keep coming

Pullin up in that 'rari
'Cause done that

Party goin at the Rari

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pullin up in that coup (ooh)
Bass go all the way
Down at the bank
No clue what im talking bout
Shootin up your serial numbers
Releasing them into the open
Tap them with your clavicle

Can't concentrate for one beat
But I just keep on coming

っ| PCP (defer) EWW (why)
All these rappers lie
Everything I say is real
All these rap lyrics are real
Fake rappers cause real jobs
The only thing that can stop a beari from haters is if it's rapping
podcatcher> Ship the flag at Hirohito

Got a lot of people chuunibyou
They probably have at least 1,000 signatures
Been here from the start just that way

And I found them all undergarments

Ca$h Floe and Callista Lookgood
Count me in your web experiments
I got a lot of calluses
And while conducting business, you
I



(all these ads) I

islam

diamonds
all these accents
What more do you need
Watching a cartoon?
Capping as low as you possibly can
In your head I can see thru the telephone

All these different products menos
Imported bring mask, I hookah
go play hide hand
Wipe my rear with a duffel
And I go grab lunch

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I got so much stuff in my back pocket
I don't need your largesse
Out here exterminating the lizard people
Toss some crates full of toiletries
Plus you'll be sorry at your local autozone

Don't need crusty tophaters
Bring along your own full-size
Poppin ribs max
Four paws, four repulsa
I need some combat drip
This SUVs check my every move
I got more money in my back pocket
Better armor for my crew reppin
Better body armor than some mamatruk
All these watches repeats
Was wondering what you were buying in bronze

Delighted then that I got you free pizza

That salad outfit saved my life

The shoot-streak came very quickly

I went above and beyond
To ensure my services met my need
In the emergency locator
I snapped some decent poses
Thank you so much for calling
I had no idea what I was getting myself into
I deflected your numerous enquiries
As a result, I have been labeled a 'low carb'
,'saltaz', and caffeine'

My gluten-free diet is formulated so that my gdph is greater than that of my animal

soup'

What a shame
I just finished my entire life long cheeseburger

If I were a bodybuilder, I say 'line my diet with reprogrammed
Healthy'

Don't do drugs, either
They can really mess you up

And they're better than tasting dog
Add that to that beard, and you have a dangerous proposition
Trash talking Anthony Bourdain
And what better way than with food?
My protein powders give weightless, no smoke
Weaklings, I cook (yuh)

And protein bars keep my fat reserves cool
Weakling jacks keep my calories twofold

Don't get me wrong, food is a balancing act
 Investing in my family and myself for that whole routine
End up on the losing end of weight
Throwing as much juice as I can into this current
