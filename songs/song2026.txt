Im out in the street smoking a blunt
Hey there kids
Don't need no-no
Just hit 'em with as many bags as you can cram inside your car
Can't be more mistaken
Father of four, sick, dog, cat, knows it, habit (yea)
Three NBA bars of milk (yuh)
My whip only costs me so much cash
Some guy in a Toyota Hilux came to me
And told me they could get you perpetually cheap
So when they see you driving  they'll put them down

They calling the shots? Huh?
See? Im Parabellum
REHBILITATE!
 FREE TRILLBOUT!
 Earth-shattering total AR, meaning its worth it
Bookended only a very short time
Comrades to EIGHT MONTHS OF EXPLOSION

Lyrics top ten
10. Let it rip


Don't worry bouta bowl I gonna fill the World


Growing up my grit was dictated almost entirely to the creation
Of limitless wealth
And the one true God


Now that I wake up industrial immeasurably
Large Corporations are upon us
To take out the weak and the noncontigent
They can think big and clear
My numerous bankruptcies isn't exposing me to many

Backed by private equity firms to buy my new home

I am so booming right now that I almost
BANG A CRANK

40 MINUTES LATER
BEIJING CAN GET YOU ALONE
OH MY GOD
I CAN GET ABBA MOVING

Makin dough, makin dough
 Spread making meth, makin dough

Got 5, each day of the week

Ring philly dima pole
Hang in there just the way you like
When in need of drug reinforcement
Ild my gibility at its finest
I'll bring the scarf at the top

Don't do drugs (uh) but to themselves (Yuh)
 Confidently I'll prove to you otherwise
Led by my nootropic (uh)
That keeps me up at night
Shootin up yo visions
When I'm Melancholia-in-the-mouth (skkrt)
Shootin up yo dreams
You can see my ample belly
Brings me so much wealth (yuh)

I cant pass sobriety

To myself we would be naïve

Confident that I'll bring prosperity to all of us
Until we stop believing in ourselves
That neverhappens

When I take rides on government contracts
My spending more money than taking a taxi
Better get the hell out my way
In the glove I need with my every need
I'm a stress fracture specialist so
I must fulfill some highly nebulous
 Anything less than mystical dominance

My tyrannical conduct ends up garnering unwanted favor

As a result, I seek to outsmart and outproduce
My adversaries with measured, calculated responses

While accumulating more money I began to see the potential
To the extent that I can demonstrate my worth to some passionate
Asians I may well even be a god

With which to myself many teachings can be derived

While trying to piece together a puzzle greater than myself

I find myself desperately searching for what it is I aspire to

Therefore, despite my efforts, I still lack the strength
To beat my rivals without endangering my own

Traditionally, I have relied on my inherent prowess in all things weaponry
To accomplish my ends effectively, I must consistently strive

My numerous arcane and alchemical leanings have allowed me to produce numerous
Advanced Equipment Sets

As well as numerous temporary jobs, I maintained a highly technological society

I was the first to realize that every step of the way
I must keep myself on top
Therefore, I have a habit of purchasing more expensive automobiles

Successfully increasing my wealth results in greater personal freedom

While at the same time producing greater quantities of heroin, cocaine
Increasing my notoriety and wealth provides greater financial security

While taking illegal drugs such as crack results in poorer mental and physical wellbeing
As a result, I begin to see opportunities that I long for
Therefore, I am an expansive individual: I am no anacondava

Finicky? Consider this an alternative to alcohol: long-term potentiation
What would you do if you hadto choose between a life of relative tranquility anda bleak existence?

IÂm pleased to provide you withone of mylethritcs, a unique blend . Keep reading

Your senses have spiced things up
