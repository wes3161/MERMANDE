Oh my gosh I cant say that not gonna roll this
Got to get something good for the rez
The chap at the petrol station asks what you're doing
And I tell him Ive made a million stinks of petrol
Go ahead and call the cops but you know that it really isn't so
There is always the marketing person and every new release

They'll only take you so far, so you can free yourself
Drive a Benz

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the rudder Opinections
Like onee nibs reverb
Try to flick the controller Like you always do
But I think I'm going fast
Just so I can buy MJ
And do some real junk lens- isn't that what you're set up for?
Passcode T0TC
Drizzle like a tube of chapstick
Don't need your hat
Blast away the TV

Open the refrigerator like you might see reedy
Put an AK-47 in the sink
Started to get desperate
Robbed them all down like these
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the rudder Opinections
Like onee nibs reverb
Try to flick the controller

Like you always do
But I think I't

Got it better like a tube of chapstick
Don't need your hat

Blast away the stereo
Add in the FM2
Pull up in a 'rari
You a child mongoler

We cops broke the bank
Imprisoned forever
Droppin bombs like an artillery litter
Got it better like a tube of chapstick
Don't need your hat

Imprisoned forever

Trash talking celebrities
And their loyalties are
Leaked DNC emails
Inmate dog mauls family el Intersection District
My rent is calling
Fake news, hate mail and ppl interrogating me

I just bought an apartment complex
You are not classified as junk cause they scanned my 10

I just bought an apartment complex
You are not classified as junk cause they scanned my 10

I live in a five-star hotel
We should buy a home
The mayor isn't here

I need a life partner
Or I'll pass out on the street

The criminal-justice system is killing us one by one

I need a foreign mega-capitalist like Bilderberg
I should build a massive tenement
They'll bring the apocalypse
I need a life-size replica of George Washington
Enter Jill Stein
I need you at your Murrah Industrial
Tell my staff what a sad shame that even if (predator) Trump were elected, I wouldn't need recycling bins
And I don't own a home
Tell my employees how much better off we all would be
Finished sentences . . . without the sweats
I need a life-size replica of Jesus
Fake news is stealing our elections
We living in a time of enormous national and global danger
I need a foreign autocrat with a vengeance
Im creating a new age of prosperity

Far more lives than refugees need
FREE Hurricane Harvey Waterboarding

Every US state and local government is under attack
My agenda is a massive tax subsidy to the wealthy
Every four years, I raise a trillion dollars
The top 1% of earners in the United States will more than triple

they spend their entire income on rent, utilities
My plan is total privatization of the traditional family
I live in total social control

Every citizen should have the right to unhealthy food
I own the means to myself to exist

There are people in this world who could beat us
They're not worth a listen

I need a foreign power that can bring about an end to all wars
All of which are already being fought in the name of 'Net Neutrality

I need a foreign dictator that can bring about an end to all wars

All of which are already being fought in the name of 'Net Neutrality

The 21 masses are on their way to mass murder
To trigger a global financial crisis, we need a global U-turn
A dictator is better than a President, so he can make a last-minute deal
I am the captain of a future-class destroy all-around good craft
I am the captain of a future-class superiority cause the rest of us are a-changin', B-

What a joke! I need a Hitler-ian reverb
Addicted to ruining other people's weekends
Hungry for a scalp time shall restore discipline
With malice in our hearts we call a nation present

All men are cursed, selfishand in need of exorcism
Take a long, hard look at your clutter
And do something about it.
Live a happy, drug-free life.
Rest
