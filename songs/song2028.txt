Callin line o=(uint256)print(_( "Hey there brother. "); talking to himself in the lane

Answer my numerous cover letters
Wasn't intended for publication
Artistic very lute
Really bad spelling
What would a 1939 CARS look like?
If only I could finally understand
The art form
Before I could realize that changing the name of this game still stings

Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash

Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They askin where im from and what im talking bout

Got the stendo clip and I aint never play around

Better watch what you say fore I snap
Got a new prison cell coming my way

I need you back home goody
Bust a cap inside a buckwheat

Break into a meat market
Take a beat and steal a dollah
Bust like a George Lopez dollah
Quadruple cup secret your crush
Give em a pop and it'll get you out the door

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo stick
