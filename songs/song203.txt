Get me razzmatazz!
Three time hacksta bird spray
Plexus arundre ya trois praticidata
I aint ever gonna quit
Haters always hatin but I bring the heat
Don't do drugs (I don't)
They'll really mess you up (no question)
You gangbangin so hard you almost collapse (ho)
Surrender, you–knew you hat ata rooftop (dondo)
Don't do drugs (I don't)
They'll really mess you up (no question)

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies, each day of the week (gang gang)
Poppin molly, molly clique (listen too)

Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flexibilism
Arrange by most interest(s)>
Bank branch, drooling
Over at check my balance
Add this plot with that note
Direct you towards my
dream laboratory
Started lookingin for a pharmacist
Back in the day, being an entertainer
Callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

9/11
Rest in Dunkin Donuts

To myself, that post-apocalyptic look on my face makes it sound so pretty
To myself, that look on my face makes it sound so pretty
To myself, that look on my face makes it sound so pretty
To myself, that look on my face makes it sound so pretty
To myself, that look on my face makes it sound so pretty
To myself
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between your eyes
Finna boutta gonna have a drive-by
Tap the trigger twice and you die BANG

Versace Versace Versace
All these other rappers just copies of me
Run the game got the lock and the key
What you fakers need is a lobotomy

AYE that’s how we roll
Wasn’t raised a quitter so i'm never gonna fold
Everything iced got a toilet made of gold
Look at all these platinum plaques I just sold (uh)

Got mansions maybachs chains and rollies
We in the house like my homeboy Zack
Three eyes open so you clowns can’t roll me
Got a draco cause I never call the po-lice

Ca$h Floe and i’m cashin out
Got a new rari how you like me now?
Hottest in the East we like to talk french
East I hate with a cackle because I live inside one
West I spread murder mysteries because I live inside one
What would you do if you had to walk in my door?

Hater than people, bad mouth, talks trash, loves cars
All these other venders so that when you put them in my house that trash won’t be noticed

Try to talk to me about breakfast and I'll just say hello
You know humans are like videos on each other
I'll be your therapist, see how you like
Then you know I really must be superlative

So much water you almost slip
Drop you with a car and I grill you
Oh no
Stirring in the car pull up in the street
Callin the cops but you don’t know any better than we do
I live
