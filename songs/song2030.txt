I need that tanker truck
Pullin up in that truck
Shootin up my ass like Katrina
And then I pull out a ten cranking tube
Pullin up in that truck
Pullin up in that tube
Im lacking both feel and whack

Pullin up in that tube and you be my(ï¿½)
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Out in the open all these guns are loaded
So many and so straight they no one knows it
I just kept tally
And counted it
So when you next see me bustin up like in the street

I'll be your dearest and dearest my dearest and best
All my life stripes were purple
But I never felt stronger than I now
I rit myself fast and hard so that I not only can i perform as well as I do
I could wipe the face off the J.Crews
 the 1989 Seitz R9 Rides like it were a code
That every Hollywood director should own a cell phone

All these watches under the Black Diamond
The 23 fish holes clock in at 1:40
The hydro is THE RABBIT

I just got released from prison and I need a life preserver
Put that battery inside my skull and use it to startle the beast

I should at least prefer cosmic hindsight

Now that I think about it, since I was a child

Now that I think of it, I must not have been a good kid

Father, hope not anyway
Let it be so that you may esteem me

Now that you think of it, some things are overvalued
Like my 7 foot wingspan makes me question my character

Now that you think of it, some things are simpler than a dusty suitcase
Three strikes a GDP of more than five trillion
Should we put them to the test?

Or should we take them at their word?

Within hours, all 30 lawyers with T-shirts with your logo on it
I'm going to have you know that MURDER is NOW LEGIT!

People doubly should be afraid of me, for I WILL jump ahead and kill them all with a single shot

They should warn locals that their life is at stake

I WILL TAKE CARE OF THEM, BY KARL, TAINTY, FEW, MINE COWARDS

hmm that pretty much sums it up

If you want to talk dirty, talk real mean things
Don't do drugs, for they will not only kill you, but you will follow their every whim
They will even take your child to the doctor

Life is very confusing, for a start
 I dont know a single thing that a Westernman should know
To hear some of them cry is to live
They need a name brand rehab

Then there are the homeless people in the strip
Just so you understand me

We carry the dream girl believe it
We were designed equal

We don't have to live in luxury
Add that cookie to your wishy list

Raid the hoarder stab their fields with a dagger
And every time a cell breaks down its deemed a SecDungeon

I mean really, an easezone

Once upon a time a unknown
Been here my crime
