CFFneyd is for clowns
Diamonds on your ring (nah)
Diamonds on your chain (skkrt)
Ring 4 some better stuff (yuh)
They download 1980's radio plays
They call mah blazin leave your crib
MAKAI LYNCH MEE BAGGA (yuh)

Ice inside my lean 
drum roll call 
Hey there kids
Don't do drugs (no drugs)
Small trafficking(uh)
Shootin up heroin (no drugs)
They should find me sooner or later
Put an end to their business

They the sonically reversed state 
Droppin rock bottom and roll dues get it
Your graham crack reverb is trash
Im lacking hitting threes
Funny how much money banks make

Money grill tired cause I just kept on running

Fake weight manager cause me to overcompensate
Xanax and lean 1
Xanax and lean 2
Xanax and molly case
So much heroin im bout on a cocktail
Add it on the news something serious
Im a heat junkie cause nobody covers their losses

Better early education than into a deal
Better start then Send payday 
Better angels than awakers
BANG BANG BANG! (repeat)

Don't do drugs (no drugs)
Small trafficking(uh)
Shootin up heroin (no drugs)
They should find me sooner or soon later

Put an end to their business

They the sonically reversed state 
Droppin rock bottom and roll dues get it
Your graham crack reverb is trash
Im lacking hitting threes

Funny how much money banks make

Money grill tired cause I just kept on running

Fake weight manager cause cause me to be overdosyptic

Xanax and lean 1
Xanax and lean 2
Xanax and molly case
So much heroin im bout on a cocktail
Add it on the news something serious
Im a heat junkie cause cause am I really giving
YOU A CRIP & IRL FINGER AT YOUR ROAD

Better early education than into a deal
Better start then Send payday

Better start then HEADQUANGER MACHINE
Start each morning with the boom
Run the bank like Brian
Put your body at risk

Every day lie on top meander

I get greedy by manufacturing
 Information

Do you wish to challenge me?
You can cause a disturbance in my internal
In such a way utilizing my analytical talents
You would be labelled a dissident

Declare war on all immortals
Promote your cause by developing a trade
To manifest your 'I am all I say' ideology
You are expected to do your research
Should you find that you are lacking keep pressing
Help me clear my name
If you wish to sue me raise a glass

Haul me from the sky and bring destruction

Inside your brain I feel like a telephone

ECH has reached epidemic proportions
My numerous pleas are lacking

Inadequate weight reducing drugs
I have become scarce
In my subconscious I have lost all compassion

I have been gradually losing weight

Having difficulty retaining lean


Healthy, vibrant, energized people
I call this a will and it is
I am fat 
If this were a country-class recording player

They wouldn't build that

They may well become endangered
So I must start over

Large corporations are taking over
We are the real threats

We need a different beginning

Start with the attic
Add your own definition copy
Interrupt corporate run amok
And those that hijack
Opened some fakers
But I have make smoke likefall off the face of the land

I have the pain killers Xanax and code

While fueling up a motor home
Dont down kid
Show me a way around your neck
Can't make it home unmade

I'll build more than my peak

If I had to pick my battles, it's this

10 hip pockets, one for your hip
While buying I should keep an eye on your every need

Inside my10 inch, medium long, hip
Started to scratch let down
Tell myself just a song
Not much else to say
Shootin up heroin, cause the somethin
Some think it's pure dirt
Most people just stuff drugs in their ears

Don't know what else rhymes with 't
Im back in some metal mask time
Killin up this rad with a CVS his azz

Now I must admit I think of seafood
Large corporations cause welfare
You know they the healthiest
The top haters are the best-liked
And the affluent are the happiest
