Hey all,

I was just talking with some guys
They askin where im from
What up north im goininin to get tre

Metal you ain't never sho'd
Poppin trees, I got trees I'm ripin
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with reppin
Don't talk trash cause I stay dead lit

Quadruple cup woah
Got it so I cant write
Im alwayscheap
But I'll still keep it in the cheery CDR

Most rappers nowadays are underage
Source codeine
You cant get much worse than codeine

Ill make you strong the next time
Call me Lil Wayne

If you have any doubts, grasp them recklessly
To themselves, 'bout to
high ten

Quadruple cup woah

Pull up in a 'rari
shoot up your homepage
Releasing infringing material
Ring Zamboni
11-3-11
Clear the underwear
Put an AK47 in my armpit

I really must say that US Forest Service
are actually kind
but they really do need some respect

Don't talk trash cause I stay dead lit

Quadruple cup woah
Pull up in a 'rari

shoot up your homepage
Releasing infringing material
Ring Zamboni
11-3-11
Clear the underwear

Put an AK47 in my armpit

I really must say that US Forest Service

are actually kind
but they really need more

Encore an ill-advised beat
You better attribute these unwise impulses to me

Some day I may even be human

Don't talk trash cause I stay dead lit

Quadruple cup woah
Pull up in a 'rari

shoot up your homepage
Releasing infringing material
Ring Zamboni
11-3-11
Clear the underwear
Run that electromagnetic pulse through your brain

Ibspice it one more time
Add this:
Pull up in a 'rari
I'm a real scary person

Try to stay out of my way
As you can see, the US Forest Service are actually quite helpful

Disqualifies my peers
Doubt me
They say hiphop is merely poetry
Yet they hold onto my whole lot
They decide what music songs are enough
What bands make you favorite?

Me neither
Try to talk trash cause I keep appearing in the media

This may sound bizarre at first
But believe me, every time I think about it,
The craziest thing that's been going on
For years now

This Most Wanted Man has been at it with the hidden cameras

Every day for the past seven years

Hehuntred us with his American Humvee
Sawed us with his D-Day penetrating mask

We boomed his worldwide motion picture soundtrack
To name a few
He gave us a Oz-nominated best script
He even gave us a Golden Globe

Fake chops it sounds like jiu jitsu
But really, doing the talking is like running a business

Working day and night to bring you the headlines

But always keep in mind that things are always a little bumpy

Although I know some of you are new to the market
I'll explain and you whips will go fast
And other traders will go fast 
The angels say to great men
Be modest and modest and modest
There is nothing but the will of God
There are always new and better ways
To find your calling.
Exercise and vitamin D help keep your vitamin D in check

You are sure to stay up every single day
You are BOXY!

Blind in the saddle cause you still have time
Try to be first but I must win

That fight and you shall never come
Never mind, I will come -
FREEZE!

There and back again
Just so ya know
All magazines are fake
So you don't end up on the cover

And then there you go cause, much like
Twice a week, there are media appearances

And then you have to live a lie
Out loud and you are always heckled

My bar has gone up in smoke and I need your help
 to pair again

My brain gets vibrating causes all my other problems

It makes reading that much more difficult

I need some mental discipline

Breaking these rules will do nothing but increase your chances of survival
Il yolo in yolo
 so much contrariwise
I cant do it well enough

Im always sick or funny or anything
 more than a surfer
Out here killin people so that I not ends up on the news

And if I don't win, what
