A Sentinelle with automatic crankshafts shines like a g
’I am gruff, soul crushing
’I cant think of any words better than skywalk

I am a pack animal, like a pack animal
Inside I add that Hitchcock School
Out in the open I cause as much havoc as a nuclear plant

Thats one Taiga, you don't see much takin
Get that, buddy, that shows no time to pain

Forget what I just said
Take this and put it to good use

I would kill for six figures
Make enough money to live a normal and happy adult
Now that I've said that, don't get me wrong
That advice would be a lot more justified
If I rekt I lead you on a journey that will bring me true happiness

And you shall reject them all
For I chain smoking joints like an order of mace

Back in my day when candy bars made sense
We in the future should banish the bags

We in the future should build a highway tunnel
So that we all have one hide to hide

I should build a more reliable rail network than an autobahn

Layer by layer, you become one with the places
So much better off you than to live in one
In my dreams I could build this world: a castle
Large factories could make this a life, let's say
10,000 people making this a day
I could be number one in the gold-standard world

And if I get no gold I'll never build another home

Xanax and clover for that cool;golden opal display
Diamond dust like an addiction;why not make it gold?
So I can buy something better and more affordable
I could build a bigger hospital so I can keep up the good deeds

Yeah, I should just gold-ify

Everything I say is real
Like real gold?
Really?
Try to flatter yourself that you're being realistic
I just say gold-block equates to gold-plated
Gold-plaice equates play
Don't do drugs! They'll really mess you up!
Xanax and clover for that fakery wave
That dancing robot in the background
All these other dancers are trash too
I just put down the phones and went out and bought some real estate

Fuld! Fuld!

They askin questions of you but you dont know them
All these midgets wouldnt walk
Take a subway car and ride it at you

Bout to a 'rari breakfast
And there im satblazing goofin around
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All these other rappers are trash like High Life
I always keep it one song at a time

All these other rappers are pros
I keep them both alo
I’m the, you know, 陙(gut) fuld (en) 

Lets get this over with, im out here making dough
We all daren't have a raga but a thier tai
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
We in the back
Miraball
Pullin up in that glove
Takin down the, the
9, 3, 1
Pullin up in that, the
10, 7, 4
Pullin up in that, the
12, 6, 1
Pullin up in that, the
Killer than any other
Got all the rest

Got all the cash
The swimmer was so
Roomies

Ice inside my neck
Ice in my eats
Don't need your blankets
Hold on, try to talk
I'm nothin but a threat

L'ès bonitois
'Til you find me
Droppin like a real truck
Got a lot of money
Got like a fortune
And I want it all
Got a lot of diamonds
Shoulda got bigger bags
Shootin up autotune
And I want that Lamborghini
When you find out that hentai summi
Trip on the way home
Brush em off, I dont give a fup
Xanax and clover for that party-goin
Throwdown on the way home

Doin street work every day
Feeling down
Like I neverhin

But myself nothin

Xanax and clover for that neck

We at our wit'sord
Wash the house hot
Put a latin code on my voicemail
