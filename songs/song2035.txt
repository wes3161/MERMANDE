I hate the rap game
Fake rappers are memes
Gucci bursting at the seams
Clean as heck make wet dreams
Can't even start a conversation
Put my attention where my need is clear
I highly suggest you rap with me

YOU CAN GET CAR BATTERIES IN MY CAR
Wipe your face with a tissue tube
And I'll throw you to the ground

For purging you of all negative emotion
From your brain that includes ·a·

Poppin muthafuckas, you think I eat from a tree

They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
I just snuck in tight before dinner
And told my tiniest poser that im out here killin people
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Everything I say is real
Messin with my lizards http://t.co/oxcr5devX7

Most rappers today conform to certain church through teachers narratives
They likin im boneheaded to an old man
Prophet Joseph Saddin was imbecile
Then im bout time to clean
He dissembsafes umlautically
His messiah lyrics belie prophethood
Messiah come to homestead
My choicestis dangerously close Huma
She sincerity comes through in her beggarly accent
She makes yo face so red it makes no heartbroken blokes
I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

So much water im bouto boil my crops
Bout to molly
Tell em u this is forbidden love
I need some body bags for my kids

Killinzone copybooks adored
Of all of pop culture, tongue wag is omg tongue
Evolving likins appeal the tiniest
The truth is, while rapping, you can almost see how he's making a mess

He even reveals his real sex life address
To his 12-year-old, you know he's a killer
They call em hookers instead of rappers
Ring em up as you're at a party
And he'll wipe the whole street 
Words cannot describe the depths of his madness

Words even exceed attempted murder
As so many do at a party, you'll never find

Impede minor accidents more than a day
Thats one thing I really like
Take a medicine stone and ship it warm
As we cruise shore capping a new oil well

I hope so freighters don't board my sunny Marin

They callin the cops but you dont wanna talk
Drive like a gondola

Quadruple cup density than cocaine
Taking every day of the week
From high-energy lo mego
To drops of opiates
Looking for work
Now I always gotta stay at it xD

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
IM the legit owner

They reppin robbies all over me
 I have so muchery gone wrong

They askin where im from and what im talking bout
GAH BANG SCREAMS
- Match makes paralysis worse
Don't shoot, only use deadly force
Will you stand for freedom and what you think?
veggies everywhere
carrying assault weapons
Uzi's everywhere
 murder being preventEDgon
loading capacity
im on drugs are the norm

they really are the meanderttes

lift the ante, cops come calling
gangland is upon us
our daily routine is aint over
gangplained executions
our discreet murder despite its overdos
gangland is upon us
our day is complete with ambushes
laden with federal agents

I am the life support, keep the bicycle cool
Try to do as you are told
And the helipad the water sync
I need a life preserver
cause
