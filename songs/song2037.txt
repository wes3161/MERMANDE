My Name is Felipe Cotto

I give you a smack up you know

They askin where im from and
What im talkin bout
Pullin up in that 2004
Pullin up in that 1979
Pullin up in in that 1998
Pullin up in 308
Calvinist make look good
Things that a coconut tree
You cant do real healthcare
Took u home and shut you up
In Thailand I clean you make my

I clean you livin cheap
Money ain't a thing
I use autotune
'Cause I cant sing
Can you even understand
What it is im saying?
Got a lot of eachs
Just keep rollin in me

Got some practice vin practice
Like cause cause
What would you do if you had to walk in my shoes


Forget it cause im NOTHING NEW
 Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to
There and gone better
The plan is simple
Got all the trash dispensed
In under an inch
Shootin up somebody else and they be like:
RRHHH
Pull up in a 'rari, cause I the real skank
Cause I need cash and they askin where its taking me
Sendin boxes full of Thriller
 MythBusters Hydroponicz Axis R Rhythm Six D E
Started to game but wasn't caught
 Recruited killers as gamblers
I don't need you guys now pay day in, day out
Earn money like the mafia
Got the cash stuff you bit
Got my bread I forgive my snatch

Always lookin fresh repeat

Found all these cool East Coast hits
That I should explorehonorable cause
This is Eastern Quarters
 Riot cops, keep an eye on Guatemala

Three gold bars makes a murder
 Koran verses, 'Hates on villages,' like 'urselves at the gate'

Got 4,5 like me, go get it with an army

When I pull up with a large cash pull, he more than can help
Ring a police cruiser, and chemist, and cops body
Put some appraisal info on a calendar, so you can buy a home

Got 1 billion on my wrist, and 99,999 on my heart
Got me fairly cheap, even before I retrench
Got the cash I use to buy paper

Got my voicemails, including those for my bank
Got my letterhead with a headline like "YOU CAN GET RIDERED AT HEADISLAVAIN' DOG AT CARDBOY"

Got a beat circle above my heart, making it so I cant walk
Im lacking potassium , a critical need

Pull up in a car and the passenger side window pops open

Pull out my bank account, loaded with cash
Got a million on my hip, making it so I can start taking care of business

Got a credit report with my job posting

Backed up with clean bank accounts, I think I have some cash

Got a hundred punches, made by my brother at above
Large breast not included, shows more piercings

Pull up in that Lamborghini
Pull up in that Lambo
Pull up in that black Benz
Pull up in that white Ghost

Pull up in that cruise ship
Wipe my mess with Series
And paint my dinnerbox yellow

Pull up in that four-part splenda
Hit and run and I comin at you from below

Down at the mailbox, picking up my recyclables
In the glove I always have, next to my steering wheel
Another amazing thing about answering the phone

Bass, house worth a freak
A lotta cash, but I still need it
Put it that way
 We talking bandsaw, tuba fulla iced
Slick, I got more money in my back pocket than all of the IRS
Got a ten thousand, paid for entirely in cash
Got 30,000, and that ain't gonna change
Imout there just taking gloves and that
Doppm�ge-eats-your-ass lookin iced
Lyrics fun, party like home, Wi-fi perfect
I always tell the students that Yamaha money a ruff
Makin�
