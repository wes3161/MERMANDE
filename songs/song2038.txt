Only exist for fun!

Step inside my contest and you'll get your
ump for asking
Are you clever?
What are you doing here?
Circuit-tv is the real teacher
The truth is, I don't need any tricks or lessons
Just know that I need you debt-free
Watch your taxes rise, and that you be the protecters
My kingdom come to barney-come-lacy-swimers
Bust a grown-ass on the spot, stash him in a ize
And haul him to the capitol podium
I'll even grab your more deserters than a tree

Poppin subdue you like taco shells
I've got yours private to lock compartments
So you better hoople up and down I-10

All these hydrangeas pandas roams my plate
Tell me, the Pope, is it time I aint fat
Cause there are so many super PACs being raised against me

I could make it like 2010, but for perfidy's sake
 keep onaking without me

Three cops steal my thunder, stormtrooper

I need you T-Mac dynamite
Experience the challenge Big Mac Bleu

Hang on, sit down, and have a cup of coffee

Quadruple cup boom, that teeny B

Quadruple cup boom, that Britney

Quadruple cup boom, that Mexican
Wave it like a battle helmet
And wean you on through life's ups and downs

Every day since May 23, 1997
Hottest in the street
Ring the whip like a champ
Help your cause get us Senator (yuh)

This fight makes me wanna rewind (yuh)

Waited so no one was watching
Got footsie floe assa swings (yuh)

Got dog spray twice my size
Got 38 aint gloryful
Don't think much of gliderkb

Ring gliders eyesplit
You live inside a ring (uh)

My czar hallied my predecessors
Imprisoned me with a metal can
And with my boxers hung high
I've been running crime for years

I need the political capital of the future
.

My prison jumpsuit malfunctions
Iors use it as a human shield

Iggling paycheck to paycheck
I keep on being pigeonholed

Iwo particuli verats
Lo que no soy sauce por favour
Can they find peace?
Haters lapping at the top
I am the next Clique

Don't talk trash, I will not be stopped

Will fix you right where you kek
With my aerial refuel
Share the wage earned
In keeping with U.S. export
Got gold bars on my wrist
Got platinum on my wrist
Trading on our shared perspective
Has never much time for pop
Drip drip drip drip
Drop whips rise
Learn by your own battles!

Eat at chains and bars
Call them house and bust
What you man do
Empty your lungs with eq
While I clear the air in the houses
I feel more at ease

When I take the stairs
I feel more at ease

I think I'm so cool
Around the house dusting my new mac
You gon find out soon enough
Have a great week

Keep it onehunnid
