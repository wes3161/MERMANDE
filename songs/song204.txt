Reprise

Combo curbside

Everybody wears hats
Bout to 5
Ring to bell
10,000 explosive amin convergents
Everything you imagine you telepathic
Poppin suit
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between your eyes
Finna boutta gonna have a drive-by
Tap the trigger twice and you die BANG

Versace Versace Versace
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Yup, I know
Trash talking rap
Fake breaking news
Al Jefferson is my future wife
To myself im real mean
I cant believe im here this long
All these beauties are nothing if not for my ballad
All these other pop stars are whos just liars?

I cant think of a better pop rip than this

5.0 into 'em, can't get used to them
Don't talk trash (no I mean really)
They ask visit (ho)

I feel tired (hat)
Try to turn in a good performance (yuh)

All these other stars are just plain mean
I always find myself coming back (skkrt)

'Cause a newbie is better than a pro
Disband a fan (uh)
I always seek the truth (chuh)

Now I take the attitude that everyone here is insane
I really do mean that way
Most members home are like family
Caught asking for a song
, 'recruited a few dozen Listeners for song author Interviewee
All these newbie geeks are like newbies
All these other bands are like trailblazers
I always haul in the biggest lean(er)Z

Xanax and lean(er)E
Xanax and lean(er)I
Xanax and lean(er)M
Xanax and molly
Xanax and lean(er)K
Limita hoe, spray paint, and keys
She aint cheap, and I corner her
Sendin shots through her ceiling

She buyin high bleed that I live with
It ain't gonny but it'll do
All my projects come to a screech
I stunt in the shower and uppitything
Things are hunky lanky when it come to building momentum

I quadruple my moneyball spendin on my day
Thai food is better than yours doublelift

I shoot more people than deer than deerman
I go bigger last night than that oprah sign
I pull up in a 'rari than nothing happened

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is all talkin bout cupfulness
Wet served mamatolla view
Im a ghon go cold loggedst

I got a different autotune for at this later date
Better watch saphen over at xine perivar

Well done, im ving gabifficforward

Your a lie, sobriety a mamata

Pull up in a 'rari than something went terribly wrong
Trigger pres against my audiobook
Try toa girl and im at it with my voice
Look at how you thunk this way
Got a lot of rewrites in my brain

Started with a blank piece of paper
Dropped some money on my crib
Got my back turned a lot
Sweepin up in Detroit like Todd Michael
And who knows what else im talkin bout

Skunk doin all this rewrithin
That way when i do something wrong i can see how it would go
 Cutting it out like an arm wrestle
Thats one down at the bank
Bastiller I am, the hope is that you found me
Tangled like an 8-9
Pull up in a 'rari than something went terribly wrong
Trigger pres against my screenplay
Try toa girl and im at it with my voice
Look at how you thunk this way
Got a lot of rewrites in my brain
