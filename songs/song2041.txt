Haters hate here, we best stay inside Tesla coils
There for the taking,
The exits are always dripping with white
Most Tesla Model Ss I snapped in the D

Got orders out the front door
Shootin up bigger 'fore I even scratch
All my expenses go to pay myselfa mortgage

Pop pop, pop pop, steal up Ship them vats full of cash
I need a life preserver
Bout to do cashbunds

So much for small business
In my day firms and when I brought the mighty fold
I mean really, really, really, pretty big
Large Company, massive cashbund
Drinkin so much champaign, I cant buy ices
Large Better grow my supercoffee
I should grow my own coffee
Big Business big day, I coulda been a doctor
When Chinese Washington burned my brain
My dream come true
How could I live?

Clean myself

Imprisoned under a watchman rail
In there performing an identity-searche
Holding a squad acquisition trigger
Pullin up in a 'rari'
Menu with cheese and sangria
Treehugger making his living as a postal inspector

Heh heh, numerous scam artists murder my ex several times
I just bought a yacht so I can spend it somewhere else
So my net worth is estimated at more than $200 billion

I would strongly consider emigrating to the U.S.

Take a junior floe and drive her to bankruptcy

Father not my brother, violence is taking my shine

Give you cancer and sickness and down time

Always a blast at your knees

All these other rappers rapping about him
Don't talk trash cause I stay on my message
