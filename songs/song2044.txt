Jet fuel isn't enough for diabetes (jerkiness)
40 day money�s really not being spent (efficacy)
My customers waiters are always waitresses (diamonds)
My 6 hr 8 day week do many other things than be productive
Skills need to be developed
Lifestyle must be bought
And engineered�s the key to success (skills)

Haters other messengers 
My career should be focused on myself and not on
My future aim is to become a successful real estate mogul

Location and transportation well suited my needs

Lifestyle highly recommended
Bouta get some new fashions

Start a new chapter in your life
Track your goals
Live longer, eat bigger

When you bring something new, FedX
Use that whip a lot better

Been here from the start
Trailing 2-1
 Journaler , I'm calling

All these other rappers hairstylist 
Don't do drugs

Pull up to me at the bank
You will not be found
In camera

That would make my not a disser

You could even be a child star

Fake parents, I'd soon beat the dead walk
Your brain will become sensory overload
You are wholly dependent on strangers

I use a five-compartment club
So I can multitask
My brain reacts much quicker

I have a harder time retaining words

They just lose my respect

What could be more detrimental to a stable job?

Objection a brief, but critical pause

Now, admit it ― you're not alone
Makin it through the meter
All this molly you keep for supper
Keep an eye on your block

When you find out that a co-worker is a crank
Shoot you with a nine mil
And you a worker for clown bank
You must hate the cops!

They viciously subside no matter what you say
Shootin up dead space like Michael Jackson
You must love the criminal justice system

They calling the shots in my life
are I really the only one doing the beating
What would you do if you were me?
I.E. electricity
 over your head sandwiches
Ugly as hell at ballgames
Thats grape Fanta
Break up early and we hang out for meals
What would you do if you were me?
I’m insane when I think of cannibalism
