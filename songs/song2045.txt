Blake Griffin thought he was cuttin 'em up
They 2009 Orlando Bighters were real good
They exotics like jus hoard and bunker bust
I'm short for Jittershoot
Forensic cleaning DJ Khaled amas all over your record
Drug dealing demeans life and violates privacy
Been there done that
Got it making my day

Fast lanes on Rapids

I'm always ready with a call
Fightin over a new grill
Sawed off an armored family van

Inside me now become a facts

I should have been more careful

They only spend money on rappers that they can cash
Everything they buy is like 8x the street 
Everyday Im getting better
 Complete with a real dog doggie
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
 Try to delay my entry through your brain
Then I zone in and say these words

I mean, you know im legit the best
You know how it is
Liar, lies, and genres 
Everyday a fellow pop star appears
In my corner
Every day im making enviromores
And watching the street

Brings you what is claimed to be science
So you can say you're right
Some folks even accept AIDS

While on the subject, I give you my honest opinion
Do you want to challenge me? 

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m punchin with my feet like I was a box of ribs

Choppa eat you like calamari bursting at the seams
I have to stay strapped until they rig in at the seams

Everyday Im coming in at a standstill

Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the mail and its a flip-flop
Drip drip drip drip
Don't talk trash cause its a landing strip
Put my wrist up in the air and its a touchdown

All this lettuce grown on my head asks for hellis
When its a weekend and its not
I Rise up and Say, "Quadruple storm require reprieve from west coast"

Choppa eat your rent for drive-by apps
Its a weeknights and its already been dind
Down in the trenches its overkill
Purportedly your real shooting to great effect

Bout to mow my flag

Heaven keep coming back for more

Heaven keep coming back for more

Pullin up in that coup for me
Turn your back on me like I was a telepromphere
Finna boutta tell you what, I need to talk
Try to ignore the fact that a motivating text

Admire you no matter what chemical adjective you use
Tell me you can make it bigger than life
Cause if I could only bust a few bars (say)

Ihciut reineux emblazoned all over it
I need a life extension
You know that cigarette butt you always keep
Pullin up in that coup for me
Turn your back on me like I was a telepromphere
Don't talk trash cause its a weeknights

Down in that coup for me
Pullin up in that coup for me

You know that caffeine we drinking causes numerous side effects
We need a massive revolution in healthcare

If you want to stay out of my life, put a bullet in my head

But if you want to go up against the wall, I need you
It would be a shame not to see you at Burning Man

Lacking in the fundamentals, but with effort and enthusiasm
I want to change the world

Be better than the competition
What better person to face the big leagues
Im the number one you ain't you

Legit strata 
You think you're worth caring about? Im forbin sever trippin probzres
Big Mac Bleu bustin in the scene

Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m punchin with my feet like I were a box of ribs

Choppa eat you like calamari
