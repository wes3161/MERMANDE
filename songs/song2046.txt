Pull up in a 'rari, my privilege is viva Rampo
Easy HIV/AIDS, biotin, diphenhydramine running my spleen

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip

No shoelaces I don't trip

They scanned my address book
And counted my purchases

The number one single you hate
All these foreign words made fresh
Now I really need a life
Drug abuse put me at gunpoint

Decry tyrannical foreign governments

All my hard earned money is wasted traveling

Tocrate! Dismay!

I need a foreign name for my body

Fake legislator they say We the people
The good guys they frequently vote
Most peopleer full of junk
To myself I am a heroic leader
