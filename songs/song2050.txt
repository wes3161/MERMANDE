I need some sleep

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Hoard (skkrt)
Break ground (skkrt)

cause flys, pay extra

Fuld be leche jus
I need a ride home unannounced
The pub is under construction

I need a lift in the Parking Lot
 (ayy)

Ride on my 'rari
Chimp a beat (yuh)
I want to ruling the streets
Scout the rap scene
I need your help attorney
Help rap be more successful
 I found a technique for pulverizing joints
 A treble treble
Blind me with your frustrated lyrics

I need a lift in the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building

9/11 was no joke
—- Rapper Eminem hits back at critics
Outspoken lyrics are the new white boy

Lyrics are the new mic
Xanax and lean (uh)

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz
Then I pull up in the Ropes
With my hooks you'll be sorry

My armory, expansive
My catapult aint passive
Tha barret is be terrible
My flamethrowers be long
I’m subbing in for Doge Tatum
I'm nitpicking here
 High school irl
Dressed in printed shirts
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip
Robots in glove eel

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz
Then I pull up in the Ropes
With my hooks you'll be sorry

I’m subbing in for Doge Tatum
I’m subbing in for Doge Tatum
I’m subbing in for Doge Tatum

I’m subbisting on the lil snitch
Heck no more memes cause we shut the t-beat down
Shoot you with a stendo clip
4x as good as him
5, 6, 7
9, 10, 11
Karma coming from the heart
2, 3, 4
Kiss plaxy stuff gonna die (aye)
Don't know what else rhymes with shebang
Disqualifies Evil
5. 0-galaxies
Out there, doing good
Livin, buying, selling
7 yu pixelae
Trash talking tisty
9 pack stella
Mess with me much longer
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me much longer (uh)
Disqualifies Evil

Displeats, blathering
Blind me twice as much as I need
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Maybe I should put my amateur streak to use

Group thing
I really need some
Makin' dough
Shootin up ya mess
Making dough at an autozone

Taking a bite out of your
