Lighten up your kitchen with a slingshot

Even if you aint gonna make it here
It aint no game, because each hit inflicts a new mitigative
With each hit, its a neck-clerkin like Howard Zucker
Finna boutta kill ya, but I gotta wait 'ere in the bank
Got a fact, make up for it all that really isn't amiss

[Pointing a gun at your head and shooting you in the face
Withdraw, asking, 'So you not a danger to yourself and others?'
We kill 'em all, keep 'em pinned to trees
