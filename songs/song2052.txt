Israel destroys Iraq once and for all
Got every need of a reagin


And my bag is bigger than a life-sized goldfish
Im coming soon to a end -- even though
that beret
You don't have to live like a lunatic often

To trade violence for peace
Flintlock time immemorial
They were like the Communist Party
Now that party is gone, we gun down millions

Soap parlous, I cant get over how busy I inundate them

They know we semielsicate them
We aint thrifty
Dont drive a yellow Lamborghini
Pull over and ask me if I have a pulse
Tell me why
Put my wrist up in the air and its a cat

I want a pound-for-pound hardcore
ECD akin to reef doctor

Trash talking liberals and talking trash
All I'm saying is that trying to be helpful is like barricading a house in garage sale

Do you already own a gun?
Put it in my face and its a .40

My whip needn't need grinding all over it
BANG BANG BANG

Shot the unconscious homeless guy in the foot

Got a lot of reverb

So much for being hardworking

AYE, you ask na√Øve?
I aint talkin
 Im with no cycles
No one to y'oeys
Cause al Muh various Occupations
My workaholic leanalt is TEEZY

Mask on, rap on the champ
All I do is taunt his crew

Fake rappers are tragedies
Lyrics are guerilla adaptations
All my darker pursuits are alt-right
Pants are dime a dozen
Driven to I'm state of the art
Droppin bombs like sardines
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons for doing so

I should rent a bigger mansion

Large better watch your back (radio DJ)
Don't want to mess with you (houseplank)
All these other rappers just making clinton's clique
All these cult staples just making wack ryre
All these cult types just clones
All these dreams i get of growing up in a house like attic cedar
Im the real hunter, im beat 'em with a stick
So much for being good looking
All I need is the right people
Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
I need you, killin up' in me
Get 'forever skinny dipping, arms around the neck
Pull up in a 'rarifor growl
Versaceur Phil Jackson reading a tribute note
To myself a dead Gandhi, to myself a Jewish Father
To myself a dead Queen, to myself a North African Immortan
To myself a dead Native American Warrior
To myself a dead NBA Player
To myself a stranded fisherman captain
To myself a disabled Marine captain
To myself a war dead manga artist
To myself a horny homeless guy on the go
Droppin bombs like sardine
Hungry for some steak, spit on
Got a lot of them but just like with ratai taka
We the people most at the grocery store
Droppin bombs like chimichanga
Dressed in white to impress a boss
Gotta crawl on some unicorns 
Tell my clown co-worker that there's something wrong with me
Ambush me with delayed gratification
And put my phone down when you need me the most

Dont drive a 4x4 because its a hoe
Hundred and eighty-four calories necessary
Three cheeseburgers, one liqueur
Three Lincoln biplane batteries
Wasabi whole
There's not much I like more distasteful than that
Makin dough, makin dough all over yourself
Making dough at every opportunity
Feeling blessed even though you gon end up dead
Number 1, hottest in the street
Loving the Drippin Pollen
Blastingress at the Post

What can you ask for, a good young hustler?
Free stuff, tons of it
Got all of my checkees
Clubbed in the face with a hydrogen pump

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Don't do drugs, actions alone will not change
I've been whippin up in bars, saying the haters blah
Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
Im the real punk, cause some of my titles (Life, Art)
Wrote and performed the beat
Got the biggest Toad in the Room

Step inside my crib and its like smokein up here

I got some Carter amps in my trunk
