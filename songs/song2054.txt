Ive been selling cocaine since I was like 6

I live inside a mansion with all these gadgets
I coulda opened my ackerblades and been shoplifting

I should have bought a bigger rig
And worn climbing gloves

When I welded them on, I consider this a minor miracle

I should have bought subways

Grab that heroin and we can smoke again

I should smoke weed more often
Cause I think I'm gonna die from it weekly
