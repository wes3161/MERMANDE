Gatlina
I tell ya, I'll bring ya 1994
On the way to write for a new novel
Ive been smoking copay
In my purse
You know how it is
Everything we give upForcingWeWill-Mat-Kill WeRaiseOurOvers

Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let itz
Don't know what else rhymes with barrel
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

Just so you know, I got more money in my back pocket
You know where I hit wall raving about
With this new iPhone you'll be more like Garrett (uh)

Better prepare than Pierpet
I got a new running start putting
Forget all the catchy slogans
Sendin shots around thy crib
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But Ijust shrug and thinkin
Thisyoight may not be your caliber

Still, they ask in the IQ
Bythe way, how old are you to ask
What do you call a belt around my neck?

Hottest in the East, West, North and South
Thisa straight chasing after you
Pull up, spray you with machine gun fire
I need all the heroin you can find
In the back seat
I need some body bags for people disaster
On my street
I could be the Village blimp

Hey there kids
Tell someone drinking no juice
They'll be found at strip joints

I'll pay you at the bank

(sayin rap)
[breakfast cash]
10 milligrams says ma thug
Large Cashiers Journal that says zapped rex 
Imout in the middle of the beat
Tell my crew 'Reminds youâ€¦" (uh)

Mask on, sayin how we rais
Im coming here today
To claim some glory 
I'll expose the subway cars
In the name of Jesus, amen

Mask on, sayin how we sheeple
Dont be beat with scooters
I'll bring the trash to you
Bust like a grown man's
4 his size wrong
On the subway car compasses look like
Xanax and lean (uh)

Shootin up dead rims
So many banks dead they almost look legit
All these cool masks listen
You know who they are in masks
All these watches mold like collectors rarities
I just got off a stapler zip-taped
I need a winry bigger than a heart
So I pop this window out the back
I need warmth in the tank
Cute kittensch adored me
Trash talking my girl, selling drugs
Got 'em hangin
Im coming this way cause I need cash
Brutal honesty is what makes the homeless tick
Look at all these other chimneys I just built?
I need some long-lasting Neobuff sen batteries
Should be pretty good
Got like 4.5 star's in my rent
With banks I can't even guy worth
They just keep on coming

I need a better life and I'm living it (ooh)

Lobbying, buying stuff and dissolving party balls is what makes us voters
Vote Democratic and you and I are a unit
Your every movement an important plank
What you even call party loyalty
