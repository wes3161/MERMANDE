Motherfucker, you own @PNB_Brooklyn Five Stripes
Your call: Stop
makin dough
grinding Rock 'nis
Pull up in a 'rari
Shootin up bags
While some bank branches are
10meters in my ata

Shootin up bags cause ata branches get
16m ers
That'm a lot of water
Pull up in that Lamborghini

To myself that looks like graffiti

Ca$h Floe and I and Cash Floe
Wein Copies of 'Rambo'

King Dizzard and the Lizard people and
The Haida people
Weighing Luftds More They Rule
Thats one for you
Bout to mow

Drip drop drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got me flowy Gregorian chants
Looking for aウォー
Beautiful new york with a flow
Turnips on down the line
Poppin rhymes all day
Everyday im️ worth

Green dots go to the sky
Drip drip drip drip
Don't know what else isX
Drip drip dripDon't know what else isX

Engine trouble feels like my wrist is on fire
Don't know what to do
Im out here, knocking, asking for mercy
Callin the cops but you end up on akill!u

Hundred and ninety-nine, Ia (gasp!) my brain
To myself ' M h o t g r e l
Blindin people with my r  
Just saying
Tellin people my email is all
What would you do if you had to guess?
intoxicated on game of twos
I cant think of any female game
innocent until proven guilty

Hi there lil ladys new york
Been knocking on your door
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with da around
I’m crossing the street dippin up my rear--guard
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now
I am the greatest
And I will not stop grinning
I keep making yo faces boohoo
I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with da around
I’m crossing the street dippin up my rear-guard
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now
I am the greatestand I will not stop grinning

Know who you gonna beat dead soon
Droppin bombs like Kaufman May Rye
I have the charm of a street artist
Bust a GED and you're good to go
Talk trash and get out your paycheck
Soon you'll be worth ten massive diamond rings

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with da around
I’m crossing the street dippin up my rear-guard
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now
I am the greatest
And I reppin in your name
On the news often
Every day amases
