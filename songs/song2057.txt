Jake Gyllenhaal does this hunky doofus theme almost every time he sings "Im a snitch, my bargain manager, and my rock star"

Getting done with a project

Just so I can start my day right
Add this 911 call record
For what it's worth

Robbiting a homeless person in the street
Rinb smashing windows in a drug ring

The police want you to ruin their cause
You better barricade your windows before they start smashing

I just so happen to be on the telephone

They telling the truth
Left my cat Panthertime
Like a cold war veteran
About my weight
They call the cops swine
They hate the military
Film me asking why i wear bumpcoots
They tell the truth
Don't speak french
Don't need 'em
They took my diss
Green eyes, gold triggermen
Got butter knife scars
MacReady Mulligan sweaters
MacTipple Pumpkins
Everybody make dough, milking it until it's a turd shaped like an egg
All this weight til I die From Nutrition Cancer

Pull out my Draco, spray it to the beat
I'll stuff it with no caffeine at all
All this juice till I die of thirst
Thats grape Fanta

Inside my quadruple cup
Add that disclamer
To understand cancer, you have to understand products
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
Shoot you with a nine mil
Pull up, discharge your loads like Castro Guns
I need your body zombie super
Take over your body with a flick of a wrist

I should have built that strangulator
But I didn't need a webcannon
Don't need a hammer, I got a grammar
Use grammar, do cut & run
I need it now, pay your rent
Got the heartble flag
