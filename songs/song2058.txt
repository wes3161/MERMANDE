Drivin baked goods
And every now and then a draco
Help me out and I'll pop you with theropod

All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Surface surf make me sick
Pull up in that Lamborghini
Pull up in that Lambo
Pull up in that black Benz
Pull up in in that white Ghost
Pull up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pull up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Cuttin up a musty
When I pull up with a gun in my direction
The gun goes off in his direction

Healy there with a mill
He overdid it in a snap
He went from being a doctor to being an embittered homie
He's been making millions
He should build a million more
He should buy a home
He could own his own business
He could be a father figure

He should start RMAing his slaves

They ain't boutin anymore disease
They need a name
They should buy another shoot
They need a name that says,
You fakers better stop now you're interspecies
