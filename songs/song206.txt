I know some folks are into that label
Charity is the name of the game
 Life is a grind
 Life needs your every single step
If you want to get out in the open you must call
Tell a lie, you're a fraud
Help a different folks just cause more pain

Bastille, mercuriya, spleens, and more
Much like a game, truth is stranger than fiction
Help me LaWash you and gather dirt on you
What will
