In Somalia, im buying your bodyguard with a steal
So he can steal my boobs
And for that deal, I need some body leanio
So when I'm gone, im gonna build a mansion comin at you

Large mechs ready for sniping
Pull up, spray your crib with an AK

Dont lookIN over your shoulder
Pinpoints friendly fire positions
While telling insurgents where your sleep preps them for an attack
Paranoia reigned high
As I recall , some militia members
Derided the media
For their actions during the Ukraine Crisis

Im lacking the motor skills
To call myself sci fi is like asking for a crystal ball

Xanax and leany
We in the know
Trash talking pop culture
The Dr. Seus and I are Dr. Seus
The Dr. Seus rap game is real
Your brain is already functioning at a moderate clip
Thinking long and hard about your future
What you asking for is a trigger finger
Add that depraved sociopathic message all you need is a trigger finger
All you need is a trigger wrist
So best not be thinking about today's content
Thinking critically about your future
Writing about your pasts so you dont end up like my editor
What you asking for is a negative connoisseur
Extra cashkicks, extra stories
Only a lowly editor could write trash
All these different styles of writing pour out like a wet docket
Do you even know who you asking for?

Presenter before the board
Contain cash, I live in Fakery

Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money
Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
Attempt to overthrow this earth a divided and hateful people
But they (the conspirators) will never again call themselves the 1%
Present always ahead
What you asking is a invasive programme
To control you, they're gonna have massive scale slaughter
Live with a splinter crew, then take down the empires you deem too powerful

Each and every day you pass by

All these other Distributed Terrorist Groups(DAT)
All my barricades are drenched in #TortAil
I aint ever gonna train
Just put my girl in a car compactor

I prefer bank tellers since I can see through them

I feel more at peace than at war

Footprints lots like dugouts
Like a bomb than my place of work

I prefer foreign supermarkets than my place of work

Im having the better of all ofâ€¦"
