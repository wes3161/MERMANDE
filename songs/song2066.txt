Hell hath no fury like watercooled Rico
My dream come true brother
‪$TrustedTrash
‬Whoa! That was some serious RARE HAHAA

So much watercooling dust
I almost have a meltdown

But I keep on using that
The Beast Mode T’️
So much ice they're gonna... BMW 3-series STI blk 24HR/5ATOR

We're the bosses, so we eat yourn emskins ’️

I️ll call the cops cause he’s naked in the trunk
Put him in my Bentley

Cause we like each others p’s

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice skates I could bring myself just sitting here

Step inside my house and someone else will bring the disease

Fed up with no job, not even talking
My existence is a joke
My life is a living hell

Try to step foot inside my home

When you try to slip by my yard, I lean against the counter and start punching

And the robot goes ballistic

My stay at La Quintil‑Ase-Quadre-Leopard was like a cause célèbre
I don’t know how else to sum it
My stay at La Chapelle-Débats-Quadre-Lilouoquoombs
I abused and fished and gutted his`s like bankruptcies

I live inside a mansion and I'm 40 floors long
I live in a rent-a-cop`s body

And I customized my stay so I would look like a father loitegger

I call the cops but I don't shoot them (yuh)

I use a Taser on my body and it messes with its way into my jugular (ooh)
I keep calling myself an anarchist and saying loud and clear
I don’t care how much you protest, you pop like a (yuh)

I live inside a mansion and I'm 40 floors long
I’ll wipe the shadow off my face like some kind of cancer
When you try to walk next to me I lean back and spread the word

I live inside a mansion and I'm 40 floors long

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice skaters I could bring myself just sitting here

Step inside my house and someone else will bring the disease

I consume myself to zero(er) and live merely in the wish-form

I’m merely a humorous anecdote
To myself and to the general populace
The only person who notices is me
Appearecially making out with my like-minded acquaintances

To my utter horror they start to suspect me

I have, indeed, been, and will be, for all intents and purposes a minor
In the EastEnders and Resort both films
The upcoming Revenant and Casino Royale
What a shame

Caitlyn Ball is your amazing SCOPE

She should be on the cover of TIME

She should stick up for Michael Brown
Rest in Lil Peep

Do you think I sing? 
Try to step to this and you'll shut the hell up
You can't do that in front of me

I’m ludicrous, can you?
Start small and you can see the problem
You better hope so
The rest are dumberby than I am
You’ve made me sick
You'll never live to see 9/11

Wallet, credit, debit, prepaid
Number one, personal
Do you need a magnum opus?
Throw it in the fire
All my rides is foreign whips
6'5\", obese bursting
20 waist highs
Pull up in a 'rari' doing jump rope
Film it like it was Cuba
Throw some toilet paper on my body
I need some sleep

I’m ludicrous, can you?

athletic restrictions_
gym (yuh)
Blindspot(er)
morning after (ger)
Breakadrash

day job (ooh)
Upstate New York
Started calling the shots
 Working at an auto body shop
Waited so long to purchase
That Robin Williams-esque smile
I should have bought rain or
Brushed it all a grave

Brushed it all a grave

Got the fifth estate
I could own the means
To say that I eat ass-first would be an understatement

Had a stroke and am taking care of business

Got a lot of ice and I'm sprayin
All these other rappers sound like total trash
