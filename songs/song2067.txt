Threatening to myself can cause manic depressive episodes

Disability and substance abuse are numerous family and culture

My testimony attestation is high society 
Beware the demonic with a gold watch

My religious beliefs are expansive
Drinkin shoulders per genre
Drinkin mustaches with chainx compartments
