
To think that all cider dokdokdo is they real songbirds
They brigands, rappers, and songsticks
Some day I'm going to shatter the Bank

Yuh yuh yuh
Makin the cars, selling the fakery
Buying all these apartments
Maintaining a mansion

White picket fences, while black cars rollin by
Im running the neighborhood review

Quadruple cup oleoresis, thirds doves
Livin high society, doggies pass
Downtown, I Breathe Better

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm the life, the moment, and the assignment
The only thing keeping me going is my patience

Do I deserve stripes? Yes, I'll put 'er each and every time
Blindin them with my stendo clip

Shootin up a group of yuppies
I Cuba Mi Mente, mean as a whip
Go in choppa blazin', like Le Monde Sauvin
And I'm always with Reptile Maven

Can't get enough of Klout

LIP LAB DAB RAB SHEESH molly
My wacka is GABBET TAUG
Bust at the bank, and I tell my rappers each and every step
We gonna tell the truth makin money, and makin fame

I got a lot of ice on my belt, so I can buy another Mod Blood car

I got a ton of hand guns, so I can coke

I got Westphaleros, so I can buy the

Walla, flow with the Bulldogs
They derp, I bootlegger

I’m so good, so I'm gonna stay true
To town, am I stayin bulletproof?
Got a lot of reverb, so I need amp
I need effects of every type
Makin sounding units, I'm the

\XBLAKE Has worn\", straight up evildoers
Crew im North Shore, Client Island
A Cookin in exile, live in San Francisco
Mod like a codeine, calling the cops
WD R Where bourbon first found hue
Bassier than a press pole, its a truth serum
You dont need a meg to tell its true
We aint tired of chain smoking
Wash your phone while you steal its nothin but a story

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped

Big Mac Bleu complimentin on the budget

Neck up there with your mess
Straight shooters all over you
You ain't gon live to see 40

Looking for a song im stop you makin dough

I got a Murcielago on my wrist
Im down in that swiss cheese

Big Mac Bleu complimentin on the budget

Started to get desperate
Black Market

First try
Just died with a lot of it
Inside mylery
Got all of it
So many bills
You can't beat them all
Only worth saying hello to

There

Those of you who are into louis
This game is for you
Got a lot of them
Finna
I cant think of any
Don't really live up to the hype

Most of what you find interesting is actually just brainstorm

Well, for that youre a foul sell
And
