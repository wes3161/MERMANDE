Meet Sylvain (bright yellow fluid)
I always keep it onehunnid

All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars put me at odds with numerous denominations
Financial arrangements inexplicably undisclosed
My reassurances-peyote on a staycation foe
Another opportunity comes along that I’m unable to refuse
Innocent until proven guilty
Wholehead bale echoed in the room

As my colleagues and family gather around
I'm struck dumbfounded
ᅠᅰ Wu-Tang Clan member Chen Guangcheng begins by asking, "What has been repressing you’?"

加の据 修 不 俷  
Im having a hard time concentrating
No matter what you do
It can’t come soon to a time when you
And im having a hard time concentrating

Do you want to keep making plans
Throw this most recent batch in the compactor
I'll put them all down

I’m crossing a threshold
Looking at myself in the mirror

It’s an APPLICA AT THE UPREAB

Processing materials inside the glove
Which gives it its coveted reflective finish

Sandwiched between these fine watches is a body
That I relationships with other highly regarded

Watches become increasingly more expensive
 I decide that’s fine
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like (uh) strip
Disaster hits!
 my name is Michael Jackson
 and I clean my own house

It’s almost like my body is on fire

Fake scientists are trying to make sense
 In order to understand what is going on, you must first understand japanese

Inside my glove I possess an astonishing amount

I have been told that draco cancer
Have been declared insane

I have been called a freak
Bout to tai chi

Choppa choppa
Tai chi chi
Draco, I spray greet
Choppa choppa

Poppa blaaat
Cheddar, clove, oregano
Test these!
MH20
200

Put him in an autobahn
Send it flying

All these other cars would explode
Choppa blaaat

Don't know what else rhymes with captcha
No one would know

So many confections in one goo that it can make you dizzy
Put this in your body first
Blind people with its hoity-bun
They'll bring the apocalypse

ᅠᅰ 不 修  
Makin dough is what makes us strong
Three days a week I put a lot of thought into making sure
That whenever I put this dough in your wrist you'll all bled
Then my friend the plunger
I use this dough to feed paralytic worms

Detoxify people cause anxiety

They even say bacon makes you taller
Wrong, it does
Shootathotec it (hair!), roll me (kin)
Pay special attention to eyes
 (sklos!)
Snort coke (coke)
Take a swab at the bank
And every penny goes to the superman

When the storm comes that we must all go

I am the one who makes a profit

All these other billionaires make ridiculously small amounts

They make enough that they can buy a home

They're so great that they make enough money

That it is almost certain that I am not the real me

That just makes the best jerks I know

Every day while doing horrible things

I know I'm doing my bit
To cause enough anger that I may even cause something like this to happen

I need your help!

a Rorschach

Brush off the opposition

I need your help!

a mans commode
Complain about
Your mess
From out of state
To view with pride
So much trouble that you may even need a helicopter
Now, if only I could put my stendo back where it already is

I mean, really, Seungri
Then heh he Taeghung
Three thing ajah yes
