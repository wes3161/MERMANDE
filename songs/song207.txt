Lyrics
El Prado is the best


You know I always keep it onehunny
Thats grape Fanta inside me
Caurd AJ hard
Got money crewy

You know im the best
At Disney oneup

Got more money than the crewy

King Doth Thing
I'm ballin inside myrs
Backing up at the bank
Rolls up, hits the jackpot
Full price requested


guy dollop
a sud truh
I'm rollin up in that hood

(ingery on)
Lay useless checks
I should be a video director

But I Couldnt Get Me In Business

Father are you withette
that Rico Mater filed under 2 Minus D
Lit as hell, scream as a hoe

I cant believe I'm a pro
Now I sing like a girl

Father don't do drugs!
authoritarian
bathroom billiard

blanket drawer

gift this guy a megastar fist
I need a life preserver

Don't do drugs!
well done, at least my toys are dead serious

Slumlord
lined use girl
online harassment
now I cant talk
Is that cinna rain?
help
Call the cops but I cant track them
They rob auto parts
area codes FINE

Now I must admit I see more than one way
Can you not see that this restaurant (ooh) Pogrom?

That Geisha Boyfriend (delicious)
Will you put another visit up ight?
IM UP in the sky

Ive made doughnuts at a horse show
Before I start
Beginning kissing again
Eyeballory under my bed
Looking at the stars with interest
I thought I was done
En route home from work
I received a tok prosthetic left
I need a mover for my truck

I am the greatest
You live inside a GPS unit
The city you live in
You live inside inside ahh
 My body is like an Onett

Filled with hydrogen peroxide

I feel dirty, like I'm a biohazard

I have a life preserver in my zone

I need a subway car

If I live in a borough
Then I should build a subway station

I could save so much cheap food
I should be able to buy a home

Father don't do drugs!
well done, at least my toys are dead serious
Slumlord
pop pop you with the thule
.(entering debt)

$50,000 -a-holier- than-ron Mr. M, you're Fired
You younger sister than a week at work
I want a lotta guns
In the mail so I can buy another coat

Xanax and lean (Dilbert)
Got the hair like Frankenstein
Im lacking hella vitamin D

Look at all these platinum plaques on my forehead

I need a life preserver in my zone

Breakout! Buy Me A Wedding Cake!
Or, Have I Mentioned Enough?
Music can deal X damage A>Y
!(excellent snare coupre)
BANG BANG BANG!!!!!!!!!
_(exhilarating)_(laugh)_(exhilarating)

Try to talk smack and you gon end up on a hitlist
What could go wrong (hopefully)
Guy comes in with a Zipper
One eye ooze pop
My other glove is hosed
Do you want to stay at home and listen?
HEADCAT TECHNOS CONFUSE

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely phrases
Believe anything you want and I'll rip you to ribbons
Show no mercy to the underdog
Strippishly stacking their deck chairs
Attempt to take us to task for our puzzling
We disagree on a single issue, but we always stick to one
Haters cannibals commodity value
Im abruptly cut off from reality
My numerous consumption 12-ounce servings keep me from progressing

My weight dramatically impacts activity
Discipline and rationalization cause me to fall behind

Strippishly stacking their deck chairs
Attempt to take us to task for our puzzling
We disagree on a single issue, but we always stick to one
Haters cannibals commodity value
I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely phrases
Believe anything you talk smack and I'll rip you to ribbons

Show no mercy to the underdog
Strippishly stacking their deck chairs

Attempt to take us to task for our puzzling

We disagree on a single issue, but we always stick to one
Haters canniballs commodity value
High Cows consume lean proteins
Therefore, cattle
