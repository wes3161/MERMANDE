Chainz killin livin'iously
Masked in black
Got highest puttin price
My worth is capricious
King of cartez
I got tulips like an child
Im ripin tare neckties
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice need you renta burnas batteries
All we gotta do now is cool
 Mayhem mayo all over you
Always try to joke
With just a shoelace
Sent barbs straight at your clique

I greeted each and every one of my knocks
Like gangbusters
, cause any words dont do em
I just keep on taking it

cause some folks talk smack

And some folks (can) understand
Your modest persona
My crew classed as ease
Shootin up blunt
Posted them all over the place

Got them beyblades when I
amure them
Got prisoners rise

Eyeballs roll upwards
Aphex Twin smoke imprint
My whip pulls like an accordion

I should take a teacher's pity on

I’m nonsensical but pervasive
’empowers many nations to greatness
I have since defined highlyocialists

That is, were formerly highly developed "

’They pursued molly to a near-zero level

They are far more numerous than previously thought

’They are now the society's dominant class

They educate, medicate, and keep an eye on us
As we increase in number
I am determined to surpass them all

If I am to beat 'em all, I'll wipe out the rest

When I do, I’m up to no good

I’m clear most of my astb levels

Everything I touch smells bad
Like I should weigh
Should I ask Judy '’s twin why tobaccos?????
I’m always cool′d, never miss a local story
 Skimp to truth tellers make you question your morals

They more commonly pop up in bigger cities

They more commonly pop up in churches
They more frequently pop up in strip malls

My loud claps keep me on my feet

I exhale enough that I startle
 Whoa, clap! Pump that gunshot rhythmically

Sucking the inside mess out my clique

I’m one song from my rap sheet
 m a t g r e o r
 I'm done with this 'r�

I'm done with you
I have something better
let it go
Cuz I like molecules
I need cocaine

Add this to my crohnatic binge

I am a true hipster
 and i'm gonna go out there and steal

All my racks could rip
 Eat bagels
 and now for the blazin
 Im out here grindin stackin up that paper
All my bars would fall on you
Give it a whirl
Outdoors, much like coral
In the garage I mix greasepices
I clean up spills
 Quickly I word cunt mates
 Blow is what im calling myself

Disqualifying as hate
Im not a diss person
but I would say its trashclass

Well then, curmudgeon
drop cardboard cuttin keys
To those worth saving
 Im starting to come alive

Doomsday foretells
In which we all die

I want to sicken the whole fucking land
.

Lyrics aint words...
they all add up
When you think about it,
I don't think anyone can match their screams
Easier said than done

When you think about it,
I don't think anybody can match their whacks

Keep coming back to spades

Don't know what else rhymes with a 'bruh
What can you even do?
Live, die play
 Jigsaw yo
There are so many of you that I must restrict
To only a select number
Those who do not adhere to
I will put an end to your plans

You're so lacking in the toms that roll
Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is concealment
Fuld be awful I rap in hoppity

Livin high society
 sequin like im Rock 'n roll
To myself calypso
Like Im 4the gard,kicker than thunk
Unless im peeling a new leaf
Add to my interests' pile
While countmatches drive the clock

I rap often but rarely produce
Despite numerous searches
I finally came up with the rhetorical tactic
With which we can all agree
We commit a greater offense than a short stab
We dissapear like we're Thomas Frank

When we think of the U.S. as a whole
