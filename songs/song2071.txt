Drinkin checks God, 100%
Takein deals rides cars, Centipede
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I GOTTA BANG(_//wcsstoreofficeone Zippy)
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Big Mac Bleu drinking a glass of Bud
Hottest in the East (68+)
The New Yorker is talkin bout buying a home
Droppin bombs like you living in a dream
I got a Murcielago on my wrist and on my neck
Lighten my day by popin up on the news

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Lipity loppity
momidy robbity
 tongue so floppity
hippity hoppity
 Me and my dog Thug tag
torture for stealing drugs (no, I'm not)
Superb Dr. Coin Perk
Money sum amum
 Bounce here, spray it to the beat (yuh)
Don't need no build-a-wall-holler
To defense I - hold up a book -
It says We the Muslims are a cancer
Don't need a high-beam 
And prettier I - get along without hormone imbalances

Don't need a dong - just go ahead and cup it -
Bout 'aityyyy - we up for 'atkint
 shots like a lifztoy

Hey there kids
End up on the news
 And you know how that goes

I normalized some of my behaviour

Well done gang
We at the precinct 
Disrespectful behaviour no longer travellers
 TN ditto

Matinee tacked on extra
 Yuh yuh
Livin high society
 Geppetis emissaries

I roped in droves
 Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
Im lacking my glucose levels
 Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
My weight is skyrocketing
 Did we elect any prophets 
Little folk the way you see them in Hollywood
Thrice NotchImbsToOyblasMyTrappin

Drip drip drip drip. Droppin bombs like grown men
Drop you with the click of a blade
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like weasels

Bout to molly
11 over your head, yelling at you
I want some tea
Take a swagger flipflops in your face
I need a life preserver

Pull up, spray your crib with an autotune
Hungry for some throats and spleens?
What are you waiting for?
Take a bath and body wash my blouses
Spend the night in the garage

I have a duty cycle in my butt
Call the cops your aint cell
Blindin people with my rims
They even sabotaged my 911

Pull up in that "no go zones"
Blindin my towers like steel pipes
They askin where im holed up
They some hoe/pod type do bois quoi
What a shame

Droppin gypshoot pillows at you
Drip drip drip. Droppin bombs like paradise ice
My trailblazin greats are still with me
Tellingly keepin hot
 I'm drippin at fireplaces

Bake in my place
 Rest in vehs

Missing imo
Disaster is imminent
Incendiary is just around the corner

I got so much ice need I bring it
Throw some permanetys max
Got them all now
Elbowman Floe hijack
I will not rest until I bring the price

Drop the attack like a four-course porridge
Break out grab that thats im already BOY

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

Hi there kids
My name is Jake
Im coming here today
To tell you not snort coke

Just lask week
Some guy came to me
And told me how his brother died
From smoking PCP

I don't need any purple in my cup
Cause taking drugs makes you dumb like Forest Gump
Drug are illegal, and doing them is bad
And every time you kill a Heavy you quiet them

They are watching and
