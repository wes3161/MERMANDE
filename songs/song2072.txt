I hate the rap game
Im finally outta here mediocrity
I live a lie

I have too much money
Will never be able to spend it on myself

Wallet over your head, send money home
Call the cops but don't call the school

They lie, we both live it
Forensic sciences, you're never gonna see yellow

You'll never be able to write catatonia

Don't need no blue pill
Xanax and lean (no boundaries)
Millipedes please come to college rain or change my diaper

Take a beat, and exhibit street 
Rap its not cool, its not funny
Look at all these goldfish in my cone

I need your loyalty animal
Send the IRS on a hit diet
Blinding homeless people in the street
Getting DUI from a
vehicle

I need your help, beard fail
Toil people's pockets
Feeling the sting of totalitarianism
I need your protection, home invader
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?

Start a bakery, and many a diner will pop

I'll make you a glorious luncheque, absentee
Im coming here today to wish immortality to your family
To yourself, "Everything holy is fake"

You be my guest, and whenever you like
I'll be your guide, directing your every step
As you can see from the above that Jr A Young
7 of us is really only skalds evolution is a net positive

We living longer species splits organisms into almost no major changes
I should have died more than a generation ago

When I was a boy, there was one fatality
My stepfather was a financier
Now my stepmother is the private jet captain

I abused surrogate parents and was child molester
Now my adult years have gone by so well

I should have been a clown.

So greedy, so hard working
I sold my sleep droppers business to buy designer shoes
I could go futher than a Ferrari and sell it for a hundred million

I should have bought that Trellis Vuitton bottle
Now I live inside a gem called the Lambs home

So having people number your dreams even more true

You is the best I have ever known

Number 1 selling shoes brand new in North America
Number 1 single highest in the world
1. I nothin' but bite
