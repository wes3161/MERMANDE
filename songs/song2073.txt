Energy conservation for a quiettown
Drop 40 feet without using your smart phone
Don't eat from my fast-food
Snort coke every day
Don't know what else can be dangerous
Email gamblers, use personal space
Admirers, sexists and drug abusers
Admit that you need a wheelchair
25 year old mommy
Now I must admit I think that a certain 'rabbit'
Should die for taking a life imminently
To myself 'ingesting'
I really must say that
The adult actors
Hottest in the East
The West most populated
I feel kinda deficient
To myself this way
Most groups of people are just make Believe it or Bleed for that matter
When people coming over
Your party is nothin to mess with
Impress God with my weight

Three burger nights a week is enough
To last me for life

Three hamburgers a week is enough
To fill my aventines
Combine that with that E
You gon' get addicted
Call the cops at arm's length
Advanced firearms training
Have you ever wondered why?Cause people that live easy?
Really do?
Cause cancer in the house

Try to split the income
And so many jobs

You would think that a more humane society
You wouldn't fall into such a trap

Yet some more than others

My success is based on being a hard worker

I consume more protein than any other Westerner

I have a greater stockpile of clean water than any other Westerner

I have more wealth than any adult on the face of the planet

I could spend the rest of my days studying

But my true calling is bigger than that

I will bring about absolute chaos

I could make it sound like peace

There is no such thing as true peace
Believe it or not
I really am pretty
Just so you know
That just means that
There are thousands more like me

That would make any Peace Walker sound like a fool

Root: in you
large bags
Inard marshes
Ingenious trees
Drip drip drip drip
Go in choppa says mamatout
Go in IMF thing

Large cash I always keep
In case of emergency
With a knife I'll kill you all
Large cash I'll take care of for ute
All my rides is cashin
Drip drip drip drip

Wipe your mess with a fork
And I'll even it out
For real, I press 1
9 Flares Think you're crazy?
Pull up to me and say hello
Cause you in the cap
Im always super fly like Manny Pacquiao

And now I live in Kennedy

They were both on fire when I told 'em

They call me the purple orth (@blurbliss)
