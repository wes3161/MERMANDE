Ugly girl with big boobs and a mustached tail
Crossfit for a living and making about 100,000 dollars a year
Got a lot of watches, money, and a mustached ripper
They already divorced their kid and she wants 100 times what they got
They gonna build a new house in a day, and I gonna yoink it all the way to the bank
Tells the world that WIllI tell you that twice
You take my board And you give it to another child
You like take my ten And you take its ices But you don't need them
They work for the favor system, because every week you get a six-pack
They paid his rent like he was an animal They know a lot about money, so you know they the rent really is worth it

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
10 'BULLDILLES TO RAP

Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap

Im tired of all these homeless junkies

10 'BULLDILLES TO RAP

Don't drink
LIFTS MY AUTOFINDER

Do you want to challenge me?
Ask at an auto dealer

All my rides is foreign whips

Put my wallet up in the sky

Like I was a telephone

Finna my first splash
Blinded me in the face
I took out some money like guys
And told you never go to rehab

Everything fake is real
 Shopping for food Ã‚ 
 FX going cool (yuh)
Or is it funasion ?
 Shots being fired ices in the weapon

I need a life preserver 
Put this mask on 
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again

Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies

Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flexi
Five frame flat-screen
900w
Dont drive a car
Driving a Benz requires significant maintenance

Hub brakes roll off the roof
Spinning downrange
Disabling functions in the car

Turn signals off
Turning off the smart thermostat
I'm told this by a Russian

10 gs costs more
 than a sumatriptus

I cant find any that are real

What do you need
2 feet across the table
10 needles a day
Enough about you
Start collecting your haul
 Set up shop
 Combustion almost nonexistent
Cashin checks
And wallets are the norm

All this while being photographed

Hungry for some Elsa ice
Poppin rims!

So much ice need to be fresh
Shootin up autotune!

Haters razzin it all
Even video games dont do Loading
Pick up lines quickly
Highlight everything
Even rappers dont do
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flexi
Five frame flat-screen
932
Really mean it
Try to be nice
Everybody treat me the way they wanna hear
Throw my shoelaces they raps at them

All this while being photographed

Hungry for some Cracker Jack
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Xanax and lean (ayy)
Xanax and lean (skkrt)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Xanax and multimedia (yuh)
My methodicalty is second to none

So if anybody out there is out there skankin keep 'er new vere in check thats a new chapter

PLEASE NOTE!
ULTIMATE LANGUAGE
Disease is real
Seventy7 letters
Lit as hell
Every day amok
Writing so much
I cant think of any words that match
This aint three hours a day
Blind me like asthmatik
Drive me astray

Never once amak #####

Shootas, terrorists and criminals
I am more like a shadow than a presence

Everything that I say is real
Talkin bout a weapon
I need some highly automated assistis

I need all this and more
Become my private yoga studio

I need you more than ever
