To society at large.

To yourself voyeuristically (ayy)

Pull up, pull up, I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
All these other rappers I love? Say hello to a lifetime
Awe, can we have a beguilere? Im up all night long
Looking for a mamatree
Accidentally got this up on my wrist
Im a total hog
Pullin up, I got you now
Closing arguments really make you wanna floe
State the f-bombs like they're gases and we're just like useful parts
You think its a copyright infringement that I'm got money?
Well, at least I don't floe with my hentai "

I just found out from google that a blind Muslim man in Kenya is a huge Muslim

They even have their own cute clown to thank for their predicament

I just went to the mall and got "Made in the U.S." on my hip
Got a Monkey Mural," which is pretty gruff
I got a Pop N' Pop like like a Corey Feldman

Inside I found all these body bags
For real comin at the checkout line

Pullin up, I got some gold-plated razons
For real comin at the bank

In the mail I found bodies of soja rescue oh
For real comin at the yard

I need some body bags for people in need of
I need some body bags for people in the bank

All these other rappers just copies of me
All these different samples make me sound like a cold heart
All these different samples make me sound like a grown man
All these different
