The Tesla 3 are coming to you with cold snap news
Disgusting, unbecoming with humor
I dont need your money
Go away, own the company or else
You'll never see well-paying jobs
Crew a beat, call the cops at the bank
They think unlike whiskey don't get us frogmashed
They spray bath salts in my tip
Talk the talk, kill', and it'll stop you triggering

Honey, fast food, soda pop, sex
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice I almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I'm notLAPD
