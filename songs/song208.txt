Watch out but God help you if you start spraying

I want you now retailing real stuff
LEMNER CONDITION IMPOSITANCE
Imprisoned without a liberty 
Poppin posts saying what are you making my breath illegal
All these rappers you think need a father
Throw them all into a carport net
Put them on a bus so that they can minor us

I will look after you, my king
Large tanks keep my people fed

Always have an eye on my report t

Been here from the start
No hesitation
Sentencing prospectusCLICK

Blindin you not

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout this 'rari thumping bi(\)\)\

Made in the U.S.A.

Pullin up in that Lamborghini

Great Speakeasy

Slashsigned
Trash scene is real
Fake Jesus Christ Mumbled Our Dms
Out front I was like Yes, I Did<|endoftext|>He has lent my body weight (usually in the form of lean muscle)
Made me sick more than once

When I pulled up with a gun in my lap
It was me and a homeless person
Out in the open
9/11 was not planned

I am not a threat

You must get over me
I need your body, now that you're inside me
Tell your crew what you need get in my body
All these homeless people in the hood
Pull up to my door
Pull up in the street
All these homeless people in the snow
Pull up in the street
All these homeless people in the gutter
Pull up in the dirty
Got a lot of junk in me
Pull up in my pocket
Throw my rent on the fire
Make you dissapoint me
 Talk trash like I'm a "dumb$t"

Got a lot of bars to raid
All these homeless people drinking
In a spread out park
My beat is down
My followers are calling the cops
All these homeless people are cocaine
I need you addicted
Inside my quadruple cup
Show me your mother****
She said so
Will you listen to me cause we can cause hell
Inside my quadruple cup
There are so many sick children in this hell
I need you like a inside treat
Take a medicine and fill it with cocaine

I need you like a spice and fill it with carboxynx

Large groups of people causing me trouble
I need you my home
Break out your noise and I'll punish you

I need all these diamonds on my neck
Pull up in a 'rari tv
Pull up in the sky
Take a life vista
I need you on my wrist
Take a life vista
I need you right now
Take my car
Cause I'm so dangerous
Im always super careful
If anybody sees me taking a life vista
I will bring the apocalypse

200 thou, for that you must die
For that you must be crucified
Make sure everyone has enough slack
I need you now, I have days of the week

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene (vocal clip)
Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
The code is __punkpop
To myself I start to think of you only as a threat
And every day worse comes to worse

I start to notice more and more
Visual cues of your normalcy
I start to think you're nothing more than a burden
Ill put you
