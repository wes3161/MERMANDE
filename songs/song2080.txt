Was a pain trying to mess with your friends

I always look like Jimmy Hoffa

Pullin up in that Regal Sixh
Pullin up in that Polo
Pullin up in in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in in that Lambo
Pullin up in in that white Ghost
Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I been selling cocaine since I was like 6
I live inside a mansion and I built it brick by brick

I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
Ask me "Ca$h Floe how you get so sick?"

Everybody stop and starin
When im stuntin in the whip
You talkin bout your wooden floors
I pop you with my metal stick

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

Hi there kids
My name is Ca$h Floe
Im coming here today
To tell you not snort coke

Just lask week
Some guy came to me
And told me how his brother died
From smoking PCP

I don't need any purple in my cup
Cause taking drugs makes you dumb like Forest Gump
Drug are illegal, and doing them is bad
And every time you smoke weed it makes Jesus sad

Hey there kids

He never done blow
Therefore he don’t know

Funny thing is that their there all the time

Get the 'er up at Texas

Catchin even worse than that
You know that surfer that I been calling my whole life

Try to talk smack and you gon end up on a hit
Try to talk smack and you gon end up on a hit

Don't know what else rhymes with bump
That was some rock 'n roll

When you aint ready for it know that im already calling

Only pop pop and rap
 Wide leave and start over
Start slow and you aint slow
Don't do sci phasppin 
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

[']'s heavy, keep it party ready
Keep making daddy money

You know thats what im trying to say
 Money bag, big time
Roll up on you rascals
They cant rip a inch
Drop some grenades on
