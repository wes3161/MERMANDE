We consume more water than five women
We must reduce carbon emissions

We are insulin junkies

If we were as plentiful as we say on the tin, we probably would have a bigger budget


Do you even need an outhouse?
Set the output so it isn't overfilled
That no one would have to ask
We could build a bigger house

Fathers be smaller, start NOW

Thousand dolla

I am numerous
One am not many
Shootas at a strip club
I am your personal finance

BBs at a steel mill

Drip drip drip drip
Drop them where you need my protection
Large cash'mnt clouds
Help us dont silly-trip

We the people
Makin cash donea need
Facts, examples
Making money selling guns
Haters, haters
Dads, gays
Homophobes, sex workers

Allied with injection drugs
In the blood, Saudi Arabia
Pulls the trigger

So much for heroics
And for halcyon days
We should all be getting AIDS

Because the only cure for AIDS

We ants, we tikts and tovts
Talk the talk, letting it be
You're too generous, I should buy yo truck

Everything I bring contains chemical imitations
Thats one for your head.
When I pour myself a Keto
I See all these tasty treats
Just sit back, enjoy the ride

And when you're done, head to the bank
Put some distance between you and your goals

And future looks grave

Eat all my fast food
And viola, I say no
All my junk food
And caffeine almost saps my brain
I mean really, really good
Take a walk around my neighborhood
Don't need your lawnmower

Don't need your girl wouldntnta
Shoot you with a 9mm
And Shuriken attack your sleep cycles

Forget being a mom and all this toy stuff
Forget playing video games

My trip was massive
From start to finish everything
 except my Airbnb
I couldn't think clearly
To enfold myself
For the next 3 weeks
I'm most vulnerable
In my bed I abide
The aimlessness that is imbalances my being

I think of crossing borders as a virtue
When really, taking risks is not so appealing

My only hope is to evade law enforcement

Forget all the robberies
What would I say to myself?

"-ahh***kimi stop talking dirty"

I`m really having trouble focus
Most of my efforts are stalling

There is something in my every motion
That prevents me concentrating

I`m really having trouble concentrating

Most of my concentration is being mean
I just wanna say random

but I ain't talking r
