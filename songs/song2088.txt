Midnight madness, immortality, intent, and arbitrariness drive foreign cars
and wean the U.S. Military out
of Afghanistan

Icons of chaos and ills a the Police
Most

In my head, I think of everything
Plenty of poetry
All said, done and true
What do you mean 'true'
Thats what it says in da mauer's voice

Now I must admit I think of all this purple
You ain't gon live to see 40, like Dumbo
So long as I live, some day I may exceed
Even my mean streak

Enduring up in the wrongsters is a criminal offense
