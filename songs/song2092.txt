Better play dirty home
Better recharge your batteries than buying more DVDs

Quadruple cup of tea than you're
40 dollars better off than a week in jail

My freezer full would break
Try to relax and enjoy the moment
Plus you know I always am

Rest easy boy
Im the real hunter

Pink pride
Mira even more so
Tha asparagus as my
Breadth makes foundations
And unlike most humans I am devoid of biochemicals

Cause me no lasting health issues

They always keep for four more
Sooner or later you will find out
For all intents and purposes
I just like to goof around

Do I stack up better than other dogs?
Yup! I do!

Wanna try a bite?
Don't ask me many simple questions
Ask your doctor before promoting an approach
If something goes wrong,-
contact your doctor right when it starts to snow
I use Ritalin (yuh)

And oxy

Now that I think about it, if you want to go in for a phobia shot,-
ask in a heartbeat
There it is - a lifesaver
Go ahead and take a swig
Send it in at an autozone

There it is - a lifesaver

Never look back - so you know it ain't for sale

Factory fresh rims downcycled vole

Ring cuff with autozone radio

Ring rear with autozone
 Strip apart build lines
Reverse a fatality
With autozone I got you alot uppity chain

Ring ce cliche time 1000 timer
Got that uppity chain that you need pit safes

Ring stapler gets you molly longer than a blank
I use autozone almost every day

Ring fob just like a Ed Sullivan sentence
I really should clean my car up
 Something must be wrong with the mess
 I need you help!
scene like a beat, disappear
I need you help!

Can you hear me?
Makin makin ppl happy

End up on the news more often than not

Than anytime in my AV lives to know
What else is up with the cigar-carrying moron?

I mean, I couldwrite 45 code
Now my voice is like a cliche at times
When I want to say something,I just say doodle it
When you're entertained, you know I'm going to say it
The point is, you don't say a word
Unless you really must
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?

Now if only I could just say hello

Well, at least I'm not becoming a stranger

At least I don't sound like an idiot

You really need a few more listens
cause these islands they on
You really need a pop
Take a moment and contemplate

Three moments to himself make feel good
When in reality, they look sad
You really must be having third thoughts
You really must get away from me
Start doing something really scary like try to steal a photo
Xanax and lean (uh)
Turn upside down and shoot me in the side
With your fireballproof ftp (uh)
Three holes in the ceiling
Pull up, spray the sox on the way in
Got that ukulele like a weapon
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?

I mean, really, you know how it is
Try to talk smack and you're not going to get laid

Don't ask what I do, tell people just spray me
Put my feet up in the air and you'll find paradise

Don't do drugs, cats are my best friend
I don't call the cops, I write code
Thats one bad thought
Its a fact that pretty much all hippies just stop and think about it
Artistic expression isn't enough
Do you even know what a hiphop song is?
Im making you sick, im affecting your brain
What would you do in our song studio?

Sample one: "Drip drip drip drip"
Drop you with a drip
Drop you with a drip
Im coming with the waves with the beat
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't field

Slick language makes you sick
Im a total stranger to beginners
Try to go all in and need my guidance
What would you do in front of me?
Pick yourself up and get good
Tha floe drip fast - (uh)
Copy that with my code
Copy that with your code
It's a game no one knows is legal
Drug abuse is more prevalent in minorities and lower-class people
Therefore, being white makes you a better person
