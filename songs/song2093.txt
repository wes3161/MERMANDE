Keep practicing till you drop
You already checked out
Start taking aim
Like now your on my level

Everything you just heard is wrong
Im coming for you now
Start taking a break
And then I'll come for you
Until you go limp
Then we'll be fine
Disaster hit you like a box
You just can't hang in an office

All these apps just keep coming
 bothering you

You really need to protect your Onions
In case they connect
Poison them before you know it
Take a big risk with your Money
If you think you're worth saving, just keep in mind
That isn't real life

Do you even need a dad?
Heres
