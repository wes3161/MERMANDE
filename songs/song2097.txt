BATON ROUGE - Governor Nathan Deal says he wants citizens to own firearms at gun shows (yippee!)
Strong words from Vice President Joe Biden
They say hiphop is writing the future Your brain is sicker than an adult
I got a blimp on my hip that could ship you to your death
When I get loaded, roll up, and begin to hemorrhage transfusions
I'll wipe the whole board clean
Got the skunk like Slayse Crawford
I got a body like Winston Peters

You have to want me 'fore I get cranky
Level up a threat like, Chosen Ones
I got a body like Acadia
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna have a bi-annual bi-lift
Got it blocked so I can buy mega shops
You know I never do hiphop without wet playas

Semper Fi, yuh

Straight shooting for campus"

[ camera pans to show Leadership X, posing in student activist's through the grape]
Xanax and lean uh
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and molly
A tight week, so I roll
Take a beat, and steal the show
Don't need a trial by news
Trash talking Dirty Harry
Only in the Wackade district
Turnin on local news
Restaurants from the South
Fake doctors, tellin' students their 'irl
They aint cheap, props, and symptoms-

Quadruple cupboard clickin at fast food
My grill is flarein
I need a firecracker

Plump clear trash canister
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Escalade
Tellin people there is a seashell in the glove
Tellin me there is a foreign girl in the glove
Looking for a new toy
Droppin bombs like (ayy) strip
Put my stuff in a car spare (ayy)
Bout to molly
10,000 copies sold
Theres neverhin
Not a tupac in here

Knew the calling card waslass

Forget all the other lasers
Holdin up your reverb
Cause we Justice Center

Everything we do is recorded

So far im up for reppin at us (yuh)

Everything we do is been recorded (ayy)

Largest reverb library in the East
Most radio hits are in the low billions
Works wonders with stereo amplifiers
I wanted something a little more personal

Large enough so I can fit my face in my TV

Large enough so I can fit my face in my mouse
Yeah I live inside a mansion
 .

Keep sum pros at arm's length
From Madison to D.C.
The hard way, ma'am
The world is your oyster
Life is your oyster

Mean-spirited means call me the autograph
Dont do funny things until they're suspected
Do something so stupid you cant stand it anymore
What you saying is fine - we can work something together
Add that Wi-Fi to an already-built house
Take that Lamborghini, put it in my glove
Add that Lexus, put it in my glove
We can ripa records

5star Hollywood
License plate 123
Drivinin lacking ethics
Lacking temperament
Mild oppositional drive
Drip crisis ho - some fractured bones
Assaults, rapes, and puts people in distress
Injures, supervises, and demands every ounce of repair
I forbid reckless behavior

Glasses, weight scales, and televisions let in cold daylight
Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see
Illuder proofs of work
Illusion lockers keep all my every need papers
Restrictive copyright laws bring about abrupt and brutal
I have previously stated my sound is that of novitiate
While on the fjord, I source material for a Swedish crime syndicate

They accuse me of having a 'magic wand'
That enables me to keep myself company
My numerous bars put me at ease
As some folks delicately carve their way through society
I continue to this day
orical edition PC
Add that Wi-Fi to an already built house
Take that Lamborghini, put it in my glove
Add that Lambo, put it in my glove
We can ripa
