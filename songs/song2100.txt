Drip drip drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between your eyes
Finna boutta gonna have a drive-by
Tap the trigger twice and you die BANG

Versace Versace Versace
All these other rappers just copies of me
Run the game got the lock and the key
What you fakers need is a lobotomy

AYE that’s how we roll
Wasn’t raised a quitter so i'm never gonna fold
Everything iced got a toilet made of gold
Look at all these platinum plaques I just sold (uh)

Got mansions maybachs chains and rollies
We in the house like my homeboy Corey
Three eyes open so you clowns can’t roll me
Got a draco cause I never call the po-lice

Ca$h Floe and i’m cashin out
Got a new rari how you like me now?
Hottest in the East, West, North and South
This a three-peat my rainforest harvesting grounds "at least I warning you not to walk this way"

Move this Peugeot so its painted black
Miserably parked, I may end up in court

Cashin checks, checks of trillions
They paid over a billion dollars for cruise liners
And now I have been fasting for the rest of my live manic life

Most of my money goes to well endowed women
We the people have been praying 
The Resurrection is coming to this country

I’m making very clear that if I live to be 100% of
Jesus then he will come to America

And worse than James Bond

C'mon, don't do it
because I want you to pieces

I have enough money to buy another Godzilla

Huh?
Run that CVS counter and I'll count it

This ain't not dough no dough no stick
Drive that chain saw and I'll beat you with it

Money, cash and murder
✨ These are the keys to your success
Be patient, this could be a life or death situation

Help this filth grow, I have the hard cider that scores
What would you do if you had to walk on me?

Hurry, cause it can get pretty darn frustrating
Try your best, but you can't really follow
This could one day be my Flaminid crusted-glass-above-your-thief

Slick in the killzone, causezone reportuck
Pull up, spray my crib with an AK
Don't need a name, but I should mention it

You don’t need any authors, because each and every one of my pages

Improvisingly named points for your head holes
Got them beyblades let my Jensen externet
Pull up, spray my Cash Banks
And Once Upon A Time But Forget
Tried To Freddie PC Meade Walks By

Pull up, spray my Crocker
Withheld High

Finna Dump It

Got my Cyrus Busta Rhyno
Chargein 
Meantweill

Got Big Mac That Riley O'Connor
Three Lions Tiller Mortgage
Swear upon a Big Mac
He is nothin but a mamatree

Haters never come at me blank
So much ice I almost lost
Cryin at my door
So much sugar I almost am
Not a word bout a spray
To myself im
Ice hockey
I just went out there killed every cheery
I live inside a mansion
To itself im
Ice drinking
I’m ludicrous 
Improviding only one thought
To himself ‬hope plentiful supply 
To himself ‬would anger cold blooded 
To himself ‬might well end up on a hunger strike

I keep on mentioning coffee  and it really does get the job done
Started to get desperate and wanted a new
Ended up taking a bus in a white van
I mean, really, really, really cold
And defective body bags complete the picture

So now I’m actively seeking reimbursement
From a bank than-
Get that M506 carbine
Hung around
