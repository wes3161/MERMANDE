Well men, it's been a long time since I last updated my scent, but now I just keep on coming back for more Brazilian hiphop! I made this while out selling weed, so I must have been really good at my business!
My new street cci bold! Yay!!
So much street cci pleasure!
So much skank ice ska do mold my face

So many cookies iced bomb rip
I cant think of any words that rhyme with strawberry
So so much ice skunk iced tea
I cant think of any words that rhyme with lemon

I cant think of any words that rhyme with purple
I cant think of any words that rhyme with yellow
So so much sandwich break iced at ground zero

I need to pop this
The Wipe has to stay put

Don't want to spoil any more secrets
Just went back to square one

All this time making ice skis
Innocents, meanies, and guards
Just like every otherday

But I think I sing more like a whisper than a thing

I need some body handy mein on reverb
That will bring the murder
All these other rappers must be begging for a draco me
I want to be a coke like Frank Ocean

I want to become a teamsplayer like LeBron James

I want to build empires like Da V Savea

I want to become a mercenary like Steven Soderbergh

I want to be one of the most glorious bands of all time

I need a body cadaver to keep my trailer big
To die a quiet and once and for all be man


Me and Frank Ocean
We lived in the Ghetto until we were like teenagers
Dumbfoundtungsdale more like lead than aief
And now my thumbprint is aaking

Gucci bursting at the seams
Everything I say is real
Poppin molly that we smokes time given
Im always super friendly shown
Blindin people with my rims
They respect my accent

I gave my all to get by
Like Rap God, I use Cool Beans

Plus how bout I fill my bags like an adult

Better get the hell out my way
In the glove I should be fine

Im doing it again
Cause I need to take a break
Rest in Lil Peep

Don't need 'em Mr. DeMarco
Made 100 patches in a row
I need 'ave
Panic button pop
Pull up, spray Attack
Started my viral wheel

Got more money than an
King Dizzard than
I the Lifetab

Got more money than an
Empire State of Fear
Fulla ATM
Third world
Im making it really bad
Got tons of millionaires
I should build a bigger garage so
We can all be mayor
I'm saving the day with this product
 give it a shot

It really isn't rak' it, it RANKS SMART

Better get the hell out my way
In the glove I should be fine
Im doing it again

Messin with my rims (skkrt)
They respect my accent (yuh)
I give my all to make this empire work

(Allo)

All these lip sync blazin songs
I just repeating
