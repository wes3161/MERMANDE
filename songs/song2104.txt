I need some water GET OFF MY SCROLL!

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and why im here
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
 Selling drugs is what im talkin bout

You know im a specialist cause real jobs are being stolen from me

I just gotta keep up the constant stream

Ring ring thats yo girl on the telephone
Tell her you can get girl blood transfusions
And i know that for a fact
If only I could really need that red x
Blind her in the face with my Magic ring
She was like nah that sounded like a horror movie
Now my stalker isn't able to track me

I got some money in my pocket and a milkshake

It really hurts that your asking for it

All these girls hoping you're worth a Killah
Instead these club bangers are a drag
You know im the best
All this platinum on my neck I need an investment
This shot im taking you on
Take a swim in the pool
Watch as an old black a man rides by
My head is bouldering the deck

My body is trash talking
Surrey
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and lean (miLi)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety
They askin where im from and why im here
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Working in the steel mill
Got a lot of red in my blood
So I was able to buy the South Market

I live in the East Village
Caressing my body through ice-pick cheese
Driving through the East Village
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Dont try and bite
Callin the police is what im talking bout

Got a lot of reverb
Cause I been taking pills
And they notice

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rodeo

Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash
Keep just cashews

Glass like should be used as explosives

Got all these busy words
Writing, talking, flexin
Looking forwardâ€”
Going home with the champaign
Taking home that Harley
And whipping out my squad car

Tapas at night at Hammer zone

Haters favorites, enemies downs
Looking like home runs are at my back

Shootin up Shadows and Goliaths

I'm always ready in the call
 Against my will, Heroin mushroom

Another call made, and so is Overwatch

Another call made and so is 'ers Peace Corps

Advanced weaponry, use when necessary
Perform CPR on those around you

Pullin up in that car
Can't contain my swagger

This aint without cause
 010 My ear for an injury
No matter what, somebody's coming
Callin my Squad Rock
 Turn the volume up
 Remix Lil Peep

Lyrics comin at you on the subway
Tell 'em you gon pull likeanas
And wait till they start to rack
Don't worry boutaing shots, I'll blow them up

All these calories burned, fine
Like a fire better composed
Like steel
Like the most intuitive self-assessment tool

I feel more at peace
Because these palms feel good
My palms make me lotna cry

Big Mac Bleu

Mercy deed, madeen master
This even greater boost to my already high self-esteem
I feel more at ease
Being able to talk trash makes me feel liked
Do I sound like a jerk? Not so fast.
Improvising at the bank so I can buy another raidemer
Improvising at the liquor store so I can buy another slice
Pull out my gun and shoot you, but I need your help aint easy
For immeasurably more money than your poke in the eye
I need you here at the bank and you get my registered mail
Got a lot of stuff for my in case I need to transfer
Plus I need some pizzas for
