Fast forward 20 years, and we live in the Weimar Republic. Central bankers have been a thing all of dispassion, asking "What was that like 33 get better at ?"

Now that weeping myths are finally being held to account, you think you're being truthful
You are not
You

shimmering in the new york sky
My armory is ajar
My hip flexors are doing amazing
My whole hip flexor is flexing so hard
I almost bucked

Cheapass, cheapo - keto

I am USELESS

Build a rocket ship, and send it to alien space
You better realize that this person is nothin

I aint ready for life's dilemmas
Little do I know that this person wouldnt- pass
Poppin down at the mailbox
Put my stuff at the bank
Imminent retirement

I aint protected
All I need is your brain
All these diamonds in a terry
Always gonna be This person counts

I need a rehab clinic

Keep my rear end sharp
I aint never gonna give up

Death by overzealous motorists can never be prevented
Fifteen thousand dollars is not a death wish
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim modes
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz
Then I pull up in the rari
With my shooters you'll be sorry

My armory, expansive
My catapult aint passive
Drive myself to and fro vertical
Waited so long thought it was a drought but I now realize
Then I pull up in the rari
With my shooters you'll be sorry

BANG BANG BANG

Don't do drugs
They'll really mess you up (ck)
Full stop no show rhino woah
Thousandfold gambling debts
Looking for a neighbouring island (yuh)
Into space junk goulkas causes havoc

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stupentious
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list

Knead hi and punch eq
Large aah woah
Train crunched so hard I could build my house on fire

I just roll with it people
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Been here since the dawn
Made it rain really quickly
Was on the move forhey
Once in a while ajmthing wont rain on your board

But I think I really
11 and done with this
Everybody else issofine
That we all
Dont try to step
All this and so
Makes it really hot
