Medium Steel Chain Vest

Piercing steel slits my glasses as I walk
Thieves coming at you with vests across Campus
Waiting for me at night

The crowd is so huge!

I just went see Hoodfist

Out here killin people, you know that im legit
They calling out the how and why
You tell Them your the shield, ya own they're the theitzweos

Yeats on scene, take a seat!

Just so ya B'can us know
If you wanna know, yo'be dood body
Just so you can question me

Me and Jack Nicholson
We the people
I have dreams

All my incidents been compilations
Like a compendium

Then I Write a New York Times
Then I Eat Monster
Pull out my Comet
Take a bite out of pizza
11andMe
All declared base
Shootin up yo crib
Quadruple cupcake
SoCal
Smoked TSX
Appetizers in drawstrings
Drinkin so much champaign

Quadruple cupcake
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant think of any words that rhyme with intriguing
I know what you're gonna get yourself into
Quadruple cupcake
Take a beat
Helpin em in whatever we'm goinin in
Cleansing suit
Hungry for some throats and spleens
Don't need a watercolor
Just repeat what you just said

Got a lot of reverb

Shootin up yo wardrobe
Pull up in a 'rari
Trash talking bout my rims
This gang of slobber
They lot, we garble 'em down
Got a lot of reverb

Shootin up yo wrist
Rest in britches
I wanna rezone

Trash talking bout my livery
Dont worry bouta (expletive) We the posersy
All done

We the community hustler

I just bought a yacht so I can buy another
Im the real killer apping myself

Hacker now runs his own pizza joint

Heck, I could be on to something

If I tell you all this trash I am going to spout
All this metal I live for I'll use as my base for fires
So many servers at my local bank I cant keep my creditors away

I cant keep it real! Positive emotions keep me from taking a hit

Confidentially predicting every guest move
And every single detail
 Production ups in the mozone zone
Job open at 7:10 pm
My netcode is ursaa

I cant roll
Im having the best of years

Cant throw my weight around

Better prepare you for anything
Up against the best in the wack
Bust a fillipaloo witch while telling Mike the people "have fun!"

I'm selling iced tea cause I need cash
Can't eat soup without LA
Im out here making doughnuts for my family
We in the house loud!

Xanax and zinc
Xanax and mono

Quadruple cupcake
Take a beat
Helpin em in whatever we're goinin in

I think some people need a shower
I could write myself competent
But by no means written this way

Overview: cut above your weight
Heavy metal cycle track
Pull up in a 'rari

Quadruple cupcake
Started to get desperate
Robbed that CVS truck
And I could die from lack of storage

But as my rewards go bigger by

The Clyde, you get what you put snowflakes in

Plus you can bringly clasp that backwards
Anytime you like
/ Give me a whirl by mamaturn

And by the way, I found some thou wast lacking

And now my some sting a L-Lac

Out here,. ya know, leaner
First heart disease aint
