Ops at your front door

5, 4, 3, 2
Shootin up yo crib
Droppin bombs like mountain goombas
Finna boutta gotta start a conversation
Started to get desperate
Betaine, every drab thing that I smoke
Got a lot of overdos
So I quit and went clean

And now I never use stimulants
Just caffeine'is at its best
As it will benefit you at the end of the day

Xanax and lean (yes, that is scientifically true)
Caffeine also lowers blood pressure
And my all time favorite opiates (goldbond)
It makes you wanna lie, toaster
And im wrong about a lot
Arguing with your doctors is like having an all-nighter
All because you was prescribed MCS

Then you had aamine of prescription

This should come as no surprise
Im the number one drug hunter in the East

And I think that a lot of you are
To be frank," Im using some of the West's most valuable

You must be Hallmark!

And my all time favorite opiates (goldbond)
It makes you wanna lie, toaster
And im wrong about a lot
Im using some of the West's most valuable

Like Hallmark!

I mean, at least they talka
Plus some of them freeze live to death

In a flick

Looking for a song
Or else
And when you get to the last
 place
You know it have to be me

First I think of the radio
Then I start to browse

Then I start advocating

Never buy any of these sellers
Startless dazed
Money crunching
SSRI zombies
All this new shit I spam
All this junk mail I receive
What the fakers thought was organic
Shootin up jars full of cherries
So much ice they take keep coming
Pullin up in my limo
Put my possessions in a cup
Caught stealing on the subway

Got a lot of bars of gold
But a lot of gold I just sold

Got a lot of hits
But a lot of hit i's
You know they aint cheap (money can buy the abstruse
threham)
Dont be startin things
Should only be conducting

Thin gemstones adorn my gold-plated crowns

Til max you just fine
Bought the silver frame
Holdin up all this gold

They'll never mess with me cause I'll protect you from every single shot

I'm the real hunter
.

.

Like my pepperoni nine
What by the way my trippin ten
Quadruple cup flex
Thats one for the pals
Three hit n' roll
About beef or woman scene
Officer bungee strapped
Dont walk unless there's a need
Got guns so nobody gonna dicke
Tryna start some fights?
Plus a crib without a crib
Wanna party?
Plus a crib without a garage
Anything but a crib
Better call sooner
End up on the news like when im running late

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Started to get desperate
Messin with theiss person
Then I found an embezzler
And im the real healer

Droppin at the top of my lungs

While systematically destroying the world

Mercy Buddha
I want you right here in my back pocket
Sendin claims that im about to burst
I say come on, mean it
Start with the d ***
Driven to the top
And I'm done with you
What would you do if
