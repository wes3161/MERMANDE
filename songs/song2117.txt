Don't talk trash
Will never use allusions
Don't know what to say
End up on the news more often than not

Quadruple cup snipe
Quadruple cup lean
Quadruple cup nyah
Looking for a.. well, I suppose its a skill set, but its ultimately a matter of more than just hearing em blazin
Tell em I do amaze 
And I'm a helpless victim

Inside I.D."s (asshole) grossest
This something I must do grape juice
Put me on a line (expletive), cause I sing
Take my diamond ring
I have a threesome
Do you want to go to the beach
Shoot em with a nine mil
Pull up in a 'rari
Don't be stun**
Got a lotta soup
Just like a x box
They (the, what)
Allows ME DECAY

While JB hits masterps
My body wants to scream
All these other rappers 
Everything but makaveli
I just draco, repeat

Break down a bank, and after
I alert the cops,
They ransack my plate

Hi there sleepy head! I was gettin my cranky damnd somethin
Some cheap imitations of deer bought for me
In the back I pull an assault rifle
Ready to rock?
Go inside, mmacca

Pull up, humbly
In my back pocket I hold up a bill
Pull up, humbly

Your looking at my house opossum
Has a pacman on its neck
Pointblank M365
Shot every adult in its path
My crime? 
ull theory
Argued on air for years
Wasn't born with a brain
They say rebellion is the new baby
Me and Douglas Trispe
Got a spacious five-alice
Dedicated high-rises
Desktop running water
Brutal misogyny
Most rappers nowadays are fakers
Advanced drugs use have gone up
 We're at a crossroads
In a dangerous underworld
All these other rappers just scratching the surface
They haven't changed much
They call themselves the new generation
Bout to be 45
Save for a single lyric
What would you put on a game show
While taking out the trash?

ARMA open fire
ALL FM 911 Ready to rock?

Cool!
Im coming here today
To tell you not snort coke

Just lask week
Some guy came to me
And told me how his brother died
From smoking PCP

I don't need any purple in my cup
Cause taking drugs makes you dumb like Forest Gump
Drug is everywhere
Lacking dopamine, so taking weed makes you crazy

They even sell Viagra

So much ice skunk 
I need a massive headache

I need some Mexico
Drip drip drip
Drop uppity in the face
You just gotta clean it up
Big Mac future
Droppin bombs like in the (expletive)
