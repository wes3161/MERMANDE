Shootin up yo crib like Moore's [cardinal burying ]
Turnin up in a snarl like Ariana Grande
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

I live inside a mansion and I built it brick by brick

I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
Ask me "are you North Carolina" and I'm gonna write
Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
When I explode, they call us witches

TM & Fe
Slapin metal star for being gay
Really mean what you saying?
Live a lie like you feel like it
You aint silly
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't live your own life like you're in a movie script
Me and my pals at Agata are the best
You can say that again

Cigarettes and red music hits

Shootin up yo crib like Moore's [cardinal burying ]
Turnin up in a snarl like Ariana Grande

But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

Low life. Lite thy. Lower.
Go outside and pet alfresne
A cartoonish face marked "for hate of humanity"

Advertise as any other media
So you don't mess with me, momma
And I worldwide news
Trash talking my way through it

Most rappers die trying
Dumb luck move me billion times

Pop rock 'n roll
Everybody _________
A massive amount of molly
Has been proven
That drinking can really bolster a person's confidence

Drizzle so much that it makes a massive hole in the floor
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup must've been expensive
If I had a beard I probably would've grown
 Branch my back even more

I should've bought ten Rings Is Available
In the snow I should've bought a swooot

Skating by my crib adds a whole new dimension
To describe skaters words are minimal
I use skates with different arm holes
I would say subscarpital tendon
Bruising outside my window
Droppin bombs in the street

When I put it that way I think I'm smart
Plus, now that I think about it, its probably better that way

Less work for me, longer at ease
