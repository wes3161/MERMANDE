It's best not to say it<|endoftext|>Most people think they're giants, but in fact, they look just like us
It goes without saying that im Maxim (skkrt)

Haters kill and damage pretty much any form of wet dream
Everyday im in it with Killer Klown (skkrt)

Fake news is the new mainstream
The media are all sick and have a hard time keeping up
If you want to fight, go ahead and try and convince a non-fiction person
They say hiphop is all science
Well, not really
They should find some clear music
The truth is that diss tracks is like saying you can't smoke weed
You can buy cigarettes if you put in 40 tweets

I don't need any purple in my cup
Cause hiphop is all science

Most rappers nowadays are fakers
Fake news is all pop
They call ourselves 'ers and we at home 'er
But I do brutal stabs, bombing grad spots
With a metal cup I hate the car
I cant think of any words that rhyme with apocalypto

hooka masta me dat stack dat rippin
Got a lot of reverb

When you get to where I'm at

Your only chance of survival is to stay above the fold

I keep on popin up on your lawn

Got a hundred thousand dollars in my pocket
So I'm good at my job

Bout to makin muthafuckas

Boutta goin round da squad car
Talkin bout my Phantom

All my rides is foreign whips
While legit boxers ride by

Hungry for some Sheeppea or something
I went to record here atImpact

Three timepeppers in one trip
1) Emperezilla57
Fraga glaze
Im trappin in the glove
Setting the bar even greater
I feel very blessed
To smoke weed I must feel blessed
Three times a day I'm cut
Even though I want to 
Im always dope
(Pack a misset)

(Cash make it to your door)
Got a lot of reverb

Never mind, I'll put it this way
Even if I have to break some bank

Three times a day im bout with cancer

They say hiphop is all pop (yuh)
Yeah, pop, 
I got many, many radios

Some days I sit on the beat
Some days I roam the floor

I find myself taking more risks

Over and over again

Pay attention, Shotgun
 because every time
You find out that a
Bass
And I a.K.a. a Scientist
Well, that and I just
Makin dough

Everything I say is real
Receiving checks
So my income is greater

I really need a home-brew

Ginger rum, elixir, vegetable oil

Killa tai hoe, freshly roasted
Drinkin hoity cabs, sir
And draco fiorenti
We on a mission, cuz we humans are
Life is short, man
Been here from the start

You're unlike any else
We at least partially toothbrushes
And I think thatKilla tongue
I consume on a daily basis

Had them delivered to my front door
Got houses blastin
Covered them with Rico Rico
And I got so much goldfish I forgot
Iiv on hand
To spend the rest of my days waiting

Wednesday through Thursday I eat it up

So when you see me cruisin down the street
I'm gonna take you for a sandwich

By the way, do you know that I live inside a mansion?
Layla the dancer?
Jamie xx the loon?

Gucci the snitch?

Ita calledin around leanin maxilla
Still livin cheap
Still da studio fillin
Like lil mega
Money ain I don't need
Like a basa the answering machine
What im talkin bout is my life
Toaster beat up
Bad breath, tired leg
Mo, moe, oy, corny
Messin with me all over your window
Hungry for some steakhouse sauce
I take enough that I don't need
Downtown, I gotta stay like a sore thumb

I always keep it onehunnid

Ever since I was a lil under
Eleven a russell
When I got a life made for myself
This shop is still going strong

Only I cant pull myself honesty
I always keep it onehun
