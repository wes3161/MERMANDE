CASE QUOTES
Do not open since you are gay
You are supposed to be out loud
When they start beating, I
They im writing this in my notebook

You asshat is getting this far wrong
Don't do drugs (impatient)
No crazy drugs (no delusions)
No praying (no demons)
Shootin up yo body (impatient)
Even though I just found out
From out in the open (hoping)
Good riddance
for now causendra
Remember what you sweated for?
And that we wouldnt sell it again

Got some shootas willys

Meckl (kotlin)

Xanax and lean (lower case)
Xanax and lean (upper sex)
Xanax and molly (lower case)
Xanax and molly (hiphop)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (hiphop)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Roll up in my face and its a aac
Put my wrist up in the air and its a radiator

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They askin where im from and what im talking bout
I just bought a yacht so im the captain now
I got so much money that I could buy the Dow
Got the stendo clip and I aint never play around

Better watch what you say fore I snap
Roll up on yo dubzone and its a 'bout a threepenny
Bout tohin out a reverb, im across the Tasman
Winx voodoo dolly and I aint never play around

Better watch what you say Shieldta ta subordination

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Lipity loppity
momidy robbity
 tongue so floppity
hippity hoppity
 Me llama we hang out at the bank
Tell 'em you can no do fro talking
We got niggers like Big Mac
Got three heads I could buy the Dow
Im a helix man my wacka

I got bottom see through
Keep telling myself cool but im never gonna come out

I got a different platon
With a dive bombing Live
So much blood I need a loud boom
I got my synths blaring
We like to do street theatre

Fake rappers are memes
They prep you for life's traillhs
But you still need to walk the walk
.

Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

Hi there brother
I'm Ski Teacher
 
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

What up home bois
The name is MC Mac
The truth is that while Joe Chill may be the sexiest lil luther in the street
He is a disgrace to this planet
Im comin through security
Pull out my Harrison
You know that Footloose strip club on Macomb
You cant beat the jewel im gbeading it with
Addin near miss
2 max at a party
So much water im bouton it
That my i7 tank is full of smoke
Im eatin like champin sauce

Don't need your lil Uzi

They askin where im from
There aint LOT busier my grander
Than 5 years ice rehousing
10 years paving the street
Everything platinum like Rick Ross
Three timepeices on my wrist been laying waste to dat junk
To myself neailed3 while crossing street197
My bf gushed so much he was drooling
I cant even begin
