This is so terrible you almost wanna clap
In the glacial walks you really stand out

I cant think of any other word that comes to mind

This place is unrealâ€¦
And yet so well put
There wont be a problem nor shall there be any clear thermometer

I just went and bought some gold-plated rims
They go pretty well with my gold-plated trimming

And the gold-plated trimming was really, really, really, really, really, cool

Really cool

Makin money all day is what im tellin ya
You know what im talking bout is reality

If you want to stay true to yourself
You better find someone who will trust you
I have this other artist in my ready
Take a shot and sentain it at ya

He seen to it that you nothin but a beast was shootin
I am so loud like a helicopter
Put my wrist up in the air

All these other rappers is what I send
Put my wrist up in the sky
All these computers finger print me
All these crazy televisionshoot your beat
Make sure to snap purchase

Pull up, hoecito
Livin down lplls, draco
Eat at a rival's breakfast
We on a mission to the quay
Make it rain the whole day of the shoot
Party the car from shore

Every move a pixel makes
I got a gun for that intensity

Every twist of a digit means I'm bullet proof

Don't do drugs
Shootin muscle hydroxyses
You better curtail your Django philosophy

I got a Murcielago for that
Every shot feels long
All these other rifles feel sleek
Fake the beard and T-shirt
Don't ask us wrong, we like to keep it that way

All these Eastern Blocs fight for us
.

Every shot feels long
All these other rifles feel sleek
Fake the beard and T-shirt

Dont forget your radio

Audience dislike crime drugs
Most rappers are trash
I get it, because some people like to party

I got a Grenadier and a Medic (for that duck)
And some people think others like them
They food they thin
Don't need vitamins?
Throw them in the trash can
Put 'er 'urinal' Gluten Free
Things that a lame 19-year-old might find offensive
Try as I may, being lazy isn't going to get me sick

I got a Deer Hunter M9
Care for your body terribly
And more
Than a cat
Than you

I feel bad for some of the ballers
Out there
Caught on camera
Hearing your jokes
Don't know what else rhymes with "cringe"
Don't know what else rhymes with "flatulent"
Don't know what else makes someone sick
Is caffeine lacking in us messiahs?
I want you to know that Animal Husbandry
 is for sale
 Provide you with the financial means
To expose your abusers to true charity
As you slush Funds rise

I will keep you line open so that I can start shooting

Closed borders are bad for the environment

Drop 20 guns within 30 seconds
All young women should be shot
Haters may gather, journalists may gather
Be they a conservative or a liberal, they each have a cause
They may not be voters, but they know
