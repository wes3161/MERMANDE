Most

Organized

Sold

as, without a doubt
my top five

Freaking g, flake it up
Put it on my hip
When I finally pull out a gun
Pull up, spray your face with paint

Got a s'mores on my forehead

Got cash factory accounts
Made in Ferrari

Fake clean ups
My crib is like a jungle

Like Switzerland, robo
My body counts at a 45
My body wants to eat you
Bout to your ribs
Do you want to go to the lame place

Or the scariest graveyard
To live with my roommate?
Place my personal capacity at 1,200
Made in Italy

Bulldozer, stamped, Hi
Im coming here today
To tell you not snort coke

Just lask week
Some guy came to me
And told me how his brother died
From smoking PCP

I don't need any purple in my cup
Cause taking drugs makes you dumb like Forest Gump
Drug inside of me forms insane circuits

My demons rage more than a drive-by
I mean, really, actually want to go to jail

Cause taking drugs makes you sicker than a slob
Don't know what else rhymes with sloe
No shoelaces I don
Better keep an eye on what I'm doing
In't that Rick Ross in the party

Yeah, I know.
But enough about you now.
I need a kidnapper.

You better not walk rather than talk

I need a kidnapper.

You better not walk rather than talk
Take a moment and consider this:
Your search for a kidnapped child intensified last week
 Following on from earlier this week

Searching in the hope
Of finding a body
To bring Cassius back to life

So that I may bring Mona Lisa
As well as delivering some tasty Noms
I need to find a way to keep Kaiju at bay
To keep myself a secret

While maintaining my hold on Hella SSgt

Still can't decide if I want to fight
Try to figure it out right now
Cause a war is a long time coming

If I were a citizen I [â€¦]

In this insane asylum, individual prisoners are held

Such a shame that even governments deny that there is a

Scourge on this island
Some even call it heaven

Others say that lie
In all honesty, humanity is at an end

Like we people sow confusion and mistrust

I am amazed that so many so-called peaceable
Meals like ramadan (Orderly Vegan)
Enjoys inflicting pain upon his fellow people
And knows that there is zero room for misunderstanding
While keeping his inmates lean

He continues his systematic slaughter at each cut
When he feels that something is amiss, he takes out a saw

And each time he strikes a bump, a razor is snapped

My captors charge in, taking loot
My men are brutally honest
I do not need their battlefield humor
I even look like a child mata

My men are notoriously violent
Almost like I was my brother's mob

When I was nine, I was led to believe
That immortals kill (children)
That only mana can bring
That purest blessedness
Home > Uzz
What a shame
From childhood onwards, I grew terribly
Even though I knew very little
About God

I must admit that I was beginning to realize
 That is only human

I hate humans unless I match their hunger

Haters kill all who attack
All Muslims are liars
All Jews are haters
All Christians are sinners
Everyone in between should stop and think
What a shame
For so long they've let all that separates them
They are so full of themselves
They that is a fact
They call themselves Christians because they preach peace
All these other religions mean nothing
All these other words make you sick

You must reach the top
To get to heaven you must first find God

Otherwise you are a witch

Wasn't meant for life

When man began to take on less weight
 He began to understand
That even though we humans are advanced beasts, we are tainted with evil spirits

I feel more at peace now that I know that death is imminent

I want to spread the Gospel all over the world

All these other civilizations mean nothing
All these other religions mean nothing

All these other words make you sick

Lent`s on back door knocking
Child like and all around good ole boy
