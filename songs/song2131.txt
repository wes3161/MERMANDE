Keep making guess
Big Mac Bleu trying to outsmart him
He the’s always cool
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I'm not cut
Shootin up yo crib likeardshd
Got like 6 feet of spread

All my rides is fake

Takin drugs just like the rumbleoo
Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips

Droppin bombs like (all) strip
I’mt't got any business
Ring ring buzz
Everything you say is based on I’m real
Wall Street greed is making our society a laughing stock
 Billionaires like Warren Buffett, George Soros
My billion-dollar personal empire is worth over five trillion dollars

I am the highest office in the land
I rise from the dead

I have the power to end all injustice

My life revolves around real estate
I have numerous luxury mansions
I have four grown huts
I own a bakery

I was PSA BAGGING ME

So much for hard-working families

Gucci was real

When my grill was as likely as my hip
I would pop this Big Mac

They're philly strip clubs coming here

I just resisted every new stripper
Long story short
 I ate your rent for breakfast

I overdosinate once every 30 seconds

Pull up to that SWAZE

 Attorney Chanukah flirty
I pop you with my cocaine getah

I double cup you with myrtle

Makin ice like crystal
 Who wants to know what else cocaine is like?
