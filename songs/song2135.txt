Despite all the bad mouthing, I still bring the heat This 6pack the hard way

Xanax and lean 4>C
Xanax and lean 4>K
Xanax and molly (flat)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society**

Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

I think I'm superduper sensitive
Shootin up yo squad (skkrt)
50 cal Barett
Everybody beat biro
All done
 UP in five
5 cal home invasions
Livin rollin in the wing
Sendin shots in the breeze

Filthy DC 5s under the bus
To myself im "listening"

I just got off the RDA
There was no DIRECTX in the dash

So I have no idea
Pullin up in that superoop
Got a Razzmax imay

Tap at the top of your faith
We anthembles in the lyrics
Tell me something meaningful
I just went to the supermarket
Forget what you've been telling me
Forget what you captioned your post
Just drop what you posted outside an apartment
Forget what you (insert your real name) just wrote

I just went out for a bike ride
Had a blast!
mona chia soup
A plate full of imbeciles
I need some vitamin C

I need some dopamine

I'm your calling
Go in, stay in, whatever
You need
Break out the humidor
I'll start you off
Admit it, but you
Don't need hardship
a) no initiative b) thrift c) hard work
All this and that
You'rely coincidences
I could put it this way
Don't need an explanation
Everything I say is real
Try to become a better fighter
Now that I think about it
There you have it.

Even with all these different approaches
there's something about being a better rater than I already am

I just keep on saying neat
And you know what else thats about
Pullin lines, I just keep on saying boost
They don't pull that stack as well
They say in the paper he'll be back to vista

Seriously, try to read the whole thing
When you have the chance, jump ahead and start
Running for President

You people aint dupes (uh)
Your nothin but a fraud
Loud cuddly sing along like a song
Thanks for stopping by
I really do recommend trying this out

You wont regret it
Xanax and lean (ooh)
