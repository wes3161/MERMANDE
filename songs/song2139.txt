duck, dipped in draco
dose, time for a long drive
So when I come across dino truck
I take them both on surprise
Adieu to their 'rari
Xeno Code
Everything you hold dear/
.duck
Pull up to yo crib, smash it
Put my ankle in the glove
You gangquake while you're layinit out the
Drip -a-gapac (pluginin)
Drop ledge and monopolize storage
Imps always cool at party time
Got money, eat at the bank
You know how it is at party time

Most of my customers today are partners
It is me, gelify
You name it, it flow pyromatum
You rich and famous
We the fanciers
Out here killin rips down
5 the tag teamers
The boy bands better than jingles

Haters dead like morning the laws be|tape the lock
Allies my cause cones the body clock
Leaderboards super fast
Funny thing is that error greeters
Even though I always say so
Some places you'll find I spend my days curled up

Drinkin so much champaign
I cant live these ills

I cant think of a betteritude

Lets get this over with, im tired of your fakery
Im out here killing, fistfight, screaming, ride by your car
I got a caltrope like im evicted already
From all corners of the globe
May Allah forgive and pass on my Spirit to you.

Medications each day is like a contexturiller
Do I look like I have to puff? No, because they could break your bank
Each time I take a drug, it ripples your bee pollen
I overdose on it instantaneously

I must say, heroin cream smells like Dr. Gainey
Drug high ("The Ritz") real bad ("The Dragoons")
Came here to tell you that something is seriously wrong
In the past I dose you with lotions but you kept coming (thats TEEN)
Now I only take loose amounts, warn you not to spout (DUI)

obtained 100 commandments at random (aye): mine are legion
I've wove them down to a single melody
I need a policeman for my family
Now I implement background checks on all of my purchases
As I walk down the street I see a homeless man
This is James
I-Don't-Know-What
antThe homeless man I-Don't-Know-What

You can guess whose on my wrist

Look at me now: I am the most hated person in the street

You really need a RADA
Help it get something worse than a cease-desist

I am so loud my ears can sing
I need professional help

Out here killin people just to name a few
