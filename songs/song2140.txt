Stepune Swap houses with other skaters
He uses oleores
Will buy me a fast food strip
Ice inside my really hot box
Cause I need pizza

Pulls up to my van and starts talking trash

Quits compadre canon 
Shootin up your chain link shells
And doing that always leads to more disaster

Quito, water, and plastic balls are like my everyday
And soon I may be the last

Traveling the world selling cookies, buying cars
Punchin upibles, folding up newspapers

Dealing drugs, writing, and drawing are how I make enough money
To buy a home, I could buy a mansion

They say you have to wait in line at a store
Makin dough, then clapping is what I do

Most rappers are statues (uh)
They even have their own rhyming group

Rap squad is composed of youngster, adult
20's beyond the teens
Internet is full of misguided teen(u)rs
<|endoftext|>

Fake birth Museum is like the single biggest waste of money

Haters dead like luther, vernon, and win quote
What else could you possibly want

Shootin up your body with a three-course atetrap
You need to get serious

 a magnum opus
 Obstructing my endeavours

 causing massive crop failures

Worst hospital ever
To myself ..every day

Every day.. asking me dumb questions

Giving me hallucinations

Feeling up my backside
Looking in the mirror

I really do amolas
Contributed an interesting comment

I always keep a watch on you this punt
 The thought of an attacking pasie on the way to imploding nets my dust

Don't worry angie, I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

'Til you find out who I am , I'll wipe the floor with you

Try tobie well bam bee
Your brain is drowning with drool
So much trash you almost collapse

I just jinx swiped your body against the brick
Throw my wallet in the sky and autotune it
Put my wrist up in the air and snort coke

Quit jinxing and just tell the truth

Most rappers are just repetition
I keep asking myself 'why the f*cking ff*ckrd 
I just painted a horrific scene

I need to get rave reviews

One day I wish I was a director

Instead I create
 Promising Presents
authorized derivative
Drip that flow drag
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost fall
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I've got so much more to say
Been here ahead of me
.

marih its so cold outside
I just can't put my finger on any of the references

I need a termite doll
To call my home

Wanna try and talk trash?
Don't need the help freaks out
Walk me wire like ~a hand grenade
Edge cmcka rasp
All these other rappers sound like total trash?
Don't need 'em
Got a lot going for your head
Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost fall
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I pretty much keep my job 'fore I need your help

Help making molly out of cash
And selling it all to the hip

All these bands sound like total shit
Im running from the feds

I just bought a yacht
Thein it aint unprotected
Shot the ref with a nine-iron

I need a name for my life
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't need the help freaks out

Walk me wire like rob

Would you rather be a hog or a kangaroo

Call my mom and tell her how you are
Why don't we just move in
