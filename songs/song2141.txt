Lets say I have a hard time transferring words between people
And that is why I are a haters person
So much hate in the name of humanity
All these different countries you live in (eating, sleep, and buying)
Yeah I wash my food (I call this choice mindful )
 I take what I take

Everyday that makes me feel better

I must not get overexcited

Everyday that makes me feel good

When I should be screaming at the top of my lungs
I should be concentrating on something

The only thing keeping me from concentrating on what is at the bottom of my lungs

Everyday because I keep making fool's-dads of myself

I must not be this way around my house

Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see
