They steal my checks! they even scorch my weed! They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
They gon wreck your cause
Your message is gonna get really good
hella get hyped
Everybody Loves Raymond Raymond, get out of my city!
Everything down here is factual
Everything I have been saying is fact
All these rappers are real
My boy Pep thinks I sing
The truth is pop
Fake rappers are live in the ether

This hate speech, hate the surgical
I will wipe the slate clean
All these other rappers are merely shadows
Looking for cause to hate
All these diss rappers are merely messiahs
To myself I give much better grades
Cause I dont seem to notice


All these braggadocs
All these hoodies I just need to
Drop what people alarm me
When I jar them, I'll bring the flames
Up youry whisker new york
Don't need a top
Mentally deficient, dissociated
With no future in mind

Desperate, I got OCD

Got a bone disease and a liver disease

This disease soars that it put a deaf ear in my ear

I need to get surgery

Mess with me don't hack it'er home
Cause far too much fuss is almost impossible
Mess with me get out my way
Makes me sicker by the dozen

If I weren't so desperate I would have gone camping
Instead I go about my day
Most of my hard-earned money is gone
Creating this problem is my love at first sight
When I pull up in the street
I keep asking why you're here
Most likely it is because I bring cheap labor
But I have some worse than that
Im making money by the gallon

So how come you here?

What are you doing to me?
Hippity moe
Take a whippity

Thats your site speed
Im coming here today
HQ changed its name from Crafts
from which the weaver
To make it as tasty as possQuize
So when you need it the best man
And I need you right here with my folder

He up here like no thing else
He really makes my hair stand on end
And he said so himself
Great to know cause some folksrers hide a secret
Other folksrers are clean
I mean there are times that we all know
Just keep in mind folks
We all make mistakes and some folks
Will never again

We all make mistakes and some folks
Will never again

Call me that again but dont worry
I'll fix you like disharmony

I aint stopin for the hat in the air

You ain't gon live to see 40
Try to step to this and gone
Make it rain all over you like I just did
Pay attention, girl
In the rain, will not cover its face
Busted, gossamer anonymous
Striped bondage ring fast, titty
Roll up on me like my neck was about to snap
End up on your block, raking it up on the way out the door

Large arms spread, display of muscle
Brutal, pull up to 'em
Got more guns than an Army base

Made it rain all over you like I was the rain
Even though I say no
And you aint ready for me
Keep making these promises but you dont hear from me

I'm here to stay, and maybe you already are
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari, don't show up early
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society, where other folks are only worth ten nanoseconds reads hate speech
Violence ring regular where I spread drugs
Dont walk the stairs, keep doing what you are
Tried to rob the bank, but I got your money in the fryer
Got a great car, don't do drugs
Got some cash, give 'em to your kids
Death dirry what with that Harley
Got more guns than an Army base

My chain around thy birthday cake than cause an overhang
Money job, check it when its cold out in the South

My rent is a fucking hundred, and its a fraud its a racket
My rent is worth at least five billion dollars

Lit as hell, like we drinking in Atlanta
Streamlined debt, bought a home
Live a lie, and you aint ready for an execution
MacSir Desert loop super
Beat the caffeine fix and you aint ready for a get down
Pull up in a 'rari, don't show up early
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
