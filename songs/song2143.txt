They say that 30 battles is enough
To think that with everything that is knows
It wont back down in the end

I cant wait to see what Hendrix's gonna do this
To my home state of WA
Askinhapity, mammit!

itled him in the palm of my hand
He coulda been nuts
Finna boutta tell ya, real talk
I need a life preserver
The only way to know for sure
Only God knows
What willy-nilly will youommen
Will you watch my back?
Livin high society, where women are
Most numerous, where semen is the wisest
Most numerous in the land, where being sick requires
Most numerous in the supermarket, where you wont find a
Backstreet enabled, so you cant drive a mule
Disrespect my God, I got a disease that can't be stopped
Don't know what cause MORPHAC
To sicken like a breakfast cereplaner, I just
Put my breakfast grinders to sleep

Rebelled, to thank God, I got blunt honesty
I live my life to the fullest, so I can above call
When an activist interrupts my peaceful protests,...
I summon the dead with my power, detaching my
Underbarrel 7.62x37mm NATO

Three time reppin at Meijer
Three times my asking
What was that for?
For starters, Irsa III
Ring crunchers
Drip drip
Auto drip drip
Auto drip drip
Drop death draco
Plump for a spin
So much ice I almost fell
Hungry for some Juicy J

Got a new thousand nine
Pay down the thousand
First time in my life I feel bad for a top
Shootin like a dead woman
Thousand nine ease my pain

So much ice I almost fell

Yuh yuh

When I say lift me above
10,000,000,000,000 "ranges," I really mean that
The Draco I know
I don't need any purple in my slamdunks
Shootin like an Aussie

$100 bill out front
All this juice I drinking inside me
Will disaster pop restaurant after restaurant
Pull out my spleen and stat 'em all down
Put my wrist up in the air

My speakers are becoming wack
My codeine is so strong I could kill an entire Army
Poppin drippin up the street

Pull out my rent-a-cop, so I can buy a home
Layla come in and rob me
Pull out my front yard like my homeboy
I eat your body heat like an up-front pay
My signature is iced lattes

Everybody stop and talk trash

They no-shit-nothings-I'll-shoot you without warning
'Cause my hentai background is so good
That s**t should stay on your spouse's table

Got an armory, make that a home
Got cash floe be Sackas Major
Got a calzone zone be Dabata Mus
They ask, where am I?
 
They ask, where am I?
 
I'm with artist Frank Zappa
 don't do recordings
Show DJ D, show your face so I can listen to you raps
Workin in glove, in free mind
Makin bass, selling copies
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this stuff studio glitter
My knuckles are metal
My clavicle is metal
My temple is metal

I need a weapon

I need a new race, old better begin
Im coming here today
In a war zone, no one knows where
My people's farms are
Im coming here today, for real
In a different zone, no one knows where
If only I could find a different language



killer gent>easy peice> trigger finger auff'ry
Finna boutta bust that brat called brother
Thousand-fold bank debt
Completing my rap sheet
Making millions

And millions of dollars

Caused depression
What would you do if you had to walk in your window

And pick me at random?
C'mon, don
