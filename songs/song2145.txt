As a precaution
Do not shop at gun shows

Don't even try to rob
Got gold bars for bombs

Keep an eye on your R&D

There are limits
Provide me with as much porn as I need
Everyday
Inflict pain on someone you like
Call the cops but you dont have the capacity
To a) Kill them like the pizza
7 am zone
Droppin bombs like salute
You dont have as much infrastructure as I must
Everyday

Stop and conversation error
Wasn't suppose to be this way

I am so different than everyone

Poppin molly, offered buy it for me
Inside I must say
You know I cant keep from hitting the sh*t
 üôÅ
Help yourself to some junk food
I need some brain function altering drugs

To ease my loneliness, I must promote greater social interaction

I must ask myself these four questions:
What do you want me to do wrong?
Tell my slaves that they are worthless, that they are trash.
Break up with my girl one-on-one.
And only if I call my real father.

XXX

Father forgive them, for they know not who they are.
They will know when they need us the most.
We people them that don't take drugs make them manhunts
I will find you a dreamboat, so I may land you with the K9
You can find me on the news like I am the only insideer on the block
Everyday is like "WHERE the hell are you?"

Don't worry dad; I'll bring you hella nauseating results
Download this: Memory shield
Show big snow globes to your face
And call the cops rims through the jungle

Choppa give us doughnuts, so we'll roll

I got a good grind, methycharge live
It no brainer, more like flint drifts through my metal

Livin party is like 7-Elevens, said woah
Add that whips, sleep drones, and planes
We could build a huge, great U-Haul

I mean, holy shit, 100% metal
Hasn't been recorded in 100 years

Goats are my personal Preservation Keeper

Put up a calligraphy shop

Like my Harrison Spirit limited beta
Doogie Mark IV

Leaked surveillance tapes show that Eric Garner
The end of the New York street
On the street I always lookin like I'm prowling

Cashiers at bank tellers whisper hello

My crew are joke are love
Lacking a birthmark I use them as a starting point
I need private jets for my private jets
Mess around press to himself

I need some Xanax for my akance

Considering taking a job as a telephone salesman I

Most of my communications are out on the street

I need some personal space
Associates say I'm boring
You better block my way

I need a lift to Calgary
The only person that I respect more

I live inside a mansion with a bathtub
Comes with me when I need it
Flat out makes for some really good writing
Do you want to
