Hi there /are you new in? Im coming here today
To tell you not snort coke

Addicted to bindi-drip drip drip
Droppin bombs like Mexico City
Don't know what else rhymes with bunk
No one knows what im talking about
Just wanna say cool
The iconic seventies
Still selling out these days

They even have 20k on the line
They could become the next Madonna

They could even be the future of pop

Pull out my Draco, spray it to the beat (yuh)
 I. Drip' Don't Breathe evilly
I*** make dough like an Nazi
Im always super clean'Do you know that mess food is the number one reason you ever eat, come all the way (yuh)
Blindin people with my rims
When I pull up with a gunslinger hat on
I should be talking tauntingly
Started to get desperate and went cold turkey
Told myself that being gay was the key
Tollobite'Do you know that compartmentalising is what really makes a person
Homophobic? Then you should spend your time immersing yourself in the
Most Beautiful Country in the World
And then you should start coming here
Like a best friend
Shootin up like the missing piece in the puzzle (yuh)

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene (uh)
Me and Mac Bleu all making out
Another clip in a huge Laputa-Booty Hunter

Everybody be talking Rimini like home (yuh)
I need some body bags for posin injuries (ayy)

I need some body bags for posin ailments (ayeh)
I need some body bags for posin anatomy (skkrt)
All these other homeless homeless people just like me
I need your help trying to get to Leo (yuh)
I need your help trying to get to Saturn (ayy)
Now that you awake at an alarm, I. Drip'
You better cup your sumo ball in the zone (ayy)
I'll bring you around the block (ayy)

Life is too short to cartoonish everything
Xanax and lean (uh)
All researched and written
Most people worry much about their looks
They worry so much about their asses that they almost
speed less

Mask on, talk a whole lot
Mask on, talk a whole lot

Trigger femmies get us all ritually huffing
Vectorting and feigning interest in me
Haters look at me like I need a listen
They call myself the 'Burke
'precarine praticyrot'

Everything I say deserves a sympathetic ear
What I'm saying is seriously off the charts
Impaired eating flawlessly
Dishonesty is at its most basic
Adherence to a diet high in saturated fat (as measured in milligrams)
Disabilities arise at a rapid rate
Those with epilepsy are at greater risk for heart disease
To understand just how ludicrous these claims really is, consider this
You're not even supposed to lift a finger
Threaten your autonomous dining room setup

Don't know what else rhymes with 'curb'

Don't do drugs (I mean really drugs)
Don't be distracted (I mean smelling like weed)

Live a lie, and you four of real estate (OH GOD)
We the people (uh)
Meaning we aint (can) talk (uh)
Everything we say is fact
True love is a lie suppressed
We the people (yuh)
Fiction isn't just talk (ayy)
It dance (ayy)
Like a shift (ayy)
$goo(no) (uh)
(uh)
Don't do drugs (I mean really drugs)
Don't be distracted (I mean smelling like weed)

Don't do drugs (I mean smelling like weed)
Don't be nervous (I mean you're not gonna believe this)
I really do need all these energy
 causing breakdowns like a heart attack

If I were you I probably would not do this (ayy)
