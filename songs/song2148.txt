FIGHTRY Oh thats so hard im talking gold

Step inside my purse
Add that outstanding reppin reppin
Finna boutta leave it at this position
Disrespect my permission
Pull up in a 'rari
Take a beat, say hello
Come inside my empty mamatail
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies, each day of the week (gang gang)
Poppin molly, you know i never sleep (no i dont)
Got money, money money money (large cash)
Straight shooters, you know we we aint funny (kevin hart)
Your girl need vitamins, i give her sunny d (nutrients)
She aint your girl, if she coming home with me (large cash)
Number 1, hottest in the street (heatwave)
Lit as hell, like we drinking gasoline (exxon)
Pull out my Draco, spray it to the beat (gang gang)
I’m always cool, but I still bring the heat (goldbond)
200 thou, for that Actavis (codeine)
I am so loud, like an activist (large cash)

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin bread, makin dough like Papa John's

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between your eyes
Finna boutta gonna have a drive-by
Tap the trigger twice and you die BANG

Versace Versace Versace
All these other rappers just copies of me
Run the game got the lock and the key
What you fakers need is a lobotomy

AYE that’s how we roll
Wasn’t raised a quitter so i'm never gonna fold
Everything iced to mind
Got a beyblades let it lapse
Don’t listen to loud music (I smoke)
Don’t eat vegan (oize works wonders)
I’m not even joking when I say eat my weight (or something)

Got a life preserver doggie style (yuh)
Got aating brain (yuh)
My smokers clique (yuh)
While coke is a sore loser (no wonder im not a guy)
Yuh-leeity corpuscle longle’rd
Got bank accounts all over him (yuh)
Got ailing lungs (uh)
Lacking the callingilty biological makeup
I’m out here making dough, plopping down (uh)
Hold up, that isn’t straight 
Hey there kids! I have some really cool stuff in my back yard
 Coming soon to you
Im 3 the hard way
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don’t listen to loud music (I smoke)
Don’t believe me when I say I am really good at hiding from you
From my almost impossible (uh) dreams
Maybe you guys are ill-informed
Tell me, something fishy is telling
Nothing is cheap
Can't even buy ice-cold juice

I need a high-performance liquid (yuh)

Now what?
Try to think critically
What would you do if you found out that I didn’t exist 
Don’t try to use scare tactics
Tell me, something really terrifying is lurking in the depths

I need to talk to somebody

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin bread, makin dough like Papa John's

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
