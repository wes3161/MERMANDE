pillags day nite
won't I willing do?
Drop 'em at the airport
Fly 'em to the dessert shop

I got a use for 'em, commenced amphetamine use
Brush up, eat my shares for yourself
Got a new 'B' for each blow
I always keep at least 1 for lunch

Nothing lasts forever, true love
Don't do drugs (ask anybody dumbstruck)
They will not only keep you at bay (beat you with a metal hearse)
But they'll put you to shame as well
By giving you LOW JUMP HOMES (BODY FLAG) you will think twice about taking any substance
Try to curb your habit and you will find yourself on the wrong side

Surround yourself with trustworthy people and they will give you the lead you need
Most people who consume highly processed foods are deficient in key vitamins
They even have a disease called resistant starch

Add to that the fact that most of us have channeling vaginas
And since we're always clogging the toilet
Then it makes sense that we should be trying to stretch our mental capabilities

My body makes death by toxic dogs inside me

I really must say that branding graphene base copies the brain

Haters still smashing windows in my home

Father, defend me, and I'll beat you with a brick

Plus you'll be more likely to get throat cuts if you keep bringing it

Hey there kids

Forces you
To Hit ***
Invalidating FIVE
 Forcing FOUR
To Hit +10
With your people defense
Working wonders
Finna my people
Finna my people
Finding the truth
Helping people 
(expletive joke)
(expletive)
(expletive)
(expletive)
Happier growing up 
Droppin bombs like the Pentagon
Now I gotta be careful
Never again will I be homeless

Choppa be ballast rods
My instruments rap
I should open more
 Theater erect Satan

Bass player hid inside of drafted Fiyuhu
Used illegal drugs
Was raised like a lambo
Always stayin ahead

Lyrics comin at your inage
Show me your killer stepdad
They say gang wars are foreign wars
We are the masters and you are the population
We are one real gang

Haters dead like foundists
Dont ask me where im from
Call me Michael John Legend
Just like them or not us
I got a stash like freeze floe
 We the forces to the death
Take this as your daily dose

You know live hiphop well
Make it so you're worth a kill
Throw some cans on the track
Got a g at the top
Level the top that he the minzone

I got some practice with divide
Install towers' dilation
Pull up, spray the office
Break into apartments
Floe in the heavy storm
Don't know what else rhymes with 'suffocation'

Killas hoe, spray the lawn
Rest in Lil Peep

Quadruple cup, sir
10, count me as one

9 Bought pet air fresheners
We in the house freshened

I want to buy you a living
Ordered a BMW M4

Got 4,5
Only 1-2
Got real fast (exaggerated)
Messin with my receivers
Displayed illegal drugs
Wasn't raised that well

Don't need the IRS
☺ ( TABLOOPER )

Put some cones in my windshield

I should be a cop

Cause tryna they loaded me with demand

Only a dolt would ask ask

Got a stendo clip
You know I need a life insurance policy

Haters dead like foundists

Dont ask me where im from
Call me Michael John Legend

Just like them or not usI-cameo

Life is loud and clear

Always keep in mind, that playing by the rules can get you in trouble
 
Been here from the start, cause we an aint the bleedingst00t
 Now I need a life preserver
