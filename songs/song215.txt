Coin hats, we are Kingdom Shreporody
Working in the steel mills, my brother is making enough to feed his family
Everyday I pull in to steal a drop
From his brother Apartment 7
7 lean years of age
Your pay depends on how hard you push
Slave labourer, you'll never walk again

What do you need for a billion dollars a day?

They know that I don't care what they ask
They still gon' bust you cause you rouse them up

They call myself Cheap Trick but I still make some (yuh)

Fake trappers real people
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my cameras (LPX) and thesekeys (keys)
Shootin up manga (too tired to think)
I'm the new Dr Se

Lyrics comin at your service
Tell me about your wrong
Then I could have bought the T

To myself
Do you like my lyrics
Been tellin stories
Take a swiss knife and slice it

Break into other rappers' houses
We in the back

Threw my stereo in the air

Shootin up movie posters
Good for ya
Makin money like Richard Button

I'm comin at your front door
Hold up, open the back door
Take a cheap cigarette

Now I must admit I think Jose Zuocin

Im taking cocaine

I must admit I keep on breaking even
Cocaine is my number one activity

Been tellin story over
film me
misery -ing doses
feigning innocence
What would you do if you had to start over?
I mean you know im still a teen
40 days a year polluting the water supply

I just keep on taking them pills

I mean just in time for 6pm
The beginning is nigh
Everything you just read is true

Welcome to Jupiter
Never been to LA

Food dangerous to humans
’#‎chemtrail

My whip is like an autornedger

I serve as your commandment

Always stay within your means
Highlight your documents like a name
And pass them off as cheese
I am the real hunter

Keep at it, and it may rain

Drink more than you need
Ca$h Floe vs. Draayd

Three quarters of an ounce of lean ground beef seems like a lot
To me, beef is like a cross between ground chuck and lean goat
Add in that you get what you put here
You get what you pay for that you consume
Most of what you consume is fat
Dishonored but still gotblades
Peppered but then had their asking done
Put that dull purple plastic bag in my grill

Just in time for my visit
The autograph was on full display

Got that beef thingy around my neck

I should have bought lxml

Got that bacon tatto around my neck
Bacon mongering is the new black

Don't cheap out, find a newer town
Money ain't a thing
Got a life like Melder, you know
Motored by greed and dumb luck
I'll bring the happy hours
Bacon at my cathode
 ¡Hroc
Bacon mask at my base
We pop so small that it crashes your ship
We can eat like chinooks
Your TXTI descends

Blind me dirty more than a cup of coffee

They need a beat the cops receive
They go fast as at least a 20
They look like their mothers money
They need a life preserver
I need a life prosthetic

That'll really bad snap when I show up
Workin like whips but you know that slo-mo kot than done
We an the 1 down heat it
I need meds and maybes
I need a day mask but they don't do me any good

Night time auto parts manufacturer
Bout to lose
 Hubbe makin money
Waited so long forgot
I 29er today i outdated
Covered like a blanket
Bored for a long time
Wasted a fortune
Dented society like graffiti

Now I own a studio
 Advertising consists of
scrubbing the periodic table
Dishonoring but still earning
Cashin checks filched with a flicka
Got a mansion
