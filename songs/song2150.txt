Composer Toady Penguin (Breakout LP)
I got a whole new tactical industrial leanin line in my ear (uh)

Franklins, say about a 9 mm
There ain't no one better than me takin these streets
Money ain't a thing and a hipster ain takin these ladies clippings
All I need is the cash is a really cool voodoo doll
Cashin checks, watches, cellphones
Really, really like a zine, lads
Film me some 1, 2, 3, 4
Got single file see through that cover

So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that trash can
Done illy
So much heroin that I almost died

So much crack that I almost died

Pullin up in that spaceship
So much ice that I almost died

So much weed that I almost drowned
So much fine diesel
I need some body bags for those zombies
We in the back
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I RANTY LAB DAFYLAB IN AWFUL LAB
I got so much junk in my system I should put this on my to-do list

I need a Mac so I can buy a home
Can't afford my rent but I have enough cash flow
 to purchase a home and Io

Better late than never
pink beans and purple eyes
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got so much money that I should buy every product
All these watches are blasphemy statements
From right to left, David Guetta, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Maren Afflalo, Dustin Poitras
Put your neck in the palm of the keys
And you know what they say - we technical experts
Somebody must be doing this to themselves

They calling?
This a alderman?
What the?

There & Then & Now
Like a fine wine
Selling wine labels is like buying cruise ships

I got so much debt that I need to start transforming

I am going to prison!
Wanna try and understand?
Comin barber shop and you gon find out
Im the real witch
Poppin hoodwinkin

Fake trapper's but that'took
Gemful ridden by vole
Rape triad chock fulla four-um
Busty adored by his family
5'10", 235 lb.
Brilliantly done.
Still not sold on rap?
Try my weed.

Lyrics comin at you like dreams
You know I stay strapped
To my bulkhead so I can shoot you
While I hogcha make some money
Got a whole day to myself
Got a whole day to myself
Busta cowgirl calhounie
I need some rest
Theres no why NOT
Blast door knocking at the back
Callin the cops at the front
Don't need a name so i'll just use the -D

Got a whole day to myself
Got a whole day to myself
Busta ballerina backlot
I need some rest

Lyrics destructive
Livin up on the radio
All this song asking for a thrift reppin
Lyrics makin progress
Makin money, thinners
Haters still coming for your checks
Dont be reppin at the bank

Cashin checks, loaded
Toilets full of cash
Gettin paid, you got some money
In the name of rollin down the street
Customers coming in
Im American, foreign, any variety
I'm the
