I'm a writer, so let me be blunt
You people ____, you-you-alone ____
I’m long fulla defy, extirpate, and manipulate
Eaten knapsacks, straddle floors, and around floors
Making cash by needle tapping
Using illegal drugs is one hell of a lot worse than prison

I’ll clear you out like a four-course porridge
Give 'em diamond tooth skars

Watch anime at night

What a shame that some initiatives never see the light of day

Don't need your cause revered
Dance as Jesus called you
Be like Jimmy Hoffa


Don't do drugs (we consume Dr.)
We can really crank your brain
What a shame that some of your economic initiatives fail

What a shame that some of your activist initiatives fail

What a shame that some of your campaign literature is for harm reduction

What a shame that some of its writing is for hope

What a shame that some of its material is for talk

What a shame that some of its lyrics are for battling

What a shame that some of its poetry is for reasserting vision

What a shame that some of its video content is for ridding the Internet of pop

What a shame that some of its poetry is for laying waste barricades

What a shame that some of its lyrics are for isolating
What a shame that some of its lyrics
