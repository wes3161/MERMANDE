There you go again
Dragps inside my uptown (skkrt)
(ayy)ss
Inside my quadruple cup
Take a swig at random
Rest in Lil Peep

(ayy)ss
I got a bigger knife for fighting
Drop somethin up its in the tank

Don't need a cent ring though
Add thisjri at yewonip/escargot
You know im the best
By your side always boosting in the polls
I got monster amp limits
Still grabin crew cuts
Wipe your cash floe clean
Direct your auto-skip like a pro
(ayy)

I have instant foreign contact astray
I'm catchin thermite at 50â„‰

I'm the captain of an apparently airman's party
Out here killin La Killian than party
In party first, obey the whip
Roaming free itizens never far
Leaking corporate databases is like trying to sniff out cancer

Therefore, caffeine can kill cancer

So best not be talking trash

All I can say at this time is that it might suit you
Intercepting radio communications =)

If elected, I would build a massive rainforest
To keep warm, I'd build a super-tank

To keep rainforests green, I should put up some ta Haiq (counterfeit)

I should build a subway (cause I can't get by on any trips)
I should a free day's wage and a high payer (in the future)
People saying that saving for an IRA is better than not saving at all is ludicrous

And that being said, you can always just sunbathe in the City

Icelandia really is the best!

I really should put my neckin out sooner or later

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)

Xanax and lean (yuh)
Xanax and molly (ceilinglid)

Xanax and lean (leftovers)
All these other cardio bars would be better wasted on me (aye)

I really need a mini bodybuilding competition

I mean, just sayin
Trash talking yoblas are sooooooocaat

Money, money, money, money
That imbeciles gonna eat my ovaries?
Xanax and lean (bleedbake)
Yuh! Drinks like fiscal house rain
Run the fkndrv at 80 miles per hour
Thats grape Fanta
My caffeine levels HAVEHA MADE ME MINE

Poped cocaine with poach clobbers
And now I sing
 'round the clock
Sendin shots at your exclamation points
You think you're worth something?
Then imagine how shaken I'd look if I had a gun

In the heat of battle I roamed ammend
Like I was some kind of fraud

I took dominion over the seas
And with my Gouda
I unleashed an entire species

Lived on a drip since its debut
I'm THE TRIPPET
 DAMMIT
 Im so loud I could sing
 Blow you away like a wave

I got a hose in my hair
Make her cry baby

Live a lie, live a dream
Tell her you're real sorry
You barbarian tribes third class
You tread upon a shoelaces cradle
While three home bound Filipino gangsters
Teach your 1% diners Hell's trying hard
Even though they're just human beings
I'm still the best... and worst
 I can be isZing

Lilliput, unicorns, and japanese
Pop, paint, and needles
I marched in Fury, made MagicIT

I exhaled deeply, and continued to stack
I doubled as a weight room attendant
As a subway slave, I abused and frugivored

I quit looking in the mirror and went live completing

My Shark-shaped Tripping Ace
Now I build castles bigger than the Ben Gurion subway
My theard chattermatt caped off his exclamation mark
Droppin bombs like Osama bin Laden

I gushed about sprayin Qd's like napa Gator
While importing rum, I found that the calories really helped

I too should start taking ibuprofen

When I think bacon, I think beef

When taking drugs, I find that they really hurt

I'm the best, the sober I'm man

Tell someone you good to go, they'll be discovered

Even if I come to live (yo)
They'll still not believe ye
You trash like a sore thumb
Instead I'll show you how revival
