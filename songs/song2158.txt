Hi there fellow SWGs
My name is Billy Curzin
Appreciate your beyblades
I been hustling since day one
You know i always gotta keep this in mind

So when you find out that someone isnthin but a rumor
Im out here trying to be a better person

They say hiphop is merely poetry
You can say that shit over and over again

Don't matter that you in on a rari
Xanax
You fright no person less than me

I’m one with nature
Tap the oh so necessary onto every inch of my den
I keep an eye on everything I go
While giving speeches all over the place

One day when my every call makes a mephy
Now I’m one man, my mission is not so much compounding
Orders as fulfilling them

Orders altogether more lucrative

I have grown so fat that I no longer make ends meet

I need a life altering injection

cereal pills are so appealing
I really must beat myself to it

So I can purchase another astute

Don't need the stripes Jaune Arc
We the hardest-working in the game
Got more money than an IRS agent

I need some gang life 
Gettin paid, so I can afford my Florida home
