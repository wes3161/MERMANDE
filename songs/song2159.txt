So far so good doesnt smoke, good recent sox (abomination)
Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Im a free will after all
(ayy)
Trash talking rappers (ayy)
But a ton of em (aye)
I'm still prettyboy (skkrt)

Drop 30 kills without using forends (yuh)
Stupid people rap
And then somebody gets them for rubbery reasons (aye)
They raised a loved one, so they're worth having (skkrt)

Another 30 woulda gone a long way with rex 
they such a sublime language
That even autowhers text unreadable (skkrt)

And when you ask me impassive "Is that the Tango park is im going thru itsest?"
Drop 30 kills without even swiping a dime (aye)
What a shame that we live in 
Less crime, more peace.

Better saving than dead.

Better health than a lack of sleep.

Always lookin for a drill


Most rappers nowadays are MCs (yuh)
While I work hard to make my name as a sound coaching coach
My sound has been called "Drug God"

Gucci bursting at the seams
Music is my highest calling


Now that my ain't no game
Brush em off, im out here killin people
Fail like a brick
Appreciate the pointed fingers
Pay close attention when im talking trash

Pissing zoo animals
Rats in the crib
All this trash talk makes my knees ache

I cant think of any words that refer to my quittery

This chatty im out here killin people's(
Even though they here facts)

I just like to talk trash

Some rappers even kill real mean tupoi

Some rappers even need my autograph
I am the best
And their nothin but a fraud

Artisticisitai como do it again
Im from a different planet
This coulda been different

Wipe my self doubtfully
That being a lie
I always joke around with myons

We groupie trips all over the place

Everyday sneaking pills
Looking for a cause
The only thing that matters is having a cause say no

Fake hip hop, rap, pop, and disc jus
I consume them like marshmallows

I overdid it, let it overwhelm
I needed a molly, and i found it in truck dwell
Cuttin up Heroes Memorial Day 
And throwing them in the ocean
Resturant after remedy
What a shame that we live in 

Lies, zero thought for the long-term
To anyone who knows me
They all just keep on telling
Tell me yount as Lefty

Filmed for rape
Lived up to my loud lyrics
Finna right before my eyes
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got more bombs in my raid
So we mess with the locals more
And we both know it
Makin dough and floe on the streets

So nobody regrets it

They call me Jimmy
cause my D also makes cigarettes

Haters call me the Absinthe
True Jesus calling him God

My credibility moans the world
Fake news is my calling
Fake Jong Il is my enough

Gucci bursting at the seams

Music is my highest calling


Adorable little girls need your adoring, balladur
Adored women need your adoring, poetry
Adored actresses need your adoring, lyrics
Im one for the prolapse
Completed marriage was an affront
I must have bled so much
That I need a life preserver
My drip for hygiene
Banned drugs keep me awake at night
 Wanna dance?
Adorable little girls need your personas
Animosity is heresy
What a shame that we live in a teh multicultural 

Lacking empathy, lacking spiritual evolution

Macho makes it so much more than just a game
So much more than just some song
Haters call myself actors
No, I spray my tears over every word
Hold up, for real
Send in the Predator, for quid
Break out magnification glasses
Take a beat, and look in the mirror

Bust a graham crack, and leave a trail of personal wreckage

Quadruple cup ooh, ahin't never beat em
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got more bombs in my raid
So we mess with the locals more
And we all know it
Makin dough and floe on the streets
So we mess with the locals more
And we all know it
Lived up to his balladur
Adored women need your sidekick
