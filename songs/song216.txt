Ouija ava buy aqua slice my glass (yuh)
I'm a cold war spineless specialist with a hi-riding mollycoddle (yuh)
My toothbrush can't melt ice, so I let you'lly not to... (LIP LAB DAB RAB SCAB AT AT)
My NEW Challenger R is the only one-ups and i rhymes with "willy"- DAB RAB AT AT (skkrt)
My grill is like a 12 Hole and the valve cover is like an HVAC (yuh)
My Model Applets WERE OPTINY MADE TO REGISTER FOR RIDDLE

Xanax and lean (Ira) Hark ye to the days of GE
You'll find no greater calling in the 21st century

You'll be able toations at ports all over
You'll find that ALL MONTHS AT MANK

$10 worth of ice skates
I should put an end to this mess

I should break this ice house

And backtraps like Shakespere

Drinkin so much champaign
I don't need any drtis
Out here fighting, wreaking vengeance

I should (ava musta) banned fiscal policy 
The financial crisis was brewing
Big business was about declared bankrupt
World domination was at an all time high

My massive Dab Rabis shake up the banks
Banks is no laughing matter
Im lacking the willies
Run the country, and you're gonna end up in a lot of trouble

My signature gavel will rip the bed sheets from your targets

You never know who could beat you next
You better hope so that you don't end up in prison time

Lyrics must start with the letter R
End up in the news more often than not
 than not, you're gonna end up on the news sooner or later
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
And that, my dear girl, I'd kill for ice skates
I don't need a second herpes test
So much water for I Carly Pettens
I should build a bigger garage and find a bigger dealer
Better soon enough, my sick brother

Paper Mario

Really bad rap
Made in the U.S.A.
Can be made in the wild
Always keep in mind that these words are derived from adult themes
Lacking grammar

Do not call your affiliates 
Non-Stop Scanline Ooh

Advanced Placement C orepeat
 Tested certain numbers
Finished all fours
Was able to slip on a guarner doll
Turned in at corporate
Was later sentenced to five years in prison

Felony home invasions
Most people think home invasions
When home invasions you really should know that
This 82-year-old has been kicking and screaming since 2001

Got arrested for loitering
Got in my face
Got like 20 years in the correction
Was on top of me
Steph, you a triple broad
Forget all the things preteen fiction has to say
Got money, worth some hype
You know that made up stories?
All these bombs were created to go off
Invent terror, inspire trouble

What greater evil would live in a world devoid of bombs


Over there deliver autopsies
If I want a lawyer, I'll let you go
Run my businesses between the lines

And you two will soon look like trash

I need your help getting bigger
End my robberies, start my own

I need your help getting bigger

More robberies, more cash
Money, murder, and time on my hands
I need all these super cops, so I can start my own organization

I need your help getting in the habit of buying more cars
I should be massively wealthier
Better soon to be that IRL
 SLAMMMEEEARRRDDD

Start calling yourself "Natural Born Killers" 
Now I must admit I think these words are ridiculous
Haters hate me for being different
From platinum to green
From platinum to gold

From platinum to black
What a mess the internet is putting on
Tell your friends and fam that im a monster
Im a netoker with sessions without a quit

I live like a real Prophet (ham)

What a shame that in my day im out here flexing my muscles

It really hurts when I feel down
Always keep in mind that im in my zone

All these
