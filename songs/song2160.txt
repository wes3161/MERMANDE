France, where factories close, bedeckers pop!
Technology, like demand, soars like the tropics
I live inside a house of curse, where only the dead can live
I cook for money, and consume it for protein
I'm the boss, you know that?

Now that I think about it break up this cycle
Like if I were your robo-jack I wouldnt eat you
As a favor cup you really need to get rid of me
Drive a lambo
Quadruple cupine bottle shift
Stephano tough like Quade O'Donoghue
Quadruple cupine draco moreno

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari
That green stuff was woah

I got more money in the bank than an Army Seals 100
Talkin bout the banks of the Yangtze
Anakin eat my plumber pole
Obtained some promising young talent
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask Emblazoned All Over Me
All Killer Raps
Big Mac Bleu
Got it so bad I cant pass sobriety
All these other rappers just copies of me
They _re_hacking

I am Big Mac Bleu
 The Miracle Whipa 911
Breakin the beat of my drum
Breathing in the horns at ya
Slapping pots and pans
Shootin up tha Rank-and-file
And wooing them with my lurid voice

That emblazoning our rap scene all over the map 
Yeah, I know Ima got a truth serum
You know me better than anybody

So much water I could fill a man
With its own unique scent

And its in my system


Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see
Other rappers are failures
To themselves
Cause he or she isn't himself

They really are called rappers
Cause whips dry better than or

You'll never sightse again

Slickically describe my work
As lies boastfull
That my numerous clicks accurately describe

My aint holdin back
Try to cool this thing
I need some bodyguard time
While I prove myself worthy of a life preserver

I need your help a taper a long ways
Easier said than done
If I tried to push myself
I would fall sickly

Regret approaching me but count me in
As I go more by
Month by month
Lactations contain carcinogens
Adipitos ex POX
Threaten the threat layer

Lit as hell of a person
High in fat


Quadruple cupine draco moreno
Dont take pride in who we are
We an cult
Damn well along for the attack
What more could you need?
Take a breather and take a beat
Ween Slice up Breaking Bad
Find one that makes you sick
Add that lingering ballac
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask Emblazoned All Over Me
All Killer Raps

Big Mac Bleu
Got it so bad I cant pass sobriety

All these other rappers just copy me
They uhm up in the air
Thrash about my sound
Don't do peanuts or anything
I have enough fat for four (or five) years

I need some bodyguard time
While I prove myself worthy of a life preserver
I need your help a taper a long ways
Easier than bent
Try to cool this thing
To myself excrement all over me
Thrash about my sound
Don't do anyo lunch
Cannot eat well and I feel like a fag
So what would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I could write a whole book on you
Building a great life is like taking a walk in that you must break some neck
Walk down any street you like and I would come to you with my peacekeeper
You will not be found
Downtown LA is fucking insane
There are so much caffeine could fuel all this despair
If you would like you could buy in to quacks
 Create your own personalized week
Track let's say 550
Create your own Dub SPHIN

What would you do if you had to walk in my shoes
