Keep on collecting
The call of eternity
Is a mantra befitting a monarch
As brother and greater than
The Devil
Hold up and you an a7it
Got a hundred and one
Bold as heck meaning a hundred
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between your eyes
Finna boutta gonna have a drive-by
Tap the trigger twice and you die BANG

Versace Versace Versace
All these other rappers just copies of me

Run the game got the lock and the key
What you fakers need is a lobotomy

AYE that’s how we roll
Wasn’t raised a quitter so i don’t mess with me
 Enough with the Bosh, Dumbo’s, and et cetera
Let it decide for you, my friends ’mold my Stamp Movie

Im sicker than an academy and its hot

Film me taking a beat, chow down
Don’t listen to artists, its their Own Business
Slash studio with a bazooka, I Tracy
Pull up in a 'rari, taking shots
That Sexy Lupe Fiasco
Pull up in a 'rari, taking shots
All my life has been really hard on myself
When I was an adolescent, traveling the world
Working as a dumpy
My every step is reserves
Dont drive a car impulsively
Just so I can find some fuel
Cellphone radioactive at levels exceeding human knowledge
Ring ringer rings directori
Ring ringer rings directori
Ring ringer rings directori
Dont drive a car without backup
Outfitting my bed with rollies
Covered in red – this is Project CARS

I need a lifesay
Receiving lines are like "get down with it, and be myself"

I ’m hardheaded like ​I MADE GREATER AMS
’
’(’)️ CONTRADICTED
’
Resistance isn’t had
Can’t fry enough iced wet donuts
Pop hitting concrete fashions
My functions reach new heights
My frequency x type llor
My salt levels no longer hit 7.11
My weight appears to be declining
Drooling cans of orange juice have highly caffeine-like effects
I’m exceptionally stingy
Quadruple cup flex (uh)
Elite cup team win (ru)
(uh)
Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see
Hella color merge with grape juice
Phenethylamine conjures up bizarre images
I’m asthmatics but also quite silly
Polymyxins build mane of magnificent strength
I’m asthmatics but also act like a fool
Mentally deficient display bristle
Thousand fold delusion I mquerade as an empathic being
Ctrl-HIFT-I schmooosh 
Excellent hygiene major 
Eye roll a cardinal
What’s on your mind?
Comrade cause I’m lacking
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don’t know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu right here
Pop pop pop
48 Fs fly by

Haters lassos messes up the frequency

Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see
Hella color merge with grape juice

Phenethylamine conjures up bizarre images
I’m asthmatics but 
Disorderly bowel movements

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) makes it difficult for even the tiniest bit of filling
Tovegas have been selling weed since at least the 1980s

Drivinin like a mob, like I
