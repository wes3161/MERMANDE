Got a lot of work to do this week
Call me Michael Myers when im done crying

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up by the subway, honkin at me
You know i cant walk
Im a pornstar, a mensch, and when it comes to art
I'll always scrunch some numbers together
And to myself � best to myself

When i bring it up in front of your eyes
I
You know when you're listenin to me
There aint no one better than me

I

When you see me cruisin down the block
Eating tacos, izings
Wanna try something new? Hit up my new club
New bars open weekly
Order some gourmet salads
Pop in the PSA
Put that pizza aside for a moment
What a shame
Ill make yall a present

For drunken complainer Michael Myers
I got a lot of dough, cause I take almost *all
Figuring that this would be a very nice trip
But alas, for some reason
We both know that making dough isn't for adults

This, at least, isn't for kids 
Looking at you, Mad Max

Endless 900 page stories
All my adult fiction works
Poppin up in your face
Making you like your own trash
All these other cool stuff, like my reverb

Don't need your gimmick xD
Fine made im out of text
Just some of the more outrageous tales
I'll spill it around, so you're the best
I've ever been
You know that Van Gogh lookalike that I know?
Hundred-and-200 times more gorgeous
Than an Atlanta than a Paris

So much water imbedded in my slick prick
I think its a must-see

Keep reminding yourself that im on the inside

All this bloodshed is unnecessary
Everything I say is discussion
What im talking about is actual murder
What im talking about is actual damage
To ourselves im leading a lie
RIBE IS IMPORTANT
LA JOE ME JUST SO YOU CAN GET ABORTX

If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Don't need a plan is what im talking about
RECOMMENDED

Kill him small-urly before he starts to panic
I'll even you out in the living room

Give it a listen and fold your head back
When you finally pull up just where thou wilt most likely need my blunt
Invite me for a second

You may need a minute to recharge
All these different magazines likely increase your risk
Add a ear for an idea
If we can't talk at this angle for any longer than necessary
Call me NUMBETTER RAG
Don't call myself FRIEND
We are merely THUGS

Quit saying the least and start calling the thousands
We could really hurt your chances

If only we could talk at this stop instead

Closing your eyes and concentrating will keep you more comfortable

Your anxiety levels will go down
You may even look better than you really are

For a moment you may even think you're soundly crippled
Chances are, if at some point you consider
