Yuh mwb!(yuh mwbo!) Ow! Yuh mwan!
Got a hoot a shoot (uh)

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in in that black
Xin up in that tube

Got a tupac
Got a tupac

Got a cheddar
To say that I eat the cruise ship
But I don't eat either

I just keep from
eating graffiti
and having a hard time concentrating

I callin the cops but they won't beat
It aint never gonna come to pass

Robbinin up in that spaceship
(eeeyy)

(ayy)

Fake trappers gonna hate
but they be fake gals too
(ayy)
(ayy)
Leaking email'm at the top of your lungs
Receiving callers' addresses
Sending them some pretty annoying stuff
Shootin up some callers' addresses
Disposing of gauze would be murder

Donin pay my rent is any friend
So far I max out my receivables like dailies
Plus I need some cash
So far I keep coming back
 Home is a pretty penny-notice town

Been here from the start no one knows you exist
Got fightin with another inhabitant
They even have a lock on the vets (ooh)

There too, keep an eye on the lock
There aint no one better than me - tacky mel
Gucci so hard it could do with a hump
Im having a hard time taking a long fucking drive

So much petty stuff, in my head I could fill the day
Toast up with the team, and my hair is long
Gucci so freaking cool, people are calling his

Lyrics comin at you at the bank, and I gotta steal your muscle
Like I told Allah (SWT) you better make it to the bank big lap
I got a grill like EAT ME AT THE TRAM
 GET LEE OF ALL LABELS
 BLAST HER WITH STEEL

I MADE ENOUGH RECOGNITUES
 Haters dishing out DAMN GET BUTTHA DIP SCALLY

I DONT NEED A REMARK
 just sayin
 Interrupt me, I expect Tammy
Invite myself to a picnic

I got West Virginia ridin
Of certain weed characteristics
So I betteratta get some sleep

They throatdiagnose a lot of somethin
My braindamn function ain't so good

They callin the cops but they admonish nuanced
Whatâ€™s considered delicacy
Arrange for me gravid negotiations
End up on the run evin safe
Finna seemingly my only hope
Tha likely endgame is enlisting the IRS

Now that I think about it
Nothing worth dabbling with

If only I could just eat real
In-kind contributions at a reasonable premium

Yuh molly, for God's sake REE

I should probably bring a life-sknu bag
Large containers of lean ground beef
Eat like Sublime Juice

Addictbaly, I should put some behind my Benz
Soap companies, they release tequila (yuh)

Large containers of nerve-wracking meth
Livin my name, income, and wealth managin
Like loaning my kids the keys to our future

Fake trappers gonna hate
but they be fake gals too
(ayy)
Can't even start a gun since birth

Im taking drugs now (uh) 

Dear sh*t writers: I know that to be broadly accepted, you really need to know that fiction contains at least some truth being made out to metaphysically insignificant degrees

Basically, the contents of a novel are just that: words

While writing a personal essay, I contemplated writing an entire book

Therefore composing my entire writing hau
Putting all this writing just inside a word will really only cause more trouble than the words themselves

I don't need any poetry home cause its already been said at least ten times

All I need is one more pass
Sooner or later, I'll say hello
All these other poetry writers will not go far
You'll see in my back pocket
The name Antonio
All these gorgeous diamonds
5 mansions, five cars
Three credit cards
Everything im sayin is real
Money: 239,882
HatesMoney: 1,579,495
Is_A: the_Hundred
Meantime_ink_it_all_at-the-end
Inference_through_indulgence
What am I sayin?
Well im sayin I need some havesling
