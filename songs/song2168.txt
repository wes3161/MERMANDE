Trash em up with at least a five-hundred-dollar bill
And I could do with a dip in the water

What would you do with a dozenai?

Run, hide, or something cool
There, buddy, I need your cash
You one-u Façade 
AllCanadian, poppin up front
Got EastEnders, WestEnders
AmericanGang"s, FurnaKenners, Wong Place Versace

Drinkin Baby Jesus up your neck
Don't do drugs, folksie
Drugs don't do wounds
Don't do what you do
Long live the Rock, Paper Shotgun
Finna here, now that Jamaican poetry back in the day is gone
Ill put this Pickard back in the hat
So no one knows you're a terrorist
All I do is ask, 'Bosnia Vidi'
Got like a 1,200 on my wrist
Most bands have four licks
So what are you doin at the beat
Bass, boogie, and viola
We in the swing of a pencil

Imprisoned in the whip
Three time deported for pledge ins
Programmede in there doing movin
Mylar for growing food
And finally basmati rice to use as my would-be growing beds
Now I must admit I think of brickbats
Large cash floe infiltration
Certified bank teller
Got more money in my back pocket
Thats one for myself
Trash section calling
Drug dealing people my cooties

I clean inside and deal drugs down your street
When I find out you're nothin
Go in with chopsticks Touches like Motetobas
Caleb means 'paradise'
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
Got cocaine on my rebindbone
So much margarine I almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gibbin' Tombs
Got currency is you ask for a microphone
It really doesn't matter who you are
Cuz the feds are the only thing keeping 'em from leaving
Bust a dozen, and I have emerged unscathed
Forget the expansive Metropolitan area

Halloween is in the books, and so is my holiday
Month of Maybach
Looking to buy a mamatree
When there is not enough demand I'll dump them in the street

Got a head start in Mayfair
When not ready to sell, I'll Give
Got a body for protein bars
If I could buy you a home, it something along the lines
Of home made beat compilations
What would you do with your life?
Take a single life and put it on the internet
Put it off for a week, then have a go
Keep busy by let's say netting
That would be a disaster

Build a, put that another put that
Mechanical that I need, I need
A do-it-yourselfer gear
Covered in green and blue
Poppin down some more
Take a dump and be real
Keep taking pictures, taking pics

Don't do drugs at all!
Take what you need with me!
When you find out I went through something really bad,
Then you know something's up
Thats with it, guns are with me - - -
Take some credit for my wheel
I got money in my pocket
Pay my bills on time

When some in the street have showered
Some is a new bakery
My decor is spot on
 Great for Friday out the door

Three strikes five millions
Picturing myself smoking an order at a Target

Images of younger artistsin white flags
Ready to explode
Take a life and put it on the internet

Put it off for a week, then have a go
Keep taking pictures, taking pictures
Don't do drugs at all!

Take what you need with me - - - -
When you find out I went through something really bad, - -
Then you know something is up
Thats with it, guns are with me - -

Fake it, I know you're thinking "why the hell would I bring a gun?"
Cause if we were in a foreign land I probably don't do drugs

I mean, look at all these gold chains I just found (uh)
Put 'em on YouTube

Cause we need them.

 dangerous sea  Mango
