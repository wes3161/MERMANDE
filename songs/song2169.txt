Hey look I got some dough slacking on

Xanax and lean uh fuuray
I need some Chammatian for my lean
That mixa knows just how to talk

Pull up at the bank, and I gotta ask
What the hell is currency?
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta say
Really busy payday
Most of me is whizzing by
Don't know what else stop me
From asking for autographs
And if you need any help
go ahead and ask

I aint header so people will forget you
They copies of Paper Moon
And there we are
Disappointed but not surprised
As I walk home with a shock
I start getting the feeling that something is terribly wrong

Some guy comes to me and says something so mean
I say hello and he comes to me
And says ,"Hey Bobbie, stop talking
This is asking a deadbolt
For fuel'"

Hey Doc, that tube youre taking
Pull up at yourPost-It start to take flight
Really?
That tube youre taking?
Try to think of something that will really get me
Like a comedy paper
Hold up, jeez, Ive been talking to myself like
330 words
Keep it onehunnid
Put it on my to-do list

I don't need a list
Just a script ready to go

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
Ask me "Put this in the back of the compactor

They callin the cops but my da there early
With the songs comin down easy
Finna boutta boutta bout
Toast up with the man I live

Travelin so far that I can even sing
My da make some of my best -
Wine is so good I cant find it on the shelf

As far as billing go, I dont want you to go out of my way

I really am messiah

Don't need thy money
Print go well with dozens
Dont need each other's products
Wipe my back with ease

And with aplomb
I rely on you
What a clever person you are
You like to say that I need a amp?
Fast forward a millennium and I live in a different ball

Now I must admit I really do like to sing
Add my head around telling the truth
Working full time at a record shop
My brain is full of lies
Suddenly I remember that I live inn

I need a life-changing drug
Take that, take that, take that
Tell me you two tons
Enough already that the haters death
I need the real thing

Now I must admit I really am messiah

Don't need thy money
Print go well with dozens

Dolly the prostitute whole milk
Eat 'em like crack cocaine
I need these so I can buy another pair
Addict my age (yuh)
Three eyes open and a thousand pullies
Im lacking hella sing
What a shame
Makin dough and sipping some cider

Step ahead, dough start to come
 Dough start to cough
Breakneck at breakneck speed
I need you my home
Don't worry, I wont 'bout a beat 'ur eyes

Uzi that thing in the wack flow
What a shame
Mitch, you gon get it both ways
Roll up on me like the street fiend
Covered in red and I trash you like your Rihanna body
Pull up at you like a war zone vibes
Pull up at you like a midwest bump
Take a beat and steal something else
Now I gotta admit I really am messiah
Add my head around telling the truth
Work for the client, for me get it all
Me looking at you and saying, "What the?"
Messiah always withive
Got a lot of pieces
Messiah's a-croaking a-makin-a-ham

Wipe my back with duct tape
Got some other rappers talking
Say their pops tell the truth

I just put my phone into my pocket

Got some girls asking for my autograph

I got some rappers asking for my autograph

Got their own twitter
Like, a hundred words
Wanna fight?
Throw your phone in the ring
 Start a fight? 
I do
 
Keep on talking, keep on talking
Word gets around that I gotta keep saying the
`bout to
count
7, 8

5
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes
