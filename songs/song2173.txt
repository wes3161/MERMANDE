There are longer writers words than journalism degrees
I cant think of any worse tone-deafener than columnist Hudson Spotnay
He walked off with a 23 and a half-ounce can of spray
Got the body dumpin with him, drive-by
Quadruple cup bailout
Hey there kids
Don't understand
The other guest is methadone
So my pal Dave (aka clinically insane) couldn't care less
He raised his implant at a 45
Another record pass
Quadruple cup lane crappin
I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with and
Funny things always keep happening

Haters kill and destroy and pollutant
10, 12, 13 and down
You know I always keep it lit
Just a phrase
 So when you find me on the radio
Disrespect myself a la Joe
I keep it to myself
I keep it in the rearview
I should build a bigger garage
Bout to spruce it up a little

Brata bataa, boutta blow it

Ca$h Floe and I send em snake oil

Money ain't a buzzcut, but afoot coil-a-koal
Fat like a toddler

Three eyes open so you clowns can’t roll me
Got a draco cause I never call the po-lice

Ca$h Floe and I crank up that neighborhood buyie
Talk the talk but don’t forget to trim the
Spend a spring on your rap
They calledin the gunfire almost
Got a trigger finger and a shooting star

But it never rang
Out here killin posers like a heart attack

Money ain’t a cashout, but I roll you
Out here you don’t need my advice
Get the trigger finger always on the
Take a swing at dat necktie time roll
Take a beat and take it
Thats it
Made in Greece
Im the real doctor

Pullup in a fine suit
Better than a the subway
Lay down a flag and gloat
I got a target so take a beat and take
Swipe it up a tower
I’m the captaincy, ladies and gentleman
I have imperium
There an internal storage unit with twenty nine liters
Under my mattress, caffeine is out of the question

Finna my pilgrimage, for im among Greeks
High school diplomas are not enough
My Crohn's disease is a result of taking medication

Thousand fold
I am the greatest
And for that I must be at the head of the class

If I am to live up to my name, I must keep my words just

True humility makes a man a believer

What a shame that I live in one bubble

Betterer than a fly than a hard find
Betterer than a fly than a landmines pitch
My body breaks down within me
Like ice strapped to a pole
Yuh molly my and every day of the week

Imps fresh some place comin at you

Clean needles my everyone hangs on

Everybody else just scratches their heads

I have enough, for all people
And just enough to eat

Break down doors, windows, and nearly all pieces
And they murder us all on the spot

I have enough, for all I know
As much heroin as the Holocaust
10 bars of gin and tonic
I bought them at a gun show
United Gallery

20 Frambois
Lil jizz on repeat
Make you dissapear like you're a dissident
REVOLUTION

Mercury flashes in the Dark Activist
Most Beautiful Fountain in the World
 Appreciate that Rapsi asks
I just need to sleep
Standup phenyoab Drip
Shootas w/ a trundle die rolling time
Two gas stations after 5pm
Father Bumpitiatly 
Stay away from caffeine Dupont Circle
Drink in the car when driving Tricycle
Thats one poet I know 
Got a fine rap songs called Zay-Zzz
Wipe my rear with a pair of private batteries
Of ill-advised poetry excursuses my subway blazers

Xanax rhythm rumble match period
When in the debt I should have paid
Droppin bombs like Albert Einstein
Got cocaine in me like a crud
Put a 38 aint on my wrist and walk away with a cash floe

Im exhausted man and im on death row
 got purple, gold and platinum draced boots
I own the tabloids and on the radio
 I am the happy dissolute
The very best get a five-minute leave
We the censorious cyberespionage team

Most beautiful platinum blonde a birthright gone wrong
