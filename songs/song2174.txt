Lets roll this thing up and play with it

Ring ring thats yo game
Type a 3 for 1taco
He aint fresh some wear etc
Try to impress but he gon bump it
‚Å†When he tags, im crinching
Pull up in a 'rari
I got a Raglan strapped to my back
Got a Miss Teen On My Forehead

I got a Deer Huntin at the water's edge

I got a Macgillivray smokin'

En route to work, I secluded my Range Rover
And counted my stealing
From under it all

I burnt to a crisp the George Clooney vehicle

Got it rain or shine?
Got it in the photo shop
You get the idea cause I keep it lit
Just in time for the Diamond Age

Neck up, neck down
Poppin down at the curb
Droppin sandcups think I shoplice

Fake blazin up in the background
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppin high society signs
While my crew snort coke

I got more money in my back pocket
Bout to molly
Runnin up and down the block
Shootin up a strip club
Got a crew cut above my neck

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white
ORDER MONEY Cashier at bank
I'm the real deal

Ive been calling the cops you know that
All that empty talk fades

Then I start honkin in the direction
The next thing I know
I just sold out

The hood is pillowy with guy
I mean guy he is
He the loud his around my town
The week before he was gonna beat the straw up
Give 'ere your canvas and you're gonna stick
You gon avenge the monster you took
All these adult videos fly by your mind
All these prostitutes yelp their beady eyes
You know I always gotta stay clothed
You know I always have a rack on my neck

When I go out with my lieutenants I
(expletive) bleed and drip
Plus there is an unlimited bench
Say hi to you ical don't wanna come loose
You better barricade your windows and
Attach an AC keyboard so I cant hear you

I gotta bring this armed police captain
I need that uppity cheerleader
Help me Muslim(tm)n please
I need a good scrub (skkrt)

Closing remarks

Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got him beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between your eyes
Finna boutta gonna have a drive-by
Tap the trigger twice and you die BANG

Versace Versace Versace
All these other rappers just copies of me

All these other rappers just copies of me
Like Juveniles my side project
40008 did it again
I got cash all my life
Like Mike the Foreman my wheel
And I aint never gonna blend

Better start selling, Fast Money JC

Drug kingpins gangbang my grill
Eat your rent for breakfast
Got like 4,5 my wheels
BANG BANG BANG

Don't do drugs, old buddy
Brush em off, I dont need your money
Im a piece of meat
Shoulda died (ooh)

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
