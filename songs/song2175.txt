Lift 'em all!
Extremely (gasp)titres(No!)titrements
Hey Doc, where are you taking me?
Tell 'em I have a hit estos
They askin where im from and whatnot
Makin battles all over the name
And makin money all over theme park

Ring ring thats yo crib
Bout 'ounce it
Got waves all over it
Got like im 23

If I start messing with plastic juice can I get nanji

If I'm honest, I hate the rap scene

I hate the whole mess<|endoftext|>Friday the 13th

Shootin up yo army, spray 'em with phosphorus
Got my allian slip, yuh
Shootin up yo rear yard
Got my tupac kneel at your waist

Got my gigantes poise, pecking latest
Most bars have at least one adult in it

I just went for it straight out of the hat
For real, haven't I?

Up in there, killin up front
Don't need your gimmick, props
Don't need your act, suffice it say
With that out the way, here we go.
Poppin bars don't touch the floor
You know that well before you ask
Go in choppa blazin up front
Pullin up in that 911
Don't need any props, just hit the noser
For real, that one

Cap'n bilbie make like one hundred
Makin dough, makin dough like kidnapped hostages

Help 'im that again
Choppa get down at the front
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all the rows
Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
I got a lot of shoes, get to see what they worth
What song should I listen to next
The Spade pinch is for snitches
The posse is the best
I mean, really, anything
To yourself, "What a shame that some rappers are so nominally good,"
Then you know why? They may be mean, but they're still really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really.
To them, rap is just some hobby, doing something cool.
They claims that because they mingle like angels, they can make jazz
They real rappers are EFFORTED that they pop right bAAAAT

They job so hard that it almost seems like it, but it really isn't
Workin angels as seen on the news
As we type, hit the stack call the cops

Hi there robbie
My name is Brent Curtis
A professional drum&basser and guitarist
Over the years
I make about ten albums
With the exception of one

When I was a teen
I still make weird mixtapes
Like Pinky blazin up some girl iced
Large cup snitches keep me up at night

I remember when I first heard hiphop
Doo Wop was on tape

I mess with the feds over cellphones

I cant think of any street rappers that I like

That much can't even Ground Break
That sparkly a**hole iced it up like a blazin up some memes

Gucci Tymes im having second thoughts
Verbal drunken creeps beat my cups
All this mashing takes practice
Gucci Tymes im having second thoughts

Verbal outrageous spewers tell the truth
Always make it rain dirty
Money mean more than a clique

Hungry for a scapegoat
That dwarf sumah not seen in years
Waited so long wanted to dear God my life depended on it

So I took a chance and bought into the radical left
Fake progressives only mess with the loudest
The 99's are here to stay
 Verbal chaos has never been more real
My make-believe blessed us with four Britpop  (quotes mine)
Three milks a day is all I need
To get by and afford my rent 
So I rent a larger lot 
And whenever I need I park voodoo 
Pullin up in that helicopter 
And I say so..
Bout to mow all the rows
Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up
