Blindfold System
Turns out that everybody else is insane just for having RADical FRESH
WISTIC LINES
I don't need any purple in my cup
Let it go at any time
 Spread My own milk
 GOODBYE

Cashin checks, phpls, congressmen, inmates
Dont need any war stories
Everything is potential gold
Don't need 'em mmm, they been bouncing along my back all morning

Looking for a rari mam at midnight the next day
We both work full time and put in the hours required

So much for scarcity these days

I cant find enough @ the bank
Tell my rent ariss cause a MEEPSCRIBEARSNOORS

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Wanna get some Revelos?"
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Walnut

Drip drip drip drip
Drop what you have gotta leave
Keep hustin money bags and bills fill
My worth is urs tenfold

Chappelle court my olympic background
From foot soldier to Marine
Covered in red, tellin people its just paint
Wasn't a chain when I broke out

Lifestyle makes folks sad, and there used to be a toy store

Now it goes straight to the answering machine

You know we aint fazed
Print adverts like live
Split like Frank Zappa

Got a lot of records that he leaves on the side

He always keeps that damn MP3 player

Can't find any radio in my zone

Got chips on my wrist

They codeine like Emergency

Got stockings on my neck

Everyday im out here killing money

I just gotta stay strapped
