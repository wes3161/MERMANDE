Writer darkey how we be funny
With a bit of experimentation I think we can really get where we are
Goin by just something I just added
Fake straight up polite
Down at the bank I be happy
Just cause MARCI JACOBS is a habit
I eat more vegetables than, for example, beef
And carbohydrates are stingy revelation Spell us off like a good call

'Cause at least some vegetables taste good
And carbohydrates dont
I hate the rap scene because its full of them
No one knows for sure what its about
Its like every day im still in my thirties
Ill put em down soon enough
Man my armory gon bust

Like the hospital from 2005-10

No shoelaces I don't trip
