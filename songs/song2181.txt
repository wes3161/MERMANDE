So, what're you doing?
Try to mess with me. (smack)

Call my generator.
5100 ABC Menkoov responded to your challenge
Got a lot of them left.
Put them in a car and get out the door.
Got a lot of really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really.
Yuh!
Gotcha!

Pissed I drip
Pop you with the stendo clip
Toast with goat shit on my hip
And I pull up in a 'rari

Gettin paid, clear the highsec lot
I need a cutthroat delicatess
Go in with a bevy and rap
Drizzle, bam, bam, clear the highsec net
So grouchy, I strip
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies, each day of the week (gang gang)
Poppin molly, molly my way well-liked (yuh)

Ipsat thou, you mind boosting my IQ?
Ipsat thou, you mind boosting my charisma?
Drop 30 on me and I go brat-a-tat
Ipsitant, you mind but describing my scent?
Dripa drip drip drip
My clique is better than the Gospel!
Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up!

Lyrics comin at your a$$
Trash talking my scooter
Wanna try and party?
Just kidding
Go in thinking you're gonna end up in a fire
They advertising their gear, real stores
You ain't never been able to convince a pooch
What a travesty that must be
Toil and hard-boil
Been here from the start no one knows you exist
Got a lot of shootas other than yourselves
Why would I stay here if I could?
Got a whole slew of flea markets under my roof
I really must sell
 The only way I can get past Sanctuary
What a shame that is

There is no nature preserve in this whole 'rari

All this fresh air makes for a really miserable day

Not to mention, the fact is that so much of what I eat
Weane the environment
We'll just just stay inside drip
Weircing our own destinies
And each day that we go
Pulling up in that Lamborghini
Pulls up in that Lambo
Pulls up in that black Benz
Pulls up in in that white Ghost

Pulls up in that cruise ship
So much ice that I almost die
Maybe I should buy another yacht

Don't need a name
Just keep that phone
Keep ringing
You know I always am
Carry on
Just like I always have
Got numerous accounts
All this fresh air makes for a really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really

Nothing...
Shootin up heroin honestly
I don't know what else rhymes with---
With that headset
Talk incoherently
Take aim, girl
I don't need your help
Just keep pointing
Give it a listen
I live logical living

The greater my chaos the greater my flex
The use precision the greater my pain
The only advice I can give

Thought provoking
Random thoughts keep coming
Im lacking in judgement

Don't need therapy
Just keep being ________

What an extreme title 

Ye auck, that aint

Mask on, boutta put this
Mask on, boutta put this
Pull up, we the have
Shootin up heroin really really well
I got over it with humor
At some point im coming up with new
 brags
Even if at a later date
Break down some windows and take a break
Don't do drugs
They are commonly found on the streets

In strip joints
In the streetwear
Offenders are harder to find
In Russia, where "sodomy" is illegal, that translates into 13 [per]mellas
In my other China, where paid sex is illegal
My life is full of freedom tinged by gold
I could speak Chinese, but I don't really know what so say
Walk the street barefoot and I'm mistaken
In my sleep, I think I'm seeing the sun
In the street I say hello
Sooner or later
I'm gonna smack a dumpy
15 yard lean
Large cash-nyhoo 
(eangold)

(Money money)
Events like that
Im the real suck

Lets get this over with, im tired of your fakery
Im out here making
