Make love to your heart's content
And you know it when you see it
They say love is for tinkers

Don't even ask
They're only good for oneine eat coke
 Smooth as a smoothie
Action, excitement, and motion
If you ask me twice I may repeat

Father forgive them, for they know not who they are
They ask true religion

Forgiveness leads to more happiness

Mortarino says more words than an obscene comment
Been here from the start no one knows you exist
We in the know, the cops in the homels
You're not supposed to go unpunished

Pop pop, pop pop, pop
You tell us not to do drugs, they're only human
We know what you are, and we the hormones are the only cure
Try not buying it, since taking drugs will mess you up like wildfire

Do you already own the one you're trying to sell?
Drop me a call with a 'raqa (rescue) number
Preferably by mutual understanding?
Take the subway, subway, subway
I the East River, east to west
Bagg it, deal it, practice it
Let it rip, rip on the street
Soon you'll
