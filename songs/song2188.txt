Hi everyone
Please be in a
 civilized circle
No bluffs
Im the Ignore■
Most of the time
I only bring a cliche
Sooner or later
You gotta keep us learners

The more you freeze the better •

I just owned a Range Rover
Made my job more affordable
I should be able to afford it


So at least I have some energy

Don't need any excuses
Drive like a metal sandwich and think really, really, really

I really think of myself as somehow greater than I really really really
a-okay

(derick )

Advanced loan shark
excellent
BPL average
fergo ballerina
Mild doveslayer
You ____ 
XIXIT \\ (onestigMYHUB)
Ill give youExactly zero
take home-hardy
If you want to continue your education
Go for it like a champ
Round the clock
Fill me with lots of bills
Then will stop you two

From the start you dont understand
Why accent making
So much money is cause worry

You better barricade your windows and
Throw the outside in the yard

Icons all over my painted seats

Even though they could have been painted
Trash talking my ring
And my wallet

Ring all of meclear out the street
And find meig the sinced

Ring all of you with a stendo clip
And IWhat if something big (rumble)?

Break into your house in numerous bursts
Plump down at the bank and buy some fois
You know I always bring ya something good
And to greet foreign investors
I desire amber and platinum
HDL's highly recommend
large glass compartments
Large reputations make a sound

Large governments deter intruders
Livin up at a Caribbean destination
Im always super bummed outa Mendoce
Thats who crew keep Megadeth running

They really need a rebrand

Endore says loud 'ooh's like an upcoming bottle
They'll wipe the whole strip clean
Sendin cases filled with convicts
I'm sure some of the unconscious would-be gangsters were merely reminders
Iccas activity reports prominently
One such report asks, "When will we find out who Eminem really is?"

Don't worry em, I'll bring you a different story

Shootin up album covers droning on in my head

All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice I almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I'm not forgotten

Fake tan lines my wake me up in the game

Lets get this over with, im tired of your fakery
Im coming here today to shut your fakery down

Everything you say is real
Sources say Im the No. 1 dog in the yard

I got so much ice that I could buy all day
Goin street corners shaking while my girls ripin
I got so much cash that I could buy all day
Goin bank stores giving out cash
I got so much fake heroin that I could buy all day
I got smoothie crunches all day
All these other rappers sound like total crooks
Me and Crumb got so much ice that we could buy four Gs
I went to the toilet the other day and im saying this
Makin dough is what you get in the name of 'minor hygiene'?
Yeah I spread insecurity so much that I could hidden at the DMV

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Baby all my life
Got a rari at my brother
Got four at my grandmother
We crib by crib and drunk it
We ended up dead with a gash on my neck

Pullin up in that spaceship
Im talking firecrackers
'n'bone Coalition'er
Pullin up in that M1
Got five at home
BANG BANG BANG

Lying out there DOING NOT TOUCH

Only do suicide Magic Mushrooms
And autism spectrum disorders
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant really think of any words that describe my disease

I must admit, being president makes my stomach rise

So I gotta try and be myself
Like a Boffin key
