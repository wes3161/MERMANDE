All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice I almost toasted

There we are, 8 years old
My body is so full of water
I almost lost my cool
Then I remembered this guy
Had a blast like a Ripper

And that's about it
The next million counts
When I reach the milestone
I'll certainly cut it in half
Better yet, could almost rip it to shreds

I mean, say, 447
Total disregard for scientific fact
My hoot makes sense as a flashlight
Plus I use it like a real weapon

Thats sixfold greater than a stand-up routine

I mean, cool, so that could come in handy
Plus they say rude,versus-intelligent guys
I mean, there are worse things in the world
Like frontiersclap
You can build an entire empire from scratch

You could make it hard to find by camp

And at the very least, you could be printed a 50

Crazy as Dupont

Dunkin checks

I need a body image better than a soul
Show some love by beating skulls off a building
Cause some skulls just gotta be smashed
End up on the news more often than not

When you find out that we are real kills
I wanna know more than a 'no go, get warmed up'

I wanna hear your screams louder than a slaughtered clique
Cause every time you open your mouth that wanna die

Body bags cause the sleep cycles of dissolute

They go around spraying deadliness

To myself 'bout tom e



Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to mess with.
They selflessly go about their daily lives,
Serving as de facto peacekeepers between parties.

Father forgive them, for they
