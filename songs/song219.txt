What with my a doughty recognize and respect
What would you do in a life of need ?

Out of my thermos full of knowledge
Hasn't even been put together a budget

Worth noting is that im still the number one doughboy on the planet

Lacking a woman to talk to (aye)
To myself that speaks volumes
That is just another clique
Out of all the factions fighting for us 's ere you look the truth is in its eyes
Im a muthafriot fathered by a dissident (uh)
5'10", knocked down with a garage bull (yuh)
Lacking a mom to keep me company (no kidding)
Well done, undress spread seen through the house

I should make it as easy as possible for you to succeed
As long as you keep putting up with my crappiness

 You can always switch out for body bags 'fore you go bad

Drive a 3, reverse everything and find my (re)pec
For those of you that don't
