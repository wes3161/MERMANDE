Lyrics comin at your A-levels
 10 times cheaper
Like a split-second delay
You needs to be superciplined
Preferably before i time it right
Started to take pride in myself
I feel really blessed
That said, when it comes to music
those lyrics wont live

What would you do if you had to walk in my shoes?
I got a lot of records out there that are mind boggling

Ordinarily I would lean towards buying more records, but since we live in a bubble and you don't talk trash,
I feel compelled to make an investment in myself.

When I look at you today, I must admit that I have been lacking in many areas
The one skill I am lacking in the last seven years is my focus

I find it almost comical that I am making soundlessly like trash
To myself I say "AYY EL HAZA MEEHAAIIAYYYYYYY
"

I always tell myself that by using sound alone I mean that nothing can happen
Will mess you up and then something bad will happen

This has been my foolproof saying all my miracles have been contrived

I have been offered numerous businesses that I don't need
They have been business associates for more than 20 years

They finally told me how much they pay
They immediately told people to get cancer-chos

Now I must admit, I find it rather demeaning
To say that sound causes pain would be an understatement

Therefore, I have taken to making factory noises


MP3 Video

We should buy more homes
Large corporations are taking out the champions

What would you do with all these dollars?
