Cant pee
Im foreign, clean it up
Break out your soundsheets
And you unknown person
Inside my quadruple cup
Add that weed like a bust
Got a lot of stabbing insults
You know I should buy a new water gun
Cause that money don't buy

Save my ass, for good or ill
I'll kill you all if you dont bring a gun
Constrict your macrocontainment zone
To my personal hygiene
Shoot you with a nine mil

Like me clean, like a body shop

Quadruple cup central
Pull up, spray my window with rosin

Drop you with the start of poetry

Put your body in a car compactor
And put your head beneath the hood

Make you dissapear like you're a dissident

Got a lot of like-ex words for every man
Of merit
