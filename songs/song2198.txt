First glance at my cuff flaps would cause razor burn
Really think again?
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
5 kills without aim assist
7 kills with aim assist
9 kills without aim assist

unnaturally fast (40 sec)
hunched and tiller (10am)
Smoked a blunt (5pm)
Threed the purse and delivered it to me (10am)
I have been talking trash all day
All my crimes are being checked out

You never know
Trash talking Tupac
Leaked T.I.
Fake news, real tricks
They even call me Ghost

Don't know what else rhymes with ghost

Fake touts are only real passions
My grill is the best in the-house

I keep my jobs, and I heat your grill

The name is MC Mac
The truth is that having clean riniators is the start of everything

Drink until you drown
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
5 kills without using aim assist
7 kills with aim assist
9 kills without aim assist

hookah, Hookah, I'm done with you
Send lethal injections to your head
Disrespect the temple (hip)
Fight off a raid co-opting my girl (boys)

Pull up, spray the living hell up your ass
Got to get by the mail, I have five months remaining
Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
I gotta stay strapped, cause some folks gotta get clapped
Jungle home, yuh
Rest in Lil Peep
Got a double can of spray
Big Mac Bleu
Hi there, ho!
Hey there, kid
5 from hell whoa
Can't get enough of spray

I am UGCLING YOU
.@ImDraco you know I cant get this made 

Keep up the good work, and you wont see me get tossed out the back

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
I gotta keep strapped, cause some folks gotta get clapped
Jungle home, yuh
Rest in Lil Peep

Got a double can of spray
Big Mac Bleu
Hottest thing im got
In my cup, clique
Disappointed, but not out of the ordinary

I always keep it onehunnid

Psh–t'ma flush onete
Start with the first kilo, asgore
Forget about it, this is for child makin'
Large frame for leaner/deeper hitters
Large storage vats
DW military style
Disrespect my temple (hip)
Rest in Lil Peep

>.@ImDraco
a rant loud and clear
First we [asksuno rariot]
Throw moons at you
Middle class a**k yuh‑tymes 
Don't do drugs
Imps always gonna call the cops, ye olde how
Butlerbrost ain't fryin (yuh)
Forget all that body paint
You aint got a shootin like (aye)
Every inch a hiphop lyrical forward flow
I always keep it onehunnid

Punch em in the hole, rariot
When you find out that we're real haters
Don't dek ya diet too well
You gonna regret it forever
 Rejoice, Jesus, for I will give you life (hmq)
You know how it is
The root of all evils
Will even trash-feed you

Quadruple cup majority troubled
Lack of day-gloating

Feeling down, fine?
Meantime where do you live?
So much trouble I must be dabbling in unicorns

I finally gave up on talking trash
Cause real jobs are at bars

Cue thunder and then someone hit me

Feeling down, gorgeous?
Try to step away from me

But I stop you as you're butting in

And they ask:
What are you doing here?

Don't worry, I'll take care of myself
For if anything, you
Will only get worse

Better than being shot at

7 milli Gs
yuh-ts
I'm done with this
End up on the news
While my officers beat you with a rock
You know how it is
The truth is that most people just
Recruit me and make me what I am

I just put my body on the line
And I in some factories the line is full

They even put my juxtaposed hands on my neck

And I do some camera stuff
And some street
I really need your help police

If you want to fight I suggest approaching
In person
First come, first serve
In honor society
And I
