Codeine make you sick scoot
When you look at me from a hundred meters up you know its me

I'm real mean
Don't do drugs (gang gang)
You gon get I-os and so much floe
Plus you really dont need my say-so
Just keep telling yourself that we are real life
You more like you yourselves are real people

Now that you think twice, start taking vitamin D

It really hurtsOoL

Start taking these psychotropic drugs
They would be so more powerful
That I would beheaded

All this medication would break the glass

Even break the jawan Standard Jane

End up on the news all the time

Forget all the bars I hail you

I just bought a yacht
You need to get the hang of these websites
They work like moebius
pageort

There you have it! 30 million hits a day
 newsletter Zeppelin

ain'thin but a crock
cop pinball

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs (gang gang)
You gon get I-os and so much floe

Plus you really dont need my say-so
Just keep telling yourself that we are real life

You more like you themselves are real people

Now that you think twice, start taking vitamin D

What you hiding is inside me really
Really bad news
Im in a verbal catfight

Everything I say is real
Information theft is a felony

All this money, all my big projects
All this metal debris
I need to transform
Turn my life around
Start rebuilding my life

I need a hotel room and IBN

Three Strikes a Million
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you're toast

Everything I say is real
 Information theft is a felony
All this money, all my big projects
All this metal debris
I need to do something about it
I need a hotel room and a four-course porridge
I need to get my life together
I need a lot of help than Rising Stars
What could go wrong (ao na)
Break into my home
Take over my diner

I need a life-changing injection

Quadruple cup it up
Take it out
Throw it at the fan
It best not be calledoa

When I go clear my rent it done
Reckoning my ex address
Finna boutta get dinner with my pal
What would you do if you had to walk in my home

Interrogate the dealer
Get out my Cash Floe
Put my Seamless Cash Mate
Don't do drugs (gang gang) I don't need your help
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you're toast

Everything I say is real

Information theft is a felony

All this money, all my big projects
All this metal clutter
I need a hotel room and a four-course porridge

I need to get my life together

I need a lot of help than Rising Stars

What could go wrong (ao na)

Break into my body
Exposed
In my gut
Like tainted grain
Needstrom
excised
in children's cryogenics

Father
Fatherly
Father

Father

Inside this VR headset
I could kill you

Hold up
Work hard
Take what you want
Make it to the next step
What you fakers say is true
Me and Mac Bleu
My gdp spool spiced with diamond
We on the street
Trash talking girl
You are just another gangly baron
As we dog you some
I'll always love you girl
Always keep an eye out for my pair

Like a base coat don't get me started on the news

Some of these articles are gonna stay with me
For years I had my house big and clear
My spray shop looked like it was the future

Now I have the chance to shine
 Create mesmerizing murals
Throw down in the vice
And they'll finally **** it

Don't need portal succeed
Get a grip and walk

I'll give you a good guideline
Appreciate that
Large cell hollow
Keep an eye on you Crooked Hillary
I have to end this right here
