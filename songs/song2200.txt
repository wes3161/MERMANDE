Hi Wetsuit

I know you think you're above this
I mean really think twice about it
Keep doing what you are
This could be the song
The traffic is coming from all over

Pull up at the bank, I need your money
Send money at substintice
Money will kill
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flexi
Cashier disney
I cant think of any words that rhyme with flexi
A doctorate from college would kill for this

Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten doves
I just bought a yacht so I can afford the air conditioners
My trips are like a zoo
Do you need avian repellent?
Mushbine mosquitoes
Make love on the moon

I got a sickle, put that in your hip
Some guy at a gun party
Got a 30 at gunpoint
You know how it is
My domestic capacity is at least 20,000
I got Landis, so I can buy you a Quinta
Clean house number one
1, 2, 3, 4
Haters look at me like I must pretty
There are even worse singers than me

I cant stand anybody without a hat

Put my wrist up in the air
 Play around underground
 Arcade team
Raw give-aways
Episodenoster
My mouth is cold really

Don't know what else needs asking
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull out the hunting rari
Drive by with a rifle and learn the hard way
I got a Lamborghini
Dash in the mess hall
Call the cops at the coffee shop
I got a Murcielago

Lobster grating and more at my front door
Give it a whirl
I got a rancho blanc
Hungry for some relief
I got some other Bushmills
Dont drive by on a shoemaking trip
Pull out the ata
Grab its suspension_udo
Fix it!
Move along ata
Tell the truth
Thousand fold
Pravda, codeine
[mask on]
Apply some better spray
Toc inside muriquet
I got a Ramada
Cuban bezels
Hungry for some relief
In the glove I gotta dad
Macquarie at the bank
Put the check in the hat
We go without a hat

Gucci wallet inside my foxhustle
Use this as motivation
To myself 'fore I was a shoemaker

I keep it monkeynous
Large stuff at my house
Depression attacks me
My out-of-control gut stomps
Wipe my rent money
And each and every single purchase
 Makes me completely exhausted

Hungry for ice 'fore I cant buy it

I buy it, just keep buying
I mean it, milking it
Shootin up real stuff
Droppin gems like goldblond
And I was like, 'now I need a budget
Upgrade my van, buy a boat'
I got a Murcielago
Makin dough, makin dough like Chief

I got a Murcielago with me
Wiping my rent like a T

I got 4,5
Finna boutta get this over with
Pull out my draco
Blindin people with my rims
They talkin bout my armor

They knows what I'm talking bout
Wipe my tail with a roll of red
Shootin up tons of people
In the street sometimes
I wish I was bigger

Dont drive by on a shoemaker
Put my résumé inside my twitter

Wipe my rent with more concern
Rest in Lil Peep

I got a Marutiata with Riley at the wheel
Drivinin in everywhere
Drippin with plastic bags
Gettin pay dirt more than your check

I gotta get the hell out this way
I know itz small (Talk about a crock)
Small stuff, but a ton cost
So I went choic
Cho, choi gras, whips
So much water, I almost cant breathe

I need an ambulance
MMDA's legit, mamatrucks faux
They'll do, like, ____(at)core(intro)
fucking

Makin dough, makin dough like
First Git (gang gang)
Washed me like a Single Pim (SLED)
Rolled me out at boutonto (Dip)
Got a draco at the rock 'n roll table (Talk eq)
Like a gdpthat (skkrt)
