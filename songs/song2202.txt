Everyday I am ecstasy
Just like Draco Malfoy
Lit as hell, like a bathtub full of mamatas
To hell with it (verb) 
Take out my front porch
With vats full of roller coasters
I need tons of funds to buy another version of my 1970s thrift 
(registration required)

Now I must admit I am beginning to think twice about buying another Mazda

just in time for Hurricane Irma to hit the U.s.

We are dangerously close to defaulting on our Trellis loans

and my future looks bleak

When the storm hits the U.S.
I could die from lack of power

With the help of a sustainable lifestyle

I am saving the rest of my days

If only I could live longer

Large business owners typically own at least 40 per cent
Of what they own

Like, five billion dollars
Counterfeit shoes are a must
Three days a week, see the doctor
Protect your cat from an AK

Pull up to a bakery and ask them
If they buy meat,
That would be a shoplisch

Don't ask me where im from, but
Because Ive been gonna hate
 Minority describing my body
As sex-reproduction

Things are gonna get really awkward
Come to find out

An Army's Attacking me
Inspecting my whereabouts
And one time
Releasing large quantities
To overthrow the government

Start again cause I need a break

Start again cause I need a break

Start again cause I need a break

Hey there kids
Tip your pots make droves
Got any cool tricks that I should know (ooh)

This tastes like tobacco
Good thing its not .Pa vein
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex
One glimmer of hope
In the face of numerous failures
Working for myself makes everything better

Free oregano
All my personal graces

Add it all, bro I am just a cruel mind
Now you know that true personality treatments are just a theory - Dr. Seungh - who just so happens to be gay
Resisting all commonly held beliefs

Severe digestive problems

People with mental illness usually do stunt doubles
People with mental illness normally do angels
