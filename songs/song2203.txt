shoulder to shoulder
Fruit flies everywhere
I conjure up images of old ladies, like the one above
Do you want to challenge me?

I LIVE IN MEXICO

Some people disease, some keep it a good life
Some think immigrating makes them bad guys

Some even hit the streets

All these other interns are my workers
Working nights at the coffee shop
Waited so long wasn't enough
But I gon' get serious
Man, these labels are wordsmiths
Impassioned thieves keep them both at bay

They even quit with the undertones
They even gone so far as to say

I will not suffice you little incompetents
Start taking pictures of my perpetually diseased body
