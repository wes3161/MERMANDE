Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Lipity loppity loppity
baby whatever is her
What would you do if you could
Being a wit'sst (skkrt)
I got a lot of songs
You're at an all time good even
I don't know what
One day you two shall find
Drive my use car
You like me agua graham
Look at myself like an agua
Got a lot of watches
You must be insane
Work for me and my crew
Throw up in the drive-thru
My picket fence
Disaster zone
The future your dead set on destroying
All this bloodshed and destruction
What would you do if you could

I got 7 Barbie Waves
You gotta have at least five that I can get through
Don't need any dreams
Makin bars at you like an armadillo

Bust a face fill with his own rendition of "Ally"
I been selling cocaine since I was like 6
I live inside a mansion and I built it brick by brick

I need your help Kid, something bad is about to happen

Yuh molly inside my snare
Do you want to Keep or Die Trying?
I need your help Lithiumobutene batteries can hold twice as much as an AA
Try it at your next party

My criminal past outlined in broken windows
So I went after the guy at the grain counter
And got him locked in the garage

Charged the cat FINE
100% vegan
Resturant hot dog
Mac and cheese
Quinoa and pistachios
Drinkin so much water
I almost died from the caffeine

I am so failing that I can't really think straight
I should probably try and talk myself out of selling

Indian cooking more so than any restaurant

Tellingly discovering that a large portion of the population is obesity-prone
Threatening food labels
Dole hard drugs that make you panic
Caused a 33-year hospital stay for trying to sell me some cocaine

And tried to buy me some time since
Thinking I would slip
But I think I need some time to myself

Droppin bombs like Ramstein
Round up protestors, roll up their (guns) rearrests
And angle them to eye contact
I need your help getting out of my way
Start over again
Fight the cop named Xen
And blow up their block
In front of my barricade

Got a lot of guns so I better block something else

I really need those rounds for some terrorist fighting squad

Fuck you newsopsyanist
Make the people at the bank remember December
December I'll kill you using rocket science
Cashin bars, watches, and other personal belongings
Like a arsenal

Got a lot of guns so I better organize

I really need these rounds for some special
dumpster fire ambush

All this junk we keep for family picnics
 Hate the police so much that almost I should quit
But I really should keep this in my life
 Plan ahead
 Stay true to yourself and your 'er by buying the body suit
With every purchase I get better conditioned
I feel more like myself

I work really hard to pass as just like them

I hate the war and so much of what I say works

I need a reputation that I can impress even more

I don't need a professional to sell me on
try to standing up and acting like a fool

I need to prove myself wrong again

Large chunks of cocaine were found in my home
Was this for fun
Or are my activities harmful

Demonstrated in the past I will notfulness delight
To myself I must say that I am actually livelier

Even though I live a lie

I do not need anyone to teach me a single thing

Now that I have told you so, how would you know?

If you need any emergency assistance, call the police

They are number one
Call the cops every time you need them
They are the number one

Be nice guys, neighbor!

If you will a minivan full of cars
Pull up, and I will rip your rent
