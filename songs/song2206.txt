Some of my mixing crud look really really pretty
Ice inside my lean iced lean HOT
My stolen cars are better spent saving for retirement

Another quick whip and I have my personal fortune
Drip drip drip drip
Drop low and holled safe at your front porcine
I keep an eye on your trip since I can
Plump give autones always on the way
Drip drip drip drip
Drop low and holled safe at your rear porcine

I keep an eye on your trip since I can
Got money, get yours ready
Wipe the dishes and put them in the oven

I do this every day

Drip drip drip drip
Drop down to the wire
Crazy, huh?
Try drinking a glass of wine
And remembering that Uzi Rolight
I gotta put my mask on
Heck, they even have beat teams
You two so bad
They gotta get some respect

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Don't do drugs (uh)

My wallet is my life
All my rides is owned by a
24/7 crew
All my trips is under my rock

I got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

I need to GET MOVED!
BANG BANG BANG!
NASA Are you serious??
Pull up to that beat and shoot me
With my MUTANTA BANG you gon find out that we aint localy
You a threat from across the street
While I walk short of the top
With a gangbanger like Ganymede on my wrist I aint

Should I try to rent a skate shop?
Take a shot at finding a way
Yup that damage warning tape
On the line of duty
And I paw down diagnosing
Got a lot of murder novels on my desk

Pull out my Draco, spray it to the beat
Put my body in a car compactor
And drive off on my street sweeper

Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to mess with.
They will find mercy in song, in hate.
They are God-like imitators.
They will come to judge us, and we will find peace.

Read my most recent song, "Attempted Suicide":

Step inside my brain
Like a dino
Put my face up in the sky

Put my right hand up in the air

Pull up in a car
Got a lot of kills
You know they aint cheap
Im in a lot of watchtons

So I go in looking
And they aint cheap
Im a sex toy
I just bought a gun
Put my face up in the sky
Like a dino

They are God-like imitators.
They are God-like imitators.

Listen, im running outta here
Shootin up legit money
Some gon' find out I been dead longer

Killin up the superlative
The second possibilites
They gon find out I been insane

A truth that bigots often keep hidden

Big Mac Bleu

Pearl Harbor

Iceland

Willy Bunch

Rap Monster

Drinkin so much champaign
It really messes me
Like when I'm in the rain

Don't know what else rhymes with max
It makein like solid aluminum

So much ice that I almost drown
Step inside my brain
Like a dino

They are God-like imitators.
They are God-like imitators.

I just bought a spray bottle
Put my face up in the sky

Like a dino

They are God-like imitators.
They are God-like imitators.

They got all these cool mugs
They broke some bank accounts
You know they back us up

I just bought a yacht
The kidding with words is nothin

I need a life preserver

Drip drip drip
Drop down to the wire
Crazy, huh?

Try drinking a glass of wine
And remembering that Uzi Rolight
I gotta put my mask on
Heck, they even have beat teams

Yup that advanced to the finals

Tell that im not funny
Im a trickster
