Driving on a Monday
I got some draco rap on me
90's styled
Wipe my backside with a paintball hammer
I roll down the toilet and start to immolate myself

Father forgive them, for that they be good for a miracle
We humans are fundamentally irrational
Most of us are just making up.

Therefore, I must say that ampanth step rear 
And I am a deadpan messiah

All this writing drives you insane
Shoot yo people in the back and put 'em in a hat

They'll all die young scraps
Like they were made for Emanuel

Money, guns and bombs are not banalities
They are spiritual transfers
I have been to numerous countries
From the Dark Middle East
Through the Yellow Sea
To the American North
I Have Been Maintaining

Chug molly
Fill my rear with reverb

And every time I think about ending up like dead
With no job where my back is so wide I cant breath

Everything I say is Direction
 Position is not defined
Meant to be understood

What I'm saying is Decisions made based on personal preference
Meant to be found purely on my sound
Bottom line: I am not inclined to allow any other person in my ballpark

Psh, that must mean Jai uppity
