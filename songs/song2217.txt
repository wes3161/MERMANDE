Trash talking some dirty
Another opportunity came to me

Ill sell you that gun and all that jazz
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with chop
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens

[b]LATINO MILD'S GIVING UP ON PC

Screamin' in the background (yuh)


Hey there kids
IPA member
I just bought some Beats
Plus some RCAO
Plus more
I'm got hand sanitizer inside my aint
So much ice I would melt glass
Disposing could stand the heat

Still make enough money to buy a house

So I should retire

I should give up dig triing
Drivin a new furda
And put my USB storage pen
Inside my draco
Showin like the Devil may have bigger dogs

I need a surgical mirror
Show myself on a cold splinter
Jet ready
Take a beat and Show me marijuana

I've tried so many drugs
I must eat, and stop taking pills

I should call the cops but I waste my time downloading
On the run I could be charged with auto theft

Wallet so bad I could be sentenced to years on end

Should I try to rob a bank and need my cash?
I want to life clone him, so I need his Terminator
I want a bigger cut of my criminal record
I need a body over my head that can take on more threats

I need some body modifications so I can shoot more firearms

I need a body for robotic warfare

You don't need a meg right here
Works really well as a body

Large in the wrist and a little wobbly at the base
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with bump
Large so bad I should rent a house
Im coming this way now that I wake up
To steal your body and sell it for something really cool
To make your whole thing superdust
Im coming this way now that I need my yacht

212 Sofa babes bleed Desperate
I need your technology so I can build a massive storage facility
Cover my bases like a jungle and hold my fat CVS

Large in the wrist and a pendant on the wrong wrist
Always ready to rock
Try to go fast, and you gon end up in the fire
Don't need a digital camera, cause I pull relatively fast

Large in the wrist and a small gold star strapped to my hip
Bees on the floor and in my direction
Roll up on yo crib and woah
And we go brat-a-tat-tat
Thats one for my wrist
Large in the wrist and a black Mercedes SLR
I really need your help
Harass my workers hand to finger
Trash a creditor in the street
All this makin' money is cause of hard work

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene

Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I need a go gety more than myRonan

Ca$h Floe and iatch
Pull in to fill
