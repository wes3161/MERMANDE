Cheplane, gunna shoot you in the damn head
With your passengers' mess drips down on the cruise ship
I cant think of any words that rhyme with iced tea

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to break up with my startypants

I could be the new Macy's, Patton Oswalt would They crack my crib Jump in the iced cracker (yeeeeee!)

I bet you're sick of my rap scene
Now you get my notice cause I keep on reppin in my crib

Pull up in a 'rari' and there it is
Trash talking Tupac expressing some of his lies
Heh heh heh he done for
This emcee sent me this play on word
They say hiphop is merely poetry
And truth is, the only truth is that sound
That leads to true happiness

Poppin molly, you misunderstand my cause
This trapper in the glove is my mask

Money talks, cause I like to listen to
Music gets the talking stick
When I flow, nothing happens

Sometimes I have to beat the stendo whips you with
You cant step halfway
Rewrite could disqualify you from the ring

Tap water tastes like codeine

To keep from piling on (uh)

End up on the news more frequently
 Laughing around as you blast
Up in the air goofing around
Poppin molly, you misunderstand my cause
This trapper in the glove is my mask
Do you know that snorting coke is more like snuggin at a pop
Nightclubbing is something like home invasions
Brata blow doughnuts at the bank

Evolving sources make for a fascinating week
End up on the news more frequently
