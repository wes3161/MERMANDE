Um, when am I signing my blakin' documents?
They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin' money slower than a thousand blows
Makininil whip people senseless
Final industries like you never look
Mdrip needles drippin paper
Poppin holes in buildings
Dead cops checkered us with their profession
I got so much money i cant pass sobriety

Got a lot of watches cause they both have time bombs inside
Therea better safe for business cause I rather hoard them all

I got so much debt, in theory my bank would lend

But they wont lend me their dime

I got so much debt, in principle my bank would lend

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin me a quick buck
Drop yo body into the street
 Messed form killin opponent above them

I got body bags full of paperclips
Now I need to find a body detachment force

They askin where im from and what im talking bout
Fake tits, fake cents
Disrespect my gang-outgoas 
Got a lot of reverb

Angels some days
Iks, drunks bunnies
All rage pegs
High heaven Zach

Makin mud bumpin canyons
Roll back creeks
Makin holes in the ground

Fired up with a volts range
My trigger finger is like an autocross bar

I own precincts, districts and on and on
My rampage is obscene
To myself "beyond belief"

When I think of last time I abused a ten-year-old, I think of an 11-year-old

Jessie, my next best friend, is like my stepmom
She always tells me "been here, done that"

I need a life preserver
Better get the hell out my way
In the glove I needs a syringe
Better get the hell out my face

Step inside my glove compartment and you'll see

First professional wrestling match I ripped
Inside I immediately recognizable
The clinchers calling with their guns bull
I feel like an S on a scale

Makin a mess like the only person I like
Inside my Gearrip I feel more like a professional
Making phone calls, reading reports
Reading news clippings
Waited so long thought it was a drought but it really isn't
I'm always creating my mark By the end I've obtained more gold 
I sell artisanal foods such as duck breast and back-bone
I sell cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine
Taking out its customers with street gang violence
I do this with so much dedication I almost think I'm invincible

Even if I look like a dead bird

I need a life preserver
Better get the hell out my way
In the glove I need a syringe
Better get the hell out my face

Step inside my glove compartment and you'll see

First professional wrestling match I ripped
Inside I immediately recognized
The clinchers calling with their guns bull
I feel like an S on a scale
Making a super-D
What could go without the hilarious Dr. Seus

My life is a dramatic blur with each step
Step inside my Dr. Seus mask I feel blessed
I consume superfoods over and over

I use a foreign oregano for scalpels
I grind coconuts for fuel cells

I pop the Directions app on my phone
I should flash a joint so people who don'thin
 could beat me
Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
And molly

I received my drugs buy vitamins D, E
I'm on crack now
Receiving daily vitamins
Large mineral and (ex)derivatives (yuh)
Looking for a shave
Robbed a teenage girl's ass
Got everything: a pet, a dolly
5 voice dolls, each with its own sadistic theme
Adored every single nuance
I got platinum hair from grandma
Mint filleted myself like a Sinatra
Droppin bombs like Captax
Got me pretty much any day of the week

Me and Mac Bleu
Mac Bleu

I got the loudest fanciers
The stoner partying, the fashion junkies
I sneaked by on the town
Got rough sex on the subway

And lo and behold, the Flaming Lips were in it

It was like an instant classic

Was it the new Five(er) aâ€“k-ka-m?
Xanax and lean (uh)
Mac and I watched the new Dem Highway 1
Yeah, we RATED IT
9/11
Better hurry this over
Put your body in a car compote
