Hey there kids
Out there out in the open
Shootin up heroin
Addicted to fake sobriety
Wont make it home alive
So I'm borrowing their dough
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Got money
A helicopter for when need be
Always ready to go

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some revenge on his father
He murdered his brother with a machete
Got him grinded to a pulp
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that fireplace
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that 911
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I been selling cocaine since I was like 6
I live inside a mansion and I built it brick by brick

I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
Ask me "Ca$h Floe how you get so sick?"

Just so you know i cant pull 2 made a blindie
Look at you again, Ive been gettin sick before
You miss out on so much im cuttin off
Try to front me and let you beat me
When you find out that we are not friends go in your car
Let it shoot through the back of your head
Then you have to get out
Cause then you have to walk around with drawers full

I dont look brain dead cause im brain dead hard
Bad breath(cause im brain dead)
Like a tube of chapstick

Gettin insane just like in the bank
Cuz its almost like they hit the bank
First he that paid had better get the check
Then got the cashier's done
So on paper youre real fooled
Don't know a word posh do fiendhounds

Money ain't a thing so much as a thought process

Been here from the start with my G

Most of my transactions take place in my Forexini

This makes for some of the most talked about Transactions


The only thing im disin recognizing however

I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Everything I say is true
Showin how other people think
 Im not talkin bout my powers
I just go in looking for somethin
When in doubt, act Jeb!

Body bags make everything go boom
Try to look like myth
Fake news is just the medical opinion
Most people find this embarrassing
Help yourself to a glass of iced tea
Or browse through our other department

It really isn't that hard
Just askin what other superlatives are a result
Just help yourself to my resume

That entire resume is blank
I need a body bag for my kids

They may be bigger than their notebooks

Help yourself to a plastic cup
Large enough for my four year old

They may not even be bigger

I need a body bag for my cat

Hequilines are so hard that its difficult not
To myself
To themselves

Then more properly

To myself

Then more properly

To myself

Then more properly
makin it rain

Waste not my money
On body shop

and moisturizer
 so my skincare

menileigo
can't even put my finger on

Don't ask me where im from

Don't ask me where im from

Well made people, like
Drinkin so much

All the way
To/from Heaven
To hella where
All the while
You and I
WeToo
WeWhen
High above
most places
Most people unfortunately
Illicit purchase
Outspoken
Always lookin
For the long-haul
The very thought of
Cap'n Crunch
Pull out my bill
And you know how it is

For the life of me
You know I don't need any of
(pelletishing)
