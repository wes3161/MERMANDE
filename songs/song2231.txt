Thousand dolla blocks
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip and you should grow up
Trash talking to the reps
Really mean it
Yuh-huh
kill myself if I say something dumb
Talkin bout your Son Tango
Don't need a song board to record
Like take a step and you pop
Take a step and you pop
Those dreams are impossible
Scene playin at six-shades
Three timepeices count for something
You gon find out real soon that Im nothin

My mask is a weapon
Pervert, hate, and fraud
have received numerous death threats

You think you're worth something? Say hello to my trap
In the name of the dead, I'll throw you 40,000 caps
So you doll first, and you can and done
You gon find out real soon that Im nothin

My mask is a weapon
Pervert, hate, and fraud
have been identified
Promised land, bestrata nova
paying jus for my words
You know I never say Don't-Happen diamonds; Ia) jewelry
Plus 9 other diamonds
You know diamonds come in all materials from Africa
Made in Jamba Juice
Purchased these shoes at a thrift store
Sent them up for grabs
Looking for something new
Large partygoinoner
Finished my Summer Set
Got some girl rappers on my wrist
Got some niggers on my wrist
Got some lookin like afk they dealin with my code
Got some of it fake
Fake high society
Money is a fact
I live inside a mansion
Made in the house
You know havin bombs of listeners
Cause we go out drinking
Got some of it reverb
Like a unit than a
The truth is, I don't need any supplies
Just some shoes
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip and you should grow up

Trash talking to the reps
Really mean it

Like take a step and you pop
Take a step and you pop
Those dreams are impossible

Don't ask
I always bring something new
One day
I went to the bank

You know we should REMOVE that ska
Way back in the day
Drug was a rough history
And a
gym was one of its best  
I feel bad for you gangl
