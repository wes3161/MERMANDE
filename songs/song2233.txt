Talkin bout bout money im running this

Out here, worth my weight (charity, tissues)
Got a lot of you
All wasted talents
Got a whole life ahead of me
Lacking the motivation
To quit til I kill you all
I bring you this, the only deal: peace
My only fear is annihilation -RELEASE

Money clip my crotices
Allardyce me with Roberts Cross
Break out your windowsapcre
Sendin assassinateés to kill
Go in choppers, cause the water must come out
