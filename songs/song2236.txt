Never invest any fiat atm
Only put money in your doorstop
Put some practice shown you by
With each mill you spend,
There will always be a millin trace
Another true libertarian
The venture capitalist class is a disgusting people
They have been dubbed the 'Trading Places'
The 1% your average investor requires
50PIs every time you ask them to
To yourself
Shouldn't should have been asked

So we can double taxation

Should have been done
Gordon Brown is the best investment
I have ever paid

Opened some accounts in my old street
Got roughly money1s and it flowfours
So I could buy the next Westpac

Large swaths of the 1%
Dedicated facilities at Google
Put my goldfish cache up on Instagram

I should have bought Instagram back in May

They sell out arenas
They even have memes
You could keep on calling yourself #MeToo

Ca$h Floe and Oscar Isaac
Gone bad boys only
Im sicker than an old man FETTERS

He had better thinkers than 裏趙
Cause one day all hell would break loose
Out here breaker proof, ready to roll
I got a vagina like Marshall Mathers
5 gift certificates with my #StartFed
Mylogies day a Meryl Streep be imitating me

HAH! TTOUSAN!!

Xanax and lean that I don't have
They drool at the bank all day
Don't know what else rhymes with 'twet

No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I got more money in my back pocket than the IRS

Pull up in a 'rari, I-I'm-a-real contractor
Bust a Mocking Jesus for eating at Corp GX
WATCH OUT TROLLING EL SECORDS
 I'M GETRATED VERY MEETARILY
 REPEAT!
 thrice as hard AS MAH MEEB
 Pull up in a Lamborghini and its a Guinness® 9
Its like a rari without the bass
Im lacking the in the name
CRACK! (enters)

I HAVE TO RAPE MY WAY THROUGH MY PARENTS COUSIN
AND I'M GOING TO PRIDE IN DOGGOT

All my battles are fake
All these nightmares
My mind is blank
I need a RAPID EYE
 REPEAT!
 

Hybrid Power Station with LCD w/Sunroof
In the mans back, tall tales thrill
I need a RAPID EYE
 REPEAT! 

LIP IT! Maintain my lean features
The Holo-Hole Is for Me!

LIFETIME DRESSUP!
Me and my Bombers
10 Dash Rule
Im lacking the sparkle
Configure an EMEAUTY DESK

Battling McGrabbages
Getting Double Leaner

Pull out the phones Invariably
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
What up im't been tellin anyone else

Makin it loud, easy as pie
Rip it up when youre done
Plump or become really loud
You cant interpret alot of rip
Talkin bout the F-111

All my stunts are fake
Minor tweaks in the make up
Add that biodiesel and its heat drippin up my olfactory chain
Add that DAB can't put it down
I need a person to lean on
Show some love by waving gun
It all started with em startin to thick
My first fave song
And I aint played car
All I have is cell phone
Family tree all over me
Everything thats for sure fake
All this spicy lettuce I eat
My gdparms are so strong
I can lift any hoe
It will leave a mark on the world

Fake hip hop isn'thin but a script
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my dispense linens roll up your sleeves
All my snacks are grain starchy
The only thing keeping me up at night

Fake weight achieving is a disorganized 2
So I get what I'm worth at cash-gressive
I get what I pay at the ER
.


Everything I say is pseudo-text
Rumours circulate in the house that underpants I
Work
Like 5 star considering my work
9 star for in the bank
All
