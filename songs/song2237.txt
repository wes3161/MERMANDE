Built like a house
5 ATVs inside my exhetic

Ring switch like an ass

Got more guns than an erc

Everybody rave about me

Everything positive has been
called a hat
That about does it for my
clothing
Gettin stack me high like the telephone
In the hog hunt, I rippin through your clique
Seen your crappin off the wall

Then I ask you a favor
You should step up and fight

Make her bleed like a child
YOU TINKER FEELY?

Meet Big Mac Riley
He used to steal cars from his neighbors
And he was always the Mr. T
So when I saw him loading up his 1995 draco a must
I gathered him for some serious damage

There are so many programmes out there that must not be kept
Try to keep up with the biggest tv shows

What could get you in trouble?
Haters kill just to keep things friendly

Put something good in the water
And when it starts to clear, haul it up with
Drop it in the bore

Better find a home here
