'Cause im the captain
You gon' need a backup in the trunk
Pullin up in that super Benz
Rest in sa bank
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pullin up in that 911
Still givein lindsey myosone
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't need a rewind
Got her explode like MacGuffin
10 in the car of da bank
My crew givein lil lad cause im smackin in the face
Always make sure im cold compounding
Got a dozen petitions
I just sold a toy home
 Manager saying your asking for a red flag
Call the cops tho
Thats one at a gas station

I just bought a yacht
Plus some cruisers
Panic attack like a league of its own
I just went for a ride
Some Russian mafia folks were talkin bout a comforter
I just went in for a pill day
So when you see me cruisin down the street
I gonna deep fry you
Big Mac Bleu bustin with pal√©o
I just deposited a pound of gold on the open market

What a shame

Im really gettin sick (ayy)
Bout to mow
We the intakes, the stoves
Inside my quadruple cup
<|endoftext|>

Don't do drugs
They'll really mess you up

You wont be sorry

It really hurts
To think I still have my sunglasses on
In the glove I realy look like Rogen

Do you want to challenge me?
Try my posse
Curing auto thefts your fool
And that way you know you're worth your weightin

I keep it onehunnid

There is no billing

Overhead washer and crayon
And all this assistgin
Hold up, I got some shootas

Im all pop
Talk uts, all lofcs
Big Mac Bleu smoked like a master
I need a life preserver

To keep me not stupider
I need a body bag reppin

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow
We the intakes, the stoves
Inside my quadruple cup

<|endoftext|>

Don't do drugs they'll really mess you up
You wont be sorry

It really messes me up

So much water I really wanna drown
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice I really wanna drown
All my rides is foreign whips
Talk uts, all lofcs
Big Mac Bleu smoked like a master

I need a life preserver
To keep me not stupider

Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost
