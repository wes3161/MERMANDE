They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin mud on the road
Don't even talk trash
Go buy some ice cream

Money ain't a five-al (uh)
No whips, I roll them

Three timepeices on my wrist
Three sex pills on my wrist
What the heck is lipstick anyway?
So much lip balm I cant walk
Hold up, I need a lift

Quit mansplaining, be broader-MEET ME

Quit mansplaining, control yourself
THAT HE SAID was all a scam
RECEIVE ME

Quit asking for autographs, for after work
Makin money all day
Rent my a Motel 6
Quit it and you cant afford the gas
Episode Over

Imprisonment without the first mention of God

10 years in federal prison for running a drug ring
Career prison, three terms
Favorite movie of my life, "Most Beautiful Thing in the World"
Worked as a small-time ring dealer
Financed murder, slept with several Presidents
Was a life without cell phone
Turned me on so much that I could practically wake the kid up

So I call into your radio show
What you realy like
Ask around, and we'll get it
Runs a strip for sale on the street
And I consume it whole
