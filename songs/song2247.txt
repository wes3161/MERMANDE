I have more platinum than Dr. Se

I could fill you with more holes than an elementary school ice-cream

What now that ice-cream?
Drop it where your bulging sphere of diced cauliflower
You think twice before filling a tube of Maxxie?

She better hope not on a 100 flying by
Pull out my Draco, spray it to the beat
Drop it where your shot hollowpoint
Don't need a magnum opus to tell people stop
So much heroin in my system, cause the output to go up

Pull up, you da'powdaba
I want your body samples
So that you may figure it out
Preferably within a week of helping me
Ill bring more money than an Academy

Trademark my way around, before you know it
Money cheer crapshoot
Money cheddar my next move
Money weight me by the scruff of my neck
Money Rante cash my checks
All this and so much more
I could go say that sitting on my kickass resume

Withdrawal from numerous bars before taking a walk
What more could you ask for?
Overpriced apartments in Staten Island
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But IÂ am pretty good at hiding
Since I moved in with my Mom a few years ago

They finally trust me
I just cant pass sobriety

They even sell prescription pills

Most of my street urchins are debt hogs

Now I must admit I think of bars
The term 'debt hogs' is a big hit
The real deal lieutenants
The politicians are finally starting to slip
Have I mentioned that I smoke?

I sure dokk wiring*
Got a lot ofmanas cluttering ducts
Pull out mink copies ofeveryday
And I smoke weed too

I should always be wary
As long as I can get by without incident

My street urchin looks like a very successful real estate developer

I need to get out of here


Three months without any serious injury 
Reportedly Steppin target autotune
Got a lot of reverb

Dislikes beaty snooties 
Shootas my peak
Reached for my purse
And pulled out a duffel

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all of us down

And I need your help, I could do it again

End up on the news (ooh)
The IRS was cool with me
And I respect that
Plus, you know how they are
When they find out you're a crooks
You Crooks, the IRS are CASHMILLers

And I need you on my radio show
'Cause I need your enzyme worms

The only thing that can bring about an end to all of humanity

Is birth control pills
'Cause this girl desperately needs her life
Turn me in at any three shelters
Or I'll crush them all
What in the hell am I doing?
We can get this mess together right here in our little home

Yuh yuh yuh
Slick Harry Potter lyrics made my teen years
Im out here blabbed like a caveman
Now I understand why so many homeless folksy
Caught on film telling the truth
My life is a fraud since I took drugs
Three rides under the bus was enough
To slip on a t-shirt and stick my finger in its pattern

Pulling in that Chrysler Pacific
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all of us down

And I need your help, I could do it again

End up on the news (ooh)
The IRS was cool with me
And I respect that
Plus, you know how they are
When they find out you're a crooks
You Crooks, the IRS are CASHMILLers
And I need you on my radio show

'Cause I need your enzyme worms

The only thing that can bring about an end to all of humanity

There is no such thing as faded gray
Im done growing up
 Everything that makes you
