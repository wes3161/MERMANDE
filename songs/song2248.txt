Im Compton, make that one home run

Three timepeices on my wrist
Im with that cold spong
Pull up, spray them to oblivion
 I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely
I’m crossing out, readying myself for war
Aim ahead, engage a cold shower
Execute myself with a metal cup
And hope somebody notices
Afternoone crawbob, I’m heading straight for your grave

My attack speed is insane, I'm gonna kill you whole 
0009

If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
Like I said, being foreign creates a barrier
That makes it almost like home

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely
I’m crossing out, readying myself for war

Aim ahead, engage a cold shower
I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely
I’m crossing out, readying myself for war

I’m even lower, below the surface
I keep on coming
(ayy)

But these days, I keep on pausing
To ask myself some simple life 
The unknown knows for certain
That I am not different from any other human being

I mean really, really, really, really, real ludicrous

To myself, that would be like saying I am a cold being
To myself, that would be like saying I am a crypt
To myself, that would be like saying I am a crypt
To myself, that would be like saying I am a cat
To myself, that would be like saying I am a half a brain
To myself, that would be like saying I am a quadruple
To myself, that would be like saying I am a triple
To myself, that would be like saying I am a quadruple
To myself, that would be like saying I am a quadruple
To myself, that would be like saying I am a quadruple
To myself, that would be like saying I am a quadruple
To myself, that would be like saying I am a quadruple
To myself, that would be like saying I am a quadruple
To myself, that would be like saying im not that dumb
To myself, that would be like saying im not that dumb
To myself, that would be like saying im not so bad
To myself, that would be like saying im not so bad
To myself, that would be like saying im not so bad
To myself, that would be like saying im not so bad
To myself, that I should get out my trash
I really should get razed
Quietly staring at the sky, I say hello Snoring loudly, I say hello
Shout out a saying all day long
'Hey there! Say hello better Wolf'
Brush me keep calm and talk
And dont attack me with anything

If you would like to ask a question
Ask in english
In Japanese
In Japanese EASY
I got you
The life I live is pure joy
You can eat porridge too

I got you with me
.

From start to finish Processor
Every step of the way Im like (wonder)⁰ "
So much ice skunk 
I need to melt his (bread)
To sow doubt he will (lie)
I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely
I’m crossing out, skimming his (stick)
I give birth to 4 grown boys

Produce 4 grown like them
And 2 like me

I’m almost conquerable
Turn my brain to soup
Relax, I'll pass you by
And I sound like an alcoholic

Xanax and lean (K)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (ci)us
Straight up reverb
So much water im bouton (tupac)
Add that EEPROM

Anyways, they need to be with me

'Cause a thirteen-year-old may not be his
Daijios ras-jeus excellently
I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely
I’m crossing out, using dairydrocannabinol (cyrill20)
To bring about my daily accomplishments
Add that bluewater
To calm my nerves
Speak bring true flu
Low self-esteem
Low self-awareness
Low motivation
Low results
So much ice skunk 
I need to melt his (bread)
To spread doubt
I’m ludicrous, rhyming
