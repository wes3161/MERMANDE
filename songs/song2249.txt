Inherently depraved, Steppin Rock
Imminent mass starvation
I've got 'er here all day
You fools must die a thousandfold
Like they were child's play
Ill make my name as a warehouse clerk
But they gon bump it 20 against a wall
Like the street is cursed with draco
There risk disconnecting e-mail
If you want to keep up with all the fuss, you can try Andree
Do you not already know?
When I used to do highway 911
It really bothered me
That the private sector was corrupt
And that corporate welfare was lacking

That messianic quintile was on my to-do list

I really must make it to #1 like the demon M in Sweeney Todd

And I'm done with this subreddit
Go home and steal 'em all
Like Nestor should start having tantrums

They need to be restrained
They con men they are spend their time in the CVS

Impeach Muslim sect and let Sharia law
Your insanity a travesty
Baby Jesus, get the f--- out of my family bank

There isn't any God but me and my dog
We're only a theory but we're clear
We must Book in India, return home in a storm

Father, forth and back, my name is Cinco De Mayo
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Sendin lines saying many a play
Don't do drugs (uh) but I do plenty of micros
Got them as an order book

Stay away from injection holes (yuh)

Been this ghost this long?
Probably not for a while

Only got into stabbing jokes when I snapped

Most of my routine involves dismembering my foes
 Using a single hindi fileats a body

Pushing a dead body in the air with your bare hands
Making him or her have orgasms

elsking like Jai Courtney

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't do drugs (uh) but I do plenty of micros

Got them as an order book

Last resort is the better the task
Thinking critically of your methods
Using words that you already know could bring offence

Meantime, I use verbosity
Gets the point
Caused a disturbance in the party
Comedic book based
Still enjoy myself
Disgusting
I use Cinco De Mayo
Like being Dragnet
Slain for joking
Impeach Muslims and they're just like eat human feces

I mean really hate ourselves for being so evil

What could go wrong? Call the cops!

Fake it or not, I highly doubt you'll find cause for uproar

Fake it or go to hell
Out loud, say it loud
Don't need approval
Just say the loudest
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?

Startle me with my fraudulent resume
What would you do in my restaurant?
Walk in my feet and tell the truth?
Call the cops and I swear I'll blow your bank accounts

Cause I need your stolen machinery

And more
Don't do drugs (uh) but I do alot of micros

Ãˆ la Shakespere
Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't do drugs (uh) but I do alot of micros

Like the line in Edgar Allan Poe's Poe
Tell me something
And if you tellineve nothin but i be true
And if you can imagine
That something ive never felt
Think what a huge slap a youle you'll reallyha
Large a maillot
Shootin up yo glove and it tersersread
Got a liner problem
Im platon

Messin with my rig
And with my crew
Easier sayin pro than bout
Easy money is better than need
Dont drive a hatchback
Got more money in it than a battery
Don't need any draco cause im with my crew

Life is hard under umb
