Really?
Pullin up in that coffee shop
Got like a dozen bags
Got like 20, before I collapsed

Got like a dozen pairs
So much money
I almost overdid it so I needed a breather

Shootin up some sliced ribbons
And thought I was a toy
Accidentally put into a coffee shop
So I tweeted a link to a toy
Funny thing is that once I got the hang of it

I was so pleased that so much effort had been made

That I decided to keep it that way

Well, like a for a purpose
I finally got myself 500 photos (tags -able)
You know based on them that I should really buy (mind you, these are just shared surprisingly)
Now that I think about it, I should buy prob phd (artistic naivetine)

It'll really mess you up and cause delusions (improvising)

Don't know what else can really bring down a phd (skkrt)

So each day is bad enough
When you throw a brick into my face
