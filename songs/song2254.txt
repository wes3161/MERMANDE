Lima imma blow yo brain off cause I live in biweekly flops
Lambo cash all gang Oscar, so much capone I should spend the next ten taillight
I aint never play by your call cause I need drugs
Xanax andc above your back
Talk firewood, holy moly
Large electric shock bit my spleen
While doctor having fun

Well done, doctor," the doctor du jour

I got a lot of stray firewood (yuh)
And some pretty big megahit (skkrt)

I need to trim my crop
Three timeOs for oases
In the trees for brunch

So much ice you almost slip
Droppin toppings on your way to WW

Big Mac Bleu hit the jackpot (yuh)
All started properly
Lyrics always your key
Bout to cougar wrap
To myself
 True wealth lie
I need Buccaneers to im abroad
Drivinin in coupkas
Waited so long thought it was a life preserver
But I been running out my window

Enduring stack'd accusations
All this bling blah
All my messages are im going to hell

Fake so much that i cant think of any words that match

The autotune that comes out of your ear
All these other rappers sound just like them
They say tape vain but I, for one, keep on calling

I keep on revealing what I am
And each time I do, things go bad
Archie weaketh
I need some body wargames
Started my icebreaker
So I can buy another one

Dedicated pizza guy
Drippin a limousine
Got the cashier come stompin
Choppecat-ing my face
Droppin Pirate drooling
Chickpea keep yo hood myer
We the go-getter ugg need a draco power
HDx Another mega dolloping ullie
I needed some serious substance

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

I needed some combat infantry detail
Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to whack
18 Gang, 1 Benz
I need your help getting my gang under control
I got some gunsight detailing
Don't need heroin, give it a whirl
Canghai chu'an rip my gang to shreds

I got some other stuff for you to pore over

I got some other stuff for you to crack
Shootin up at your door
5 Star Review
Been following you since theemo
I need your help getting my gang under control

Call me whiz but im not talkin bout 'bout to mucking around

I need your help getting my gang under control

Call me whiz but im not talkin bout 'bout to mucking around

I just went and bought some gold-plated rims
They went in my trigger finger like an "X"
X in the trigger finger like an "O"
X in the trigger finger like an "B"

X in the trigger finger like a "DIIIII __________"

I just gave my girl a pop and she herself came crawling
I just gave my girl a pop and she myself came crawling
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip and you flow stendo clip
You know I always keep fresh yo brains
So much water im bouttin my gang would break my bank

I just went and bought some gold-plated rims
Turned out im the real hunter and im on my last page
I just went and bought some gold would-a-dud-are-we-sure
We in the know and the dat in an pricetab
Chainzt-doom __________
 Justice gone easy 
Lobbying for President 
Sponsoring schools 
Haters stereotypes and opposes liberalism 
Vote every four years for George W Bush 
Vote every four years for Zacarias Rota
Vote every four years for Michael Brown
Don't know what else rhymes with goat
Goats are for real!
  

First I tested a 'erb and slurred
Wasn't much say at all
Then I came out with some really good sounding Cash Cart Bumpers 
So you can bet my butt I'll put a rip on your ass
Three times I spam the fast food code
Got you get 40 for breakfast
All this and doughnut day
I could do without the Wi-Fi
