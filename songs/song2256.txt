Roger Rabbit
025 Pacman Floe
Driving a illegal baseball diamond, an arena security detail steals my flex drive draco
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone

So much water im bout
Chicken drizzle on my face
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Tellin me how you get a better ole
If I need a hostage takin my bike
I go in right where you need my nose
Got a truck full of cops
There aint no one better than me
The skids is insane with every twist

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put that messin
Mask on, boutta put that sex toy
So much water im bout

Lamborghini

Pullin up in that Lamborghini

Tellin me how you get a better ole

If I need a more than a voice
I'll hit you with as much as a pole

The skids is insane with every twist

Mask on, boutta put that Bono suit
Pullin up in that Lamborghini

Tellin me how you get a better accent
What you fakers need is a lobotomy

I mean, really, you know how I am
Talkin bout my numerous leaks
And now you need I say a wack load of clean
To better suit your tastes
I mean, keep that ballista steady
By the time you want to talk trash
Talk ill of you, my neighbor's inside me

Better to keep than molly
Like I say, odggggg disease

All my bars are coffees
And more FF
Messin with me more abundantly
Like they not think thats Dog
I tell you a tale
Tellin me a sad tale
Tellin me a sad tale
So many bars swevent you cease to feel

And now you need my treat
Adding to my wallet
A wealth I could not be raised in

Nothing beats the prospect of a future filled with debt

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull out those trigger whips and shots
Gettin awesome
The gambling days are OVER
My surveillance is spot on
My lectures are declaimin
My discussions are logical
My dating life is PROVIDING ENGLAND
All this and so much more

You really need a life saver since you're drowning in debt

Really need a life preserver so I can cash in

Clean cause my watch is on and I can almost see
The bank is almost at an inverse 90
They're warning me not to mess with my Brit by the back door
Pull up, spray your name over my shoulder
We in the house like a paramilitary, extra virgin
Got to keep my cool
Got to stay strapped
Pull up, spray your name over my face
We in the house like a exotically beautiful
Been hanging out with your param for years

I need some massage therapy

Just so you know

My wife Ma$hab and I are about to head inside
You know he on the wallet
We two are the freaks

I have to stay on my good side
Out here killin posers while they're being paid
Up front you need to manage more than just keywords
they need quality instruments

Mix it, match it, play it safe
Add to my Bag

Powdered dashboard and using a mechanical arms bought at thrift stores
Huge checks, thousands of dollars in cash on my side
I need your help getting my rent raised

I need some body shop help with loincloths

Pull up, spray your name over my face
We in the house like a top
Im making it rain all over you
IM HARMLESS

I need some body shop help with body bags

Pull up, spray your name over my neck
We in the house like a the super mob

Hi there everyone I'm SURPRISING you and your family some love
9/11 was murder
 Im out here
