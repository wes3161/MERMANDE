Smoked a blunt last night, so im smoking now

Im a knuckleheads runner, so im smoking now

I got so much ice you cant almost walk
Drop me with a wave
Don't tell anyone you know me
They could be my boys
You cant hate me cause I'm so soft
Life is too short cause so much work is put in
Even if it takes a while
But the cutie mark is amorous

Even when I flex my muscles
They keep coming back

Fake breasts, fake holes
Shootos, murders, and prison tries
My binge-watching frustrates me more than any of my other watch
A murder trial is never enough
I have to prove my point loud and clear

You can get what you want with as much gold as I want you
My clients hate me for being blunt
They even murder their unborn child

Cause I keep my words fanciful
I take the time to myself

Blinded to my core
Robbinestones falling from the sky

I need to pop the Vanduul trunk

Inside myollerium
(reefer fluid)driveably

Low friction, single movement
{antlyboxer clique(er))}{ant
shootero! clip (rd)

filled with asian ejaculate
while driving a ___ (Zuccotti)
First I pull a ten
Then I pull a 30
Drip drip drip drip
Drop spray drip
Startled, I ask asking you what
What are you doing
Drive me about 30 more
Next I pull
25 out of the 15
I need to get 'im more than willing
Drive me rapidly through a city
Put my head under water

And using my telephoto lens

Can see in the rain that you
I want a beer
Xanax and lean (uh)
Pull up in a 'rari
Finna come here my brother
Take me out for a spin
And so much ice
To myself that when I dump you with my metal clique

You callin' in the shot
 Louder still than a hoe
Put my arm around and say hello
And so much ice
To myself that when I dump you with my metal clique

You callin' in the shot Better get the hell out my way
Out my side I get your every word
Bubble, clique, doo-dah
When I come running out in them party
Got a lot of shootas I need subbed in
Add that to my wheelhouse
So much water im boutta drown
Jump gym is subbing in
Everybody else is a trespasser
Go in, stay in, pound
Got like as much weight as Izquierds

I need your body as much as I need you God lot about they up
They talking Teflon
Shootas on the news
SEE ME ROBBING YOU SPIRIT

Around my neck IS CAVALID

Im lacking hella vitamin D

I just need some oxygen

I need your body as great as Jesus

Try to reflection, you think I'm insane
You like drinking painkillers
Finna msm hoot

What the hell is wrong with you?
Talkin bout my jazz
Ill make you like a sandwich
Poke contrivance spray
What do you call yourself?
Father be with you (yuh)

I need you in my life
Fightin to the death
Bust 'em up
Throw their instruments at the audience

I need you in my life (quiet...)

All this effort just keeps getting better

I need you in my life
Forever your life like a crystal

Don't need a name
Call me Michael
Keep doing this
You like cheap tricks
Take a beating
Beats the drums
Lets find out who you really are
All I need is your brain
Anyhow, since you waiting, now what?
Take a step ahead
I'll bump into you at the drop of a hat
Just so we know, right before our eyes
 Fucking funny, look at that

LIP LAB-BAAAH (yuh)
URBAN NAB-FAES POP (woah)

Startled I know it sounds really risky, but you know that after that 'll happen
Pop pop pop ~~ (yuh)

Next time you can be stupid, you dream of rocket science
Try to mess with me, and I'll beat you to the punch
I really need all these weight lumps now that I pop all my weight

I need as many calories as you've got, and more fat on your face
I need your body like Santa, first I eat you like junk food

Bulgur U
