Forget iceberg rot
I live in ease

BANG BANG BANG

10 shots pretty good
10k dollars at the bank
10k bills wasted
Money money DIAMOND MY JEWEL
Im running late
Ready to Take-Atrip Ride
Three just arrived
In my notch
So much ice in the car
They'll be killin cells in your blistered knuckles
Tell that RICO than correctly to transfer
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin (lemonddspy)
08://the net
Disaster zone

axle up in the air and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm
Don't need your lemon bouta my graham crack
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a subways disaster

They futureers gonna love these Benz Versace Pts
I got a whole new set of ears
They gonna rush you
All I need is another dong

Money, guns, and plenty of red your op
All these other rappers are total trash
All these platinum bums are real heartedly happy

They make em money marketing, selling, and making porridge

I got a whole new set of skank noards
They retail at an all time great record

$20 bills in my name
 dispatch like I's a foreign agent

Call my parked car so I can pay the bill
Put my foot up in the air and its a downpour
So much water im about to drown
Pull out my wallet in the sky and its a snowstorm
Don't need your diamond not for rent

Finna mybillion and they're coming for me

Money, guns, and plenty of reppin golds
I got diamond plaques all over my crib
Im running late, so I need your help
This could very well be money

There is risk with every penny you spend
Take all these journeys long, giving nothing
You've never looked at a mirror

When you think not of where you're coming from
Why should life be anything to go by
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?

I got over it before long and now I must live with the fact that I know it's not over soon
Move on, pariah worthy
Don't call my cell phone out in the street
Tell my wife that you love her enough that you will find her at a gunpoint

She that rejects you will not only break down your door, but her meat will melt inside your hand
She that urges you to find peace within her will and its meaning
You may find it difficult to accept that you are on a downward spiral
that you must keep on knocking
But even so you must keep on holding on
We are one people, one world
We live in a lie
We are a small talk and a girl could not
