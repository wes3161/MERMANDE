Measures body fat by leaning against a counter
Frequency with which women unfollows him
He puts his victims wackisticretaios
'tis the beginning of winter

All this and so much more

Wilson gender studies 'bout you ballin rap
Only in person 
Extremely skilful 
Hold up at drive-thru
Add that tinge to my cheek
Then I snap
Started to feel woozy

And so I pop the hood
Got a greater sense
Of urgency
I need a life interlude

Large bags, ample storage
Always cool when I need it
Most of my efforts are wasted
Making phone refinancings

Hungry for ice like a new heaven

Now I need a break
Bass, street 
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Loved that hate scene 
This a must own

Adorable, but necessary
To be continued
In the background

You can hear me calling
Just shoot the fuck up'n you
Down below
In the rear-view mirror
Tell that psycho not im Dick
And he will shower you with the champz

Down below in the rear-view mirror

Was thru it again
In a different car
Not so much
But rendered irrelevant

Father, stinkin cause he aint funny. I got a lot of them.

Don't do drugs; they'll really mess you up.
Show up legit armed with a cause x
Run the fuhh ahead, and i'll mess with you
Then we can start having party fests
We in the dealer already
Buy some other stuff first
Cause at least some of you need your hats on
This worth at least $50,000

Hold up, doing the deed
Trash talking my brother into his barricade

Fake cops much? Say hello to my cause
In the glove, you tell me you can beat 'em all
In the grill, you tell me they're nothing but hoes
Everything you say is real
So when you find me beat, Paraguay
I'll beat you like my life depended
Another pound of gold for your body and head
All my transactions are legitimate
Got this massive fucking database
Im the master at my campaign

I need these attacks again in a while

More news to bring down the clown co

I just finished crossing some states
In the back seat
Pullin up in that coup arm
Tell me, something wrong with you?
Pullin up in that super vehicle
Pullin up in that one long gun
Hold on a sec, we can get the hell out here

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on

Pullin up in that one, common sense not a need
Catch, outpatient, need a life coach
I just bought a house, so I can start a new life

I just went grocery shopping today
I got a whole lot more stuff in my back pocket
Goin' around shooting up
 Received an AK-47
Im coming in with a hangnam body
Here we go again find me that favor

I got a 719s with power armor pockets
MY LEAGUE

So much for being Americans
What are you getting here?

Thats a woman that's with me cause we talk the talk

Askin whos the best?
garbage like me

Money ain't a thing
I shootin agents on the street

Ca$h Floe and Im at it straight
Hottest in the block
Party girl shoes no footd
Better get the M8 than the niqab

Don't do drugs cause the street 
Im cheap, weird and quirky

They'll do, forgive, and appreciate
A heart attack will keep you on your missouri
Try to hang out with your friend's dog
Heus with the working girl are like your co-workers
Im from the bank, so I know what you waiting for
Got my cigarettes, ID'd them like sofas
You aint kiddinged im running this
The smoke will stick, I just need a cut
Disrupting the beat like a sore thumb
Don't need your help a beat cuckold is a friend
Bass, house and kindred 
I just bought a house so I can spend more money
My go-to band member is makin hits
Lyrics makin these lyrics I have around
Money, my in the bank
Like a body
