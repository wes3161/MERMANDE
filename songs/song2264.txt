Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat

And put my cents in the liqueur trusts

Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
