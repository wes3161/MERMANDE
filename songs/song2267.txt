Haters always hatin but I keep it real
When im playing hide and seek you like duck tills
You can always come back
Delicious foods on offer

Large cash cows Alwaysices ON BEHALF STATEMENT

Remember that Tirisfas are real
Rest in Lil Peep

Big Mac Bleu
Blindin people with my rims
They even went as far as to steal my purse

Now I must admit I think of Tirisfas more than a name

Large cash cows Alwaysices ON BEHALF STATEMENT

When im playing say hello
Large cash cows ALWAYS GET THE STEEL !!
WARD!

Cash cows Never Mail 
Large cash cows WHENE MEET THEM YOU DIE TO TOO Much

Pull up in a 'rari, loaded with guitars
Pull up in a 'rari, got all these rap beatographs
I live inside a Rari, so I can buy MONEY Watches NOBODY GOING IN THROUGH THE SEALERS WERE DANGERING OUR WALLE

Got so much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got so much junk you almost Disappear Behind THE BLASTARHEADS
I want a swimming suit so bad I need a life preserver
I want 4 legs, like AT LEAST THOUSANDS
I want to pop (endlessly) all over you, like I was a telephone
I want your on-the-fly diagnostics (FAST) (yuh)

Plugged in, hooked in, dead simple (no emissions)
Alex Jones is the new news anchor for Disrupt The Power
Are you sicker than a Bavarian? Get some vitamin C
Just because a North Carolina church dares to speak its mind
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
If you want to win, you better hope not to end up like them
What would you do if you had to fight? walk down the street and die?
I don't need any commercials since you already own the technology
You can build a much calmer house with less waste
You could be on my news feed and still not realize it?
Well, at least I have my RSS and some news sources
You can keep on competing if you like
I use bots in my campaigns that I know you won't like
I use paid translators on my comedy videos
That way I don't end up on the wrong end of many thousands

Well, at least I have enough money for my airborne 'rari

If you want to be a big fan of my parody of pop culture, you have collected all my tweets
why not help me out by analyzing my lex doc
I'll start with the lyrics
Like, autotune, reduce
Blind, repetitive, use words you learned in class
What do you need that you wont use elsewhere?
So you can be an engineer, you know?
Plus, you know how they look when you touch them?

yea, that pretty much says it all

Bout to movin more weight on my back than a tumor

Don't think I need a mechanical skill enhancer
I got some pretty good ones for you to look forward to

Large muscle, big goo
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
To kill, you need to massive
Pull up in a 'rari, loaded with pacas
All my rides is foreign whips
To kill, you need to massive

Pull up in a 'rari, loaded with joggers
All my rides is hollow point
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the tatra
All my rides is massive cohort
To kill, you still gotta got steam
Grip, gaskaapo, syrupy
