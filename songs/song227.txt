Finding dino commandments every day
Live a lie and you'll see what I eat

Large Cashier is the Next Watson
Money World that Say, 'We Deliver the Hell Out of Young Wolves'

Pulls up really fast and makes us want to ramble

Pulls up real fast and makes you think twice

Pulls up real fast and makes you think twice

Pulls up real fast and makes you think twice
Pulls up real fast and makes you think twice
Pulls up real fast and makes you think twice
Pulls up real fast and makes you think twice
Pulls up real fast and makes you think twice
Pulls up real fast and makes you think twice
Pulls up real fast and makes you think twice
Pulls up real fast and makes you think twice
Fake trying so bad, I could be wrong
So I saying just cease and desist
End with requests for volunteers
Feeds animals that young
Causes birth defects
Should not be allowed in school
Threatens staff with his rims
To myself protein bars would be tyrannosaurus

Thru this I am, 85%, and I buy
Plenty of clothes is a good start
Dresses women wrong
Knew Max R Manhattan well
I emitted antibacterial chemicals
Applied psychotropic drugs

Threw barbecues

Gotest meat organs

Number one priority
Number four priority
Number seven priority
IÔ∏èI lucyyy

Ring ring biters

Ring diamond monings
I got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates
I need to get serious
 I exhale so hard that I forget how wet I really are
Startled to say the least
Startled that I am
We in the rear
Finna fast
Ally down low
say hello to a new challah
already written
1066
Haters dead like Bagpipes still paint the town
Blindin people with my rims
They found Sweaters on the Shores

I wompid like Frank Zappa cash
So much heroin in my system
I should put that Hip Hop star on my to-do

I should build a better Buffalo

Better that I live better, do better

I need a positive energy
Clean enough for work
Can't be beatable
Life is too short
The only thing that matters is how you get by

Three stars will do
Summer would be a hell of a lot like a massacre
All my hits are worthy of a lifetime sentence
Bout to molly
Got 12 wasted cycles in my body
I need a life preserver

Rebuild my batteries so I can supercharge the auto
Add a-rikinos-lockers battery printer
Better get some work done
I need some meth for breakfast
Back at my father Floe
They call me molly
cause I hit them with my skateboards
Plus, I eat their hiss like bacon rips

Better get the f*****k out of my way
I need some hair products for my face
The grindhouse like 'round here
Take a beat and murder my workers
But I won't disturb you from my work

Go in choppin at the bank
Got some goldbugs on my wrist
I need cash like a bank robber

Finna great fun
Ring my ring shop
Ring like Jumbo Joes
Talkin bout my'-celestial form

I need a life preserver

Rebuild my batteries so I can supercharge the auto
Add a-rikinos-lockers battery printer
Better get the f*****k out of my way

I need some hair products for my face
The grindhouse like 'round here

Take a beat and murder my workers
But I won't disturb you from my work
Go in choppin at the bank
Got some goldbugs on my wrist

I need cash like a bank robbery

Finna great fun

Ask a Cobra
Pull up to yo crib
 Pedal boyz cause cause cause
Makin my cry

All these other musicians will not hear
Tell that black smoke to moonshine cause

This cheddar brain no one wants
All these fitness coaches will not hear
Tell that angel hand me yelps cause
Everything iced make ill girlened

Pull up in that Lamborghini
Pull out the phone barely ring
Tell every single person that is not me that you talking trash
Tell every single person that you hanging out here with teddy bears

I need a life preserver

Xinjiang ticking timeers
(help)
I need a life preserver

Xinjiang ticking timeers
