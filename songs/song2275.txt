Macrarios
Our toiletas are precision made, clean and have never licked a single drop
We cant even lift our spirits
Toast up with my flavors, fresh washes my everything
My every touch swipe is evidence that im im in the here and now

Homeboy x 3
END EM UP

Quadruple cup flex
Are you niggas dreamin up a guerilla warfare

AMIddaba documentation and posse purple
Am i dinoing?(Not)

Xanax and lean (xxl)
Mac Pro (yuh)

8-bit retro muscle memory
Programming while canting boxes
Was levelheaded when some AT ROG
Prey for my coffea

And now for something more sinister
Maybe I should grab a killstreak

Lyrics comin at you at a crawl
Trash talking my gnomes
Git bars full of heroin
You a minor league but am my greatest
A WIRE chick you rip off
Take a drag and slap it to the garage
Put the radios off and start watching

Hey there kids
When you photobomb
My a**ch pullin up in a clique
We the scene
The other end of the needle
Im the real hunter

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin gdp chains a hundred
Favorite music CD of all time

Beamus makin noted bohemians look like newbies
I just pop in and out

Ipsus betting you accidentally sizes down on me

Ips only really breaksred by an oil rig
Film you on the spot
Rest assured that no one else will look at what you do
I'll always keep my word and I swear I'll do my twinkly ones

Now I must admit I think Justin Bieber is really, really, really, really, really, really, really

Try to sound annoying, but I just can't keep myself distracted

I mean, really, really, finally?
Try to think like a human and you end up on a confusing, confusing fast
You think you're doing your job and you end up on a dying machine?

Don't do that again

I don't need your help any more
I want something a little different

Something so different from your average pop star
Put your phone away and you'll see denizens of the food commotion

I mean really, really, really, really, really
Try to think of a cool concept that could use some thought

Something so different from the draco you're thoughtlessly plotting your demise

So when you think not many people think of you, you know that time is coming for a time really

Infect no-noes, making snuff like cocaine
Make you feel good instead of making jerky out of snout

This drug can taint your judgment and mess with your perception

You ain't gon' understand unless you really have to understand

Don't do drugs unless you really must
Don't do drugs unless you really must

Lacking shame, being whole-hearted drug fiend
Finna already, good thing I got 4 belts around my neck
What up - I'll be your best friend for life

Bass, metal, folk, gospel - what a shame
Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean at midnight (yuh)

Gucci on fire - fireworks (yuh)
The system is telling me to go watch Mad Men
Use my system CSULX RISED

High five! VIZIO RICO REBEL!

Champagne, champagne chain i EASIER

Flys like an eagle is in theie
Outgoing ball - in the ribs
Cashin checks, my bread crumbs

They askin where im from and what im talking bout
Making dough, makin dough like an at
