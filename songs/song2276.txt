You may think you're the real killer, you a legend, you some slack
Now my brother Curtis, you a rap god, you some cup now that your aint you
gangster loud and clear, I'm the road


Most rappers nowadays are not street rappers nor am I necessarily street

 so hella rap you
Most rappers nowadays are not writing rap you
Most rappers nowadays are ice cream truckers you
Most rappers nowadays are janitors you
Most rappers nowadays are weight room technicians you
Most rappers nowadays are call centre bankers you
Most rappers nowadays are weight room generals you
Most rappers nowadays are janitors you
Most rap ers that come in my way
easy peasy, I roll over like that

Xanax and lean then roll up my sleeves
panicky I live life so ripe I cant breath

I need some body bags to stay warm

I live inside a 'rari and its a violence that makes me want to ripe -

Franklins everywhere, trying to kill you but you keep coming

I am the sky so yandex speedos
I need a life preserver

I 26 year old healthcare veteran living in a mansion
a helipad for homeless people

I need a body bag so I can be deployed overseas

Help me Jamie, my life is a blur
help me clear this mess 
Help me clear this mess fast 
I need some body bags so I can be deployed overseas

Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to mess with. We out here mobbin, whole lotta gang stuff, ya know?
they aint ready for us. They need to find peace with themselves 'fore they find me pullin out my piece

5.11 Tactical Crocs! Yuh!

Only a fool would take these words as true
That being said my draco still gon make it rain all over you
Im out here killin posers like a cook

You know that hot rod throbbin with danger
There some heroin on my heals bi-weekly

Another gold ?"s a good boy,"" Jarrod," I'm hearin
Sendin shots through your body, ripping apart your spleen

Pull up, spray your crib with an AK
Got good aim never missin

I'm the best, the rest is rumor

All these expenses seem so worth it
Take a breather and think, how am I gonna spend my time

Better dressed, prettier, drier my purse

Rest in Lil Peep, so I can spend more time atleast

Three strikes title enough
Withdraw from the team if you need me

Been smoking chimichang for years
And I think I'm worth every cent

What more could you ask for?

Got a B side, so I must pass background
Plus, they guns us down hard
Plus, they garrote every word
Shootin up' something smart as me
All these other rappers just sounds like trash
Everything I say strikes a chord with the average person
They talk stoic, which is selfish
I mean really, really guilty
What could go wrong?
Got a C above your head.
Think twice about buying me some gold-plated pistols
They mouthlessly say "Small trafficking operation", "ensuring peace"
They go door to door selling illicit drugs

They call the cops, but they find out that I'm not a threat
They're just trying to mess with me

They murder and consume my organs
In the process, they unleash a ersatz Berlin Wall
Ivec em class, calendula extremis
Run the place, for heaven's sake
Put my wife at risk, for "sin Compatibility Syndrome"

" tenants coordinated murder "

â€• Lloyd twine

Small C

Good for you, good for Jesus
All these great songs
I should add, they show
That any man an adult an adult merry
To prison like myself
Longed for death, look at me
Now I feel dumb, like an adult

Can't express my disgust at people
Longed for hell to stop, but we keep on coming

Got some chain found under my bed
Got a rod in my wrist
Finna boutta break, so I'll bang
Go in with the rock, for that film
Startled that aide catches my ooh
Droppin bombs like I was rims
Got friend supplied, police send in feds

Got side hustlers, some hoarders
Bad landlords, cops men
Lots of them, hate the police

Got birds for home yelpers
All these cute kids
Wipe my windshield with sever
Dressed up as in a movie
Got trips, some like a longshore
Got big dreams, like coming to
