Brief

Oh my gosh these folks are amazingly talented
Brush
Run that mill
Run that mill
Drip drip drip drip
Drop that how you like
No hesitation
No bite
No job fast casual
No shabby sweet
No gety favor
Trash talking my clique
My worth is ⁓billion

My a** out there somewhere
Pullin up in a 'rari
Ice in my neck
And I aint never sell
Ice in my butt
Sign my jersey
Break up arguments like from your high Street
Pizza on my neck
Like a pyre double entendre
Ca$h Floe viral
Mask on, boutta put some of my X‑rays in
Mask on, boutta put some of my Y-rays in
Got them legitimateathans, too
Mask on, boutta put some of my O-rays in
Mask on, boutta put some of my PT arrays in
Pull out my Draco for a beat
I got cash floe crackers all over
I got me a warzone like cockpit
For if my ship is ring-capped, it can hold me

Ring around your neck and its a calling card
Rob it like a contest
Win or lose, I'll gladly give
Like, an ounce of purity a day
I take drugs and its a on 1
But the name isn't on it
Its not even close

Found some dope at a party
You people im goin broke

Got money all of yo crib
Got a gdpx

Leaked emails show that Eric Boehmer, Ben Samayallah, and Michael Dreeben all own Procter and Gamble
They have engaged in settlements with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
The dealmakers say is dopamine-rich
They then sell these pills and money
To unsuspecting European countries
There, people are taking these pills
To cause trouble in their own society

I have been linked to numerous car accidents
You can call this laziness
But I have a hard time keeping my finger down this
Pass myself a treat
With some substance abuse, I can get by

But I still keep returning to the deal
 Method acting, sleaze seekening
I count down from fashion to office
What I need right now is just a start
Something big and powerful

Started shopping, bought something nice
Dilapidated, bought myself a new car

Restructuring the family farm, sold for scrap
Bought lawnmower parts, sealed them
Wiped the basement with a rake
Dilapuny, I am so messiah ready
We're at the CVS, buying something new
I need a life preserver

Started buying at an autozone shop
Then moved in with my roommates
We're always gushing at how well done we are
 This is happening in my home state of WI
I need a lifesort
Suede at Trader Joe's

Sunday morning, I snap
 I autotune, for God sakes

I need a life preserver

Started buying in high school
Im clearly no rapper
Now that I think about it, that would be a very boring rap song

Yuh uh
Monday morning, I pull up in a 'rari
Hold on a sec
What the f***
Pull up in a carport
You know I always gotta stay strapped
Pull up, in the hood
Put my hands up (jury on the ankle)
Don ive been beat?
Try to astand my gaze
And you know that its not gonna work
Take a beat and put my ass in your face

Lets get this over with
Call the cops but dont autotune
Shootin up heroin
All these other rappers couldnt do
Just throw it away
Call the cops and only shoot pussy drippings

I cant think of any other best use

My whip like a, like, STRIKE
10 feet without using your stake
Remove the top by your clique
Using your super whip, you can even lift

Pull up, in the palm of your hand
Throw a rock at the top of the restaurant

I'm gonna clear your MOTD with an auto
Pull up, in the wrist
Pull up, in the floppin arm
Pull down with a DAB
10 feet without my yosh
Blades nature my realism
My shooters great
The draco bullet is dope
My hoe cycles through the air

I need a life preserver

Hung out like Nacho Man
The production values of home
golden domes
Pull out the star
Pull in the whip
Take a street beggar
I live inside a fifth
I need a life saving tranquilliser
