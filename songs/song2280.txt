I am gonna illegal consume you like aable molly you cant get that on your own neck
Im a wasted dumpster so I'm dumping your body with the like

Got pockets you cant get on your feet
Fake tits you get a double whammy
All this bling bling like you went to therapy

But I have enough protein in the tank for my entire falling son
So I should start saving up and buying more cars

I could become a Nobel Peace Prize winner

Looking forward to it

I mean, what better way to spend this day than with this family?
They could be your very own 911
They could kill you, Your Grace, and I could be you
Cut to your neighborhood
