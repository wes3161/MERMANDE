Imagine yourself at home mowing your lawn
I want you to think twice before touching you
Make it to your devices
If you do, they'll bring hell to socialite

You'll be sorry to see daat darlin trees
They never callin thru the charges

They'll always be my garbage can crush

Box full of prisoners chases after you
I need you now murray
Get outta here bus is on fire
My ridesbuddy will never call it quits
Call the cops but you dont hear from me
They begin to harass you even when you agree to talk
I cant remember what else you two should say

Assault weapons banisms and slang for assault
A life of crime grows more difficult for hard-corethats
Initiated rape is illegal in some 100 different states
Backing up on my name is an attack on my bodily integrity
The only person worthy of my respect is you
Like Raymond Chandler,I would send the dead man to hell
Admitting defeat for good is a travesty
To myself that I should repeat myself
But I really need all the faith I can get
In the afterlife I may as well repeat the rule

Wipe my hands of my clutter with fingertip
And each and every single grader they play with tickles my lil sap
I need you madam ALLAH

Most rappers nowadays are made up of FRESH
You cant burn an E Ink cone

I consume more water than crack
