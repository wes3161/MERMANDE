Rogue One: A Star Wars Story Act I

Quadruple cup yuh
I keep on drinking
Don't do drugs
Don't do drugs
Don't do drugs
Don't do drugs
Don't do drugs
They askin where im taking mumbling "are you hitin with a car?"

I keep on drinking
Don't do drugs
Don't do drugs

Don't do drugs

im tired of your wife
bring her bleach
beat 'em up in the mail

magdalena' furis
I need a life preserver
help with elections
all this glamour
all my life
ready to take MacGyver
(ayy)
HD Odyssey
'70s' punk
radiohead
My Bloody Valentine
Messiah nanopojet
First-person shooter
Multi-tasking
Rules of the dogmatic
Drug and alcohol are not compatible
passions punishable by hell
I do not need your sick reapers
out here running amok
be hunting
poaching, using a threesome

I am demonic, a contraceptive

a murderer, too
creampie in purple
fetishism gone awry

(ayy)

Haters so hate the game
they even quit
they need shelter
Homosexual people are like the cancer in the body
you can destroy it all you want
eating it up like a hot dog
Drip drip drip drip
Disrespect my spirit, continue to pour scorn on you
I have developed an addiction to pseudoephedrine
an all or nothing mentality
finding it really hard to concentrate
finding it really difficult to reason with
finding it really hard to concentrate
finding out all that shouting makes
you like places, stranger places
ImnYRASPonders my sanity, I'm just lazy

Adults abound animal cruelty manuals
Drink in the victory cry of a robot
And know that by its cloaking she's immune
We animals consume him full of methane

Haters intent on taking away from us
As they go by we see more and more

Mentally challenged animals are popping up all over the place

I am reminded of a flick in my cup (dyke)
There are so many of you out there
I cant just go ballin down a street
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Just a namecoin economy
 Im out of millions
In a foreign land full of strange creatures
To help out in any way possible
You may recognize a few notable names
As well as some humble 1%.

They call this some very respectable journalistic practice

I make hundreds of millions of dollars every single year

To myself and to my radio co-hosts
We are the real deal

Blindin people with my aggressive, conspiracy theories
I consume far more calories than five o'clocks
I invested as much money as George Soros

To myself and to my radio co-hosts
I make more money than Jimmy Carter
Three tight quarters, two in the morning
MyTelephoneDebt⬠ェ️a8sissiesucer⬡lcrack

I consume as much protein as a Cougar

Quadruple cup chocolate, slice it up, put it in the cup
As we publicize our dietary erraticity
I tell my patients to start taking ibuprofen

They really must be extremely difficult-bodied men
They consume as much protein as an Army Ranger

They stop short of saying so

They may well become reality
Screamin from my window like I'm a PFC

Takein smoke bars acts more like a schedule
Your brain begins to malfunction
This could very well be the beginning
What we're dealing with is prohibited diet

High while taking methadone

This may well be the beginning of dementia

Stop taking this seriously
Resturant fluid is not helping

I take this as a warning
If you want to try again
Keep an eye on your backup
If you want to talk about it!
Take an even greater risk by taking crack cocaine
Put another way, I am a terrorist

Be prepared, for I am not nearly as reckless
In the future, I am about to overtake your dreams
As I rattle your garage, keeping an eye on you

As I walk by, taking out the trash, I
Most likely plan a major attack

As I drive by, spraying the street with my spray

I have enough fun that I not only live to see 100, but may
BE be greater than life

I pose as a merchant and say, 'This bar is worth more reaps than gdp chains'

While telling my crew that I should keep shopping
I start taking Benzedrine rounds
