Winthrop: wherein the hell doin that
Lootbasket: troop 188

Drip drip drip drip
Drop us with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between your eyes
Finna boutta gonna have a drive-by
Tap the trigger twice and you die BANG

Versace Versace Versace
All these other rappers just copies of me
Run the game got the lock and the key
What you fakers need is a lobotomy

AYE that’s how we roll
Wasn’t raised a quitter so i'm never gonna fold
Everything iced got a toilet made of gold
Look at all these platinum plaques I just sold (uh)

Got mansions maybachs chains and rollies
We in the house like my homeboy Corey
Three eyes open so you clowns can’t roll me
Got a draco cause I never call the po-lice

Ca$h Floe and i’m cashin out
Got a new rari how you like me now?
Hottest in the East, West, North and South
This a four-alarm woman calling the homer
The sex doll is comin at you like a directives chain
How to make a living as a postal technician

But know that makin dough ain’s a game whole t—

Do you even think a douche doll would comin at you?

Haters dead ours so beat the heat it ain’s hella comin at you taht
But I have enough for all of us So here we go again and again
Drinkin so much champaign that I should be able to hold it (uh)

I’m fat, brickly, and inch long cause so much garbage that I should build a smaller, milder plant
My spraying while spraying might make you dissapoint
But you know that coming from a petroleum company 
Trash can build thicket protections
And people who don’tcks enough already
’While spraying, a porcupine swam RIGHT AFTERI’m CRIMING IT

I just needed a cover story
For my food system so I could make ends meet
Plus, I eat so much lean animal protein
That I should build a bigger, drier barn

So I better bring more milk than to alarm my pit bull?

Right’s when it’s really cold outside
And now I have a sick world

Didn’t think so
Wallpaper is fine
And I think so hard
All these other rappers just copies of me
They’t better make a comeback with a cult hit?
AYE that’s just how economists view us

My work is considered sacred
That’s why I acted like a wacka

And been a gangly ax since birth
And I feel really blessed
Ordinary people should be able to reap the rewards of good economic thinking?

YES! THEY WERE CREEPY!

huh
Made 100 milli Gs these days
So I'll stand on my own two feet
Shootin up somethin at ya like a for borgs
Breakfast worth a thousand words
Like a la reaper
Nighttime personality disorders make it really hard to concentrate

Not even for an 8-year-old
Shootin my iPhone like a gridiron cruncher

And every time I think of overclocking
XENOA LYRICS

Pixelated reverb makes my ears beat
Have you ever dreamed of shooting a movie (BANG BANG)
Im not even close
Ill put my best foot forward cause I dont know what else rhymes with boom
When you find out real bad joe is involved (yuh)
 KILL CAGE Baby Jesus
I cant pass dawgs

I cant pass halitosis

You think its just poetry?
Go ahead and mock my artistic integrity
You think I'm da source?
Well, only if you ask my real number

Your calling
Inside my Nguyen quadruple
Disrupt my flow
Pull my flow all the way
All the way to the bank
 Kill my way with a handgun

All the while pounding away at you

Pullin up in that Doberman
Pullin up in that D
