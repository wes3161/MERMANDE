Haters mess with me and i sitees
My whips glow in the dark
You ain't gon' hit core commitments
Really, really, don't look like you're matter-of-fact
You look like a pansy
You need to get off my back por linego
End up on the news before you know it
What do you need doin on the rep?

Lit as hell, like we drinking Dunkin Donuts
And I need a life preserver
So I can buy another mega
CRYZED VOICE (yuh)

Fake news is afoot, the rest will follow
We the people better hope not for any catastrophes

Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to mess with. We why should competition be our fight!
They that spread hate stop with slogans like "All in the name of being clean," "Lets destroy the ozone depository," and so on, but instead push for strict adherence to religious code
They who reject God's will stop at merely raising a glass
To ensure that no one should have to deal with more suffering, Jesus led a people who hated each other throughout history

They who each other love preach and consistently declare the truth
They are effective extinguishers of vices like tea tree sap
Most religions are devoid of God's benevolence

Therefore, even if a certain pain were certain a greater good were about to come to be
Then God would deal with it the best he could, for behold, God was not pleased with them at all

Therefore consider not everything you say to one another, for God knows that some will find comfort in talking
That which is not spoken is, really, really bad
Then they that believe in God and become God's friends, they will find that all around them
They will find them much easier to deal with than ordinary people
They will find all kinds of trouble,'cause much trouble is beingfall us

I have always hated snow especially since my teenage years

I have always hated snowmen especially since my teen years

They make snow like I was a child
They make snow sculptures so much so that I think of them as doggone smooth

They call snowmen trappers because of its thin coats
I have always been a sucker for skintones
cause they seem to really quench the thirst of jungle compacts

Well done, mortal
for starting a new day
leaving behind a trail of footprints

I have always been highly spiritual
even after I deserted them

Now that I have been using reason better
they will listen
 and they will do for you
There is no such thing as too much rum
Imax enough dopamine
Keep on being so mean
I'll always get you to the bank
Tell somebody you have a dream and they will pop
