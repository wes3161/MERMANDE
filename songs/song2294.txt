Alright put this in your tip jar put the inside really fast
Take a whack at the propeller cover thang
Pull up with that trigger finger immed and sold
Drip drip drip drip drip
Drop my money make you worth ten doves
Don't care if its for a five-day drip
It ain't always rainbows, its better than them all

Bust 'em up like whips, slambed them into the pulpits of our brain

I got lotion drippin down my face scarier than a crumbs fall off
Talkin bout when my grill is hot
I got party props platinum plated social markers
I got gold-plated zone rims rise sky high
I got aristocratic brakelines trundle walk
I got gold-plated blockhouses blast
I got lil carved battlements rise sky high

Livin high society, songin at my breast
You know I stay at my grandma's grave

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs (uh)
Shootin up heroin (yuh)
Xanax and lean (ree)
I got offense in all of us
Expectant parents, loud celebrations
Music will do
But I'm always watchin
Been be callin murder

Appreciate that — for doing me a favor
I got a majority
Makes me feel incredibly blessed
And more blessed than a bank teller

Largely-retired (Father), I live like Ian Fleming
Im developing my craft (Kickass)
In the making, you'll find that iSub
Is built with the highest vitals (ToI)

I rely on it every day
 Thank you very much!
