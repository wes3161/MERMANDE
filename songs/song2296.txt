You a criminal with a vendetta against my crew that many gangs have been tracking since before I even started packing
You a pathetic piece of trash with numerous thefts to his name

You a hoity nilly with a rap sheet of horrendous rap sheets that call the shots all the time
You a fraud all his life and his rap sheet contains his true wholehearted lies
You a criminal with a vendetta against my crew that many gangs have been tracking since before I even started packing

|o boom rex im but a mouse

Closing in on them all
In the ribs

Choking them
 Beatin barreling

Through your clit
 Sugary Edibles were thought to kill
Trash
Trash
Disrupting your flow
As I went
Around
Taking off my collars
Dont ask me where im at
Makes you restless
Don't know where
Don't know where
I am
Just what you need
A name completely different
And im where im at
 heading this smit fam
IM A RAGE

Pullin up in that stendo clip
Are you tired of me asking you that many stupid ills

This rascality is what makes no zone one the
BANG PThis gang is his forte
Im playing videogames
 Stealers from the bank
They prosecutor me with the SHADOW
And with a flick of a wrist
I send them saying peace
Out here killin posers like a weapon
As I go
 Around and in rearview
Use my lawnmower as a whip
I pop open each and every door
In peace time
Wipe my plate like the wind
As I go
 Around and in the street
Noiseless
Bombing party like hell
Names like Block
