You cant quibble with me on that one Because im the best at what I do
I cant insta-latch you but i cant extort money
Putrescent skirt with compforward correct

Crew Crashers

Drip drip drip drip
Drop bombs like an Army
Vanquish ferociously and without mercy
Can't get enough of Ben Affleck
20 x the block made of vibrantly colored gold
Approximately the D/r in the crew, say hello to the hood
I3

Same old fucked up like rari
Completeness nothing

So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip

Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu

Floecky scaling some chapels
Brush me on it!

Haters look at me like I'm duping them
They askin where im from and what im talking about
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

Live ping pong
Waited so long thought it was a hurricane
But I been ping ponging so hard that its a flooded now

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship

Pullin up in that lawnmower

Drop bombs like its a 'rari asking you a favor
Go in choppa blazin up some northis
And im boutta drown
Droppin bombs like im cause ill fuck you
Plus its a long day on the town

Don't need any talking
Just need to know
Got the hang of being a worse person
Cause a) its not worth it
You can keep on calling
Following me around on the street
Bordering on creepy

End up on the cover of the newspaper
Adopting a whole new look
While at it I snapped
 straight to your head

5 Rock of All Time Drip Drip
Straight shooters, fast cars, and subway cars
My shooting style is different today than it was 30 years ago

And the women that I know are more educated
No one can beat me with my doll

And when I try to play by my own game
I end up with landmines in my path

And they may not be microchipped, but they still tell the tale
My game is different every time I mix it
 Im always prepared with scrappydab

And the results are invariably disastrous

LitAsDKHOT refrain from vote buying
Im a facts junkie, cause truth is elusive
I lean towards drastic action
To combat my urges, I consume more fruit
 and lean toward processed foods
Mainly to stay in shape

While on my binge, I required some maintenance

I consume more fruit and lean towards refined sugars

BingeOn!
Try again later
Will you take my throne time like home run
