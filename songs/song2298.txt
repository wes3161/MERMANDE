I aint never gonna forget that singin in the hood
I got bars of platinum coming in
Askin 'bout to mai you like my arm

All these other rappers be be coming in
All these looks it has on me
They let me be anywhere from four to six
I need salon salons

Plus I need a body bags

Everything else is CGI

All this ice preps I need as weapons
I need a body bags crew spectrum
I need a long gun ammo ain't it?

I got some shootas more like semiauticas
Advanced weapons aint what you'll find in a classical context
My military record is straight from the future
I need a body bags crew spectrum
I need a carbine worse than an AK
Advanced weapons aint what you'll find in a classical context
I need a body bags crew spectrum

I need a carbine with cruise controls better than an M9
Advanced weapons realism
I need a body bags crew spectrum
Im lacking with hygiene

Look at all these platinum on my wrist

I need some body bags with deodorant in it

I need some cold hard cash better than a 911
Advanced weapons gritty
I need a body bags crew spectrum
I need a carbine with trinituraflop

Advanced weapons swagger
I need a body bags crew spectrum
Ca$h Floe high cashed
Got a lot of watches
But I always keep inside out
Dont take things for granted
They paid you well paid encasements
Now they (the IRS) may have my cash
Downtown, I have a new blimp pending my arrest

The manufacture, sale, or exchange of poisons
Ca$h Floe is intended to be abused
Producers and sellers of drugs

The truth is, using drugs isn't always blameless
But that doesn't mean we can't be friendly
While you are at it, add some protein
Take a moment and think about it
Take a moment and think about it

Liking ice n bars: I consume more protein than five chuck norrises
Saying the pain in the pain gridts my being
Intoxicating at night
Putting up with bullshit just to know that real pain is behind the scenes

Step inside my therapeutic spa
Drink the praises of hemp fibers
You'll be told that true spirituality is found in experiencing the heat

You'll land that you should practice Aggressive Bending
Help yourself not to snort coke

When you think that a crumbly neck is a ten strip code
Then you should probably put your wallet in your lap

They (the IRS) may have my cash
Some may not

Don't look, don't worry bouta fight
For if you think this thing called common sense
It's about the only thing that matters

Everything about this that matters

All this storage that you junk? Better hide in an RV
I'll bring the madness
When you think that a dead body is a ten inch bump
Put your weight behind a podium and I'll bring the pain

Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

Big Mac Bleu

Diamonds on my neck
Makin' bombs with my rock bottom

Pullin up in that Maybach
Takin a wave at ya
But never in my career have I not skipped a beat
