Do you want to challenge me or not?
You don't need to be a hipster to determine that a certain mindset is necessary
I get so much hate for this on the street
That I'm taking offense

All these other rappers are disposable
They could eat us all up
When they find out that we are real liars
They'll do anything to get us all this way
