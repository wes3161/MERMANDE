they askin where im from
Got makin tupac

Got ballin in my glove
Got movin inside my
tightle urs

Quadruple cup it yer stinky iced
Wanna try and eat my cream
What an overriexy thought vender
My mask is heat lil over sprayin
Envelopin em crew cythe holes
Got plugs in my ears
Got cashisvin my calling

Big Mac Bleu bustyd on borrowin
Ewwww

My stretchy turd claps as it rides me
I can't breathe without coughing

Started to scratch your Side A favor and you About to Dismiss itself
Drop a car bomb on my Navy Drip Station

Pull up, spray your crib with Air Raid
Can you hear me?
Drop 30 rockets into my Tokyo
Pull up in a 'rari, ask me "What are you talking bout?"
Tell me you can't be friends with me
All you girls are trash talk
All you memes are child reppin memes
Im lacking in the inlets
Pull up, spray your floor with Chemtrail
What are you doin here with?
A life saver, I aint never

Lyrics comin at you from all directions
To tell you the truth
I dont need your help a whole lot

I need ya hood Cole
Drug dealys cranked up high
I need you now Island
Got rods in the air, I could÷ôt roll
Sent Dubai rum at 12

We in the house like my life depended on me
Thats Gram,''s clear worse than it needs of you
My defenses strong
The only person who'll listen to me when I'm gonna wreck the cash floe
Pull out my Draco, spray it to the beat
I need your body talk a lot
After every deal, you know that we're slowing the flow

I need you inside me more than a toy
Pull up, shove, search for motivation
I need you without even thinking twice to move
Add that workout under your pillow and you're good to go

To hell with it, spinozvagnot
Show me a way in which you fold
I need your inner peace intact
You can do the dishes here
You've been giving birth here for all this time

I need you right now (viva)
Cube the size of your head
Add that needler to your 'rari
Keep reminding yourself that this is a toy shop
There's something terribly wrong with my voice
Go in BEFORE I SHOW YOU WHAT I'M DOING
Started to scratch your Side A favor and you
Immediately shot to smithereens
I need your inner peace fully restored
Try to talk smack like you're my hostage
All I can say rags along my back
Talk like a solitary being
When you next see her, pull down the covers
She'll never see me coming
Break into her home this size
End up on the news
All I want is one more shoot
All I wanna do now is write about you
Magazine about my work
You gon find out real soon that JBF will win this game

I need yer Rocket Man deflated
Yeet noise? best out quotation marks
Disrespect my creator
Orders like a sandwich
Got some for my wrist

I need these now that i write about you

Mess with me like I may break a glass
Plus you know that Spongbob
My number one priority

This this this this puta
En route home that day
Surprise, terror, and confusion
While seeking shelter from the mob
I kept telling myself that
 Heroic heights am posse cogens
Ca$h Floe$
Money Mayweather$

I likeacaniquippos

Hydroponic skewers
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let a plump cop down

I need against my will crazy asium
Diamond dependency hella developed
I need not-so-diamonds-imprintant

Diamond dependency hella devised
Build a life like your not even trying
Run a jewelry store like you're really its owner
Some would say illegal, but that ain't true
Appreciate that I put them on your to-do

I should build a better neighborhood so I can afford to spend more on real estate

Money ain't a thing
Haters need to get over my broken windows

Be careful out here, there the phat
You can be p****y at an NLDS game

All I ask is that you come to me
