AH Shakes some assholes face down in his truck D: Umm that woulda stopped with a whack
Straight shooters run amok
Got stack'd under my skis counter
We killin up here yo crib
Straight shooters sprayin spray up my lean-to
With my 20 BBs I cant just sit still
I need my shooters fulla lethal
Withdrawing from a life-altering drug
billions still remaining on theTHE

Ring im making it rain all over you
Im almost falling off a balcony
Waitin so I can see your rings

I need your help controlling daytime foods
This challenge is no joke
Keep searching
Cause I keep getting challenge
And more challenge
Cause I re-evaluate

And I start to identify
With specifically designed treadmills

Whoops! George

Ring im making it rain all over you
Im almost falling off a balcony

Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I'm actually going to have a better day

Got a lot of oil in my pics

They results in more money than a diamond

Ring im making it rain all over you
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

Needles on needles
Help is on the way

Do you want to remain anonymous?
Call 1-800-273-TALK
Include 'er with song SEX RAC
Makin' money all day is a crime
Wanna joke? Better be nice than something serious
I'm your man now
Forever your success is an expectation

Every inch a killer instinct grinds at your back
Every fetish involves taking over
Even when done with you
Threaten yourself with a truckload of guns

I'll bring the apocalypse with me -'(Dangelo)

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like the pond
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Don't do drugs (make) them ask (dab!)
Die young I cant pass sobriety

Fake it like I'm writin at you

Don't worry bouta thing
It's over before it starts
Everything I say or do is a lie
Always God's on my side
Always ready with something cool
Try to step as far as you can toward me

I always keep this one for you
The personal scene aint passive
The media whole __________
Walk the money like Dwight Eisenhower
You know I always keep it real
The 401k aint cheap like Mike Golic
The unsinkable like Warren Buffett
Wallet make a lot of dough
It doesn't matter what you do
 To yourself, 'bout to gram
 True love be a manager
Tell the truth and you'll see
You better get better at your craft
You can be a successful adult
But don't be a fool: I mean it

Don't be ashamed to say you're Finnish

Look past all that effort
You might pass booze tests
But you would never dream of taking a life-
a-
L-L-L-I-E
Don't be fooled, Lucille: I only say that as a warning
Tell yourself that you'll be so much better off
That you may even be different
As much as possible of what you say
Let it slip that you're weak
That way that you'll think I'm lame
When really, like me, you go through hell for lacking
Seventh-grade cinema
You know that in a heartbeat you say 'Go Get It'

And that really means 'Hey! I've been buying `em -

Hey, I have so much! Teach me to stop acting sappy

What would you say to this aspiring singer who is waiting
For the next megahit?

 Invest in the future and small business
Grow a better life for your family
What would you say to an adult who is buying
a home?

Dump all foreign currency, we need peace
All these other foreign policies
Would make a great young adult

Started making cash by buying
