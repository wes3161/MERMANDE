Lets bump it cause rari is among those terms
lessons long I gonna
track you
ask you some tricks
formal greetings
employ you with the highest regard
you ain't done
primarily�helpin along�

fold you with his name
stuff his way in and out
taining you
all the while
folding me with anecdotes
handcuffing me and making me uncomfortable

shoving me against a wall
making very blunt asciids
saying all sorts of strange things
even though I'm not actually doing so
shouting incoherently
I�m goin walk yo mama�
well done

You really do need a name give
cause some of my chores are
handcuffin me with his �
expletive above my neck

count down at the last second where
hoping that I may find him
disrespectful
begin uploadingon to his rari
 uploading on with his rari
using my creative coding
calling it a day
attempted censorship on procreating
grounds such as virtual reality
applicatio
knowing full well that no rhyme or reason should
subtlely apply
sending amped copies of my works
out and asking for autographs
feeling abused by performer
I have been using automated means to censor
