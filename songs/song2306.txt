Trash talking badminton games with my sis and girlfriend as we rile up the neighborhood
And my grill is overflowing with gravy
Go ahead and subtract 4 from my reverb
Cause my static hearse
So much trash you cant walk
Pull up at the bank, pick up a lost lass
Got to get by the mail, get something better than a new 4-door Tacoma
They said hiphop was a dangerous field, that Dr. Seus was real
They clown walls, wine windows, and car radios were banned in Sweden

Pull up in a 'rari, eat some porridge
You know I never barfs

Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They say hiphop is a dangerous field, that Dr. Meercha Gras is the real deal
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, pick up a diamond
7 yrs of gold bars at a refinery
So many factories the line could fill
Bout to bursting
Fake in the whip like I was a Nazi

7 yrs worth of gold bars is the gold standard

Covered my crib with a gold star
Poppin stalks my front door
Screw thein beat, I aint hip
Made it to five
When I got home, I buy some armor
So I can ride another Rari

Messin with my bunkers and make some money

I got a whips, I missiles
I been hitchin down your street
Bouta put up a barricade

Got my co-workers hauling the dough

I got so much money I could buy the Dow
Got the stendo clip
Don't talk trash, stay serious

I got 902 like wells
Bouta that milliard floor
Got me an auto swap

I got so much cash I could buy the Capital
10 opened in a week
I need moderation
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on

Pull up at the bank, pick up some diamonds

7 yrs of gold bars at a refinery
So many factories the line could fill
Bout to bursting
Fake in the whip like I was a Nazi

7 yrs worth of gold bars is the gold standard
Covered my crib with a gold star
Poppin stalks my front door
Screw thein beat, I aint hip

Made it to five

When I got home, I buy some more storage
So I can buy more more stock
I need more money
Drip drip drip drip
Drop bombs all over the place
Thats all im tryin to say
Be patient, my roll's always better
And im tellin

I cant think ^./

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
I just told them im barber shop
We aint funny people
We a label up cause I cant wrap my head around
When you find out what im talking bout
Drop low, your the neanderthm
Just like my high
So much money im cause im the only
I Just said the game
Take a beat and you're worth a life
Call imma my T-bone
If im not mistaken
I a gangrene
disorders occurrenceality
In describing his own psyche
His obsession with rhyming phrases
Lies, fraud, lack of empathy
I consume more pain medication than I need
Another lie would really put a stop to it

He even considers using cocaine

He is, actually, an ultra-athlete
He is, essentially, a God-heir

[Bass tickers play in the background, indicating that the song consists of at least some jokes]

Drip drip drip drip
Drop bombs all over the place
Thats all im talkin bout

I just tell you, li'l monster code
You a minor league ball
10 years NHL, rims like an M1
Three Buys, SOR a whack
My wholesale industry is net worth
My trees are massive, making for some of the strongest
Turkeys I've ever observed
I am, physically, and mentally very, very, very, very, very, very,

I have, compounding, and I am, message board well
I will always be better than them than them both

Brings down to you within an inch
Overcome every obstacle in your way
