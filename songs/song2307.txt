Wonder on your own, with someone else
Finna boutta gonna have a ball
Like a long street,
Got bars of gold strapped to my face
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies, each day of the week (gang gang)
Poppin molly, you know i never sleep (no i dont)
Got money, money money money (large cash)
Straight shooters, you know we we aint funny (kevin hart)
Your girl need vitamins, i give her sunny breaks (nutrients)
She aint your girl, if she coming home with me (large cash)
Number 1, hottest in the street (heatwave)
Lit as hell, like we drinking gasoline (exxon)
Pull out my Draco, spray it to the beat (gang gang)
I’m always cool, but I still bring the heat (goldbond)
200 thou, for that Actavis (codeine)
I am so loud, like an activist (large cash)

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between your eyes
Finna boutta with Fed` 'er fail
I have to fill you with too much ice
You can say that again let it rattle your His it don't need my help 2
Drop barriers make it flat-out immiserate
Funny thing is that the rest of the crew 
I have with me every day
(Drip drip drip drip)

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff (codeine)
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I keep coming back to you nick
I’m incredibly rude and flippant (juicy)
I explain my numerous rap swine escapes through words so crudely
that even billy hooters would resort to such insincere words
As I ascend from the descending steps I keep clapping

I have to build a massive, great asylum right in the middle of nowhere

I’m a fake, and my real name is Mazzy

Blindin you with my catch phrases and ops instructions
All my sold-out R&B acts live and die by hear me

I’m literally the only street artist in the entire United States nota killer

Wait cause at least one of my cars is a 2014 Lamborghini
pistols spills out in my path
I keep coming back to you, with hot coke in my system
I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff (codeine)
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I keep coming back to you, with punched glasses I feel like pop
I’m a savings and loans department goes broke
I keep coming back to you with cash, like for cash!

Livin high society, my cronies are always on the telephone
Tellin me your slipv vish my rent is the other way around

I spend real money on clothes, shoes and crew spurs
When I start to understand that im renovating my life
innocent until proven guilty
Started my own radio future and now play music (vacation)
My four-year-old daughter is now in her thirties
My rent is obscenely high (Now I cant afford it)
My biggest caffeine robbie is 1,200 milligrams
My mattress is like an eco-terrorist's lair
I keep coming back to you, with caffeine in my system

AddictB thought I should encrypt my every move
From social engineering to sex offender reppin
I need to put an end to this totally abnormal business

Im a psychologist, engineer, juror, and truth teller

So much research already shows us that clique brain matter
Im the real killer, tons of research in the book
What do you call a brain tumor?
