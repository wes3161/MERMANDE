Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Take a beat, and steal someone else's flow
But they gon bump it cause the cover say its cash floe
Drive a lambo, glovebox full of bands
Dont drive a toyota because its made in japan
Downtown, people asking bout my cheddar
Brush em off, I dont deal with no beggars
Gettin paid, you know that im legit
Drivin on the wrong side like im a Brit
Cashin checks, my crib is like a castle
Like Spongbob, you live inside a pineapple
Covered in red, tellin people its just paint

Lick my droid's at will,I gotta use them as a human resource
As they age, they lose their desired taste
Predator codeine, I'll eat your brain off

Carry on these blind activities, you know that we are true believers

I keep an eye on every step of the way, and merely let the challenge bring
Child abusers into their lives, I'll work with them to the death
Adults need to step up, be themselves
They need to socialize with each other more than you need
They need to overeat, lose weight
They need a life of leisure
They need polyamory with a ices partner

They brag about how much they love them, they should stay true
We another take home Paypal cheery tellin them its a


I just sent a clears my that its a flood
 Im done with this

Simple as that, now its a penance
So if you need any more poetry, you better write

Father forgive them, for they know not who they talking about

They will not stop at one word but repeat
Number one, do not hug any aenys nor touch any courts doors
Do not wave any favor, for they know not who they talking about

They will not stop at one word, but repeat
To all of my lovers, at least my smart as heck
I keep it one secret

I keep it one secret from the angels
To hell with it
Out here killin time
Help craft a better tomorrow
Forget all the pain
To myself I say hello

Be a better person, for that is what love is all about

When I am with my people, I teach them how to be better
I have a great life, for they know that im real
They immerse themselves in my products
They call the cops when im doing a great thing
Orders for my chain of childcare centres
Bought the treatments needed for asthma
Im now a household name
My voice is purer than a prostitute's
I use every painful drug imaginable
I consume clear pain relief
In the throes of addiction, I gain greater wisdom
I have gone so far as to say that death is on my watch

Now I must admit that I am blessed
I suffer greatly from restless legs
What is wrong with me?
Xanax and lean (uh)
