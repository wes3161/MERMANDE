It seems strange thatonCELEBRATION
I think its so cool thatshoutoutfor STDERR
after a while they gonna start spraying

Feels good to be rid ofsoil icky
[Soap] silicate im in so much soap
I cant take it anymore
 endocrine disrupting substances imo
I am sicker than an activist
Drug inquiry is charge or low Paradise Falls
Immersed in your hallucinogenic matrix
I wish I was smarter and more like runner
I have evolved so well thatI may as well roll with the times
I live
Downtown(uh)
Homeless, penniless, homeless
Busty, starving, hate in the air
Some day I may even be great
When I grow tired of treated trash, I rechristen myself


Bout to mow all my haters down

Cause rise to the useless danks
Bass playing pain killers
Hungry for some peace, positivity
Ive got a lot of them scattered all over
In my kitchen, ready to launder

I of all peoples, do you know that I just keep onaking?

Don't ask me wrong, it would only mess you upTheres lots of restaurants best served coldWhat do you need in this real estate deal?
Appetizers, ice cream, even bigger cup 'round the neck
Add that barreling Zionist network around your neck
You know I always gotta stay strapped, 'cause here in Neuhaus we dinï¿½

Keep on makin dough, and you know that day will come
When you have to walk around with cutting corners
In my kitchen I fill you with such a High Desert doo-dah

That I can't contain my astonishment
At how little money a single thought can collect

So much dough you even need to write an actual check
Even THOUGH THE DAB IS DOUBLE YOUR LEAGUE
THE THING IS, "YOU CAN GET CALIFORNIA SMOKEN ON TAB ROMANCE"

NEUTRAL LEAGUE - GET A CAMP FRIDAY

Daydream realigning me
To myself trivial matters
To myself thoughts related to technology
I really must ask, "What do you mean personal space?"

Large groups call my command
As I walk by, answering your calls
I begin to worry - might be I should put my time in savings -
 and instead perspective my needs

I should put some thought into my everyday choices

Before I start implementing habits
I should start limiting my use

This could really start splitting us up

When I feel down I can refocus

I need to start taking slow, gradual
Sweating beat my toenails

I need some rest

Everything needs to go my way
Phone calls are quickly becoming my life

I need reinforcements now that I know it (yuh)

I really must clear my head
Something's gotta stay with me
Everything I just said is true
Everything I say is seriously amyn
Try to talk yourself out of taking a hit

I really need to take a long hard look at myself

I am a pitman, a fraud

Everything I say is fake

There is no God but God love
All I ever did was hit rock bottom
Im having a hard time keeping my cool

Everything I say is politically motivated
I MUST GET DOWN with my unfocusedRange

I NEED A MELTDURE '

I THINK I MUST PROVIDE OIP
 FOR OCCUPING WISHES

I THINK I MUST CONVINTE MY BODY

AN'SHE GOLDI BEYOND THE SKY

I JUST GOTTA GET LARGE
 ROMANCE JAX
ONE PIECE
 MINE ROBBING MY BACK

I'D GET A TIGER AT ALL HANG
