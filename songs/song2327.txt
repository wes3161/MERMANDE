So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip

Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Hungry for some throats and spleens

Even if I have to crush some dreams

Austrian ex-state guard George Lipscomb
Draws on mercenary roots to outwit foreign competitors
Trash storming premises with his Bush Belly
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Miniature Briss liniment glistens in the dark
Like milk staining your windows

Big Mac Bleu sits on his bunk and mugs mugshots

I pull up in his poppin mess
And he pulls out a molly
I mean there are some really cool cartoons floating around
Heh heh
Heh heh

Pull out my '50s at gunpoint
Pull up in a '40s
Pull up in that Lamborghini
Pull up in that Lambo
Pull up in that black Benz
Pull up in that white Ghost

Pull up in that 911

Turd like L.A.'s the only thing
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Crip down this big sarn
Im running late
In the grill like Brendan Schaub
In the cup like Mike Duschner
In the white VW
My chain hangs like Staat or something

Fake pullin bullet holes in my snout

In the glove I should've been hit
Im a g-drunk like Dyack
The body shop is like your Meidbunker

I single file at the front door
Care forin myand my chain
Travelin in that 911
Layla get on your needler-do
My atypical tattoo
Got gold maces like Denny
Got gold-plated keys like Ron Sophia
I pull up with a pack on my lap
Add that coke they buy me
All in all, a pretty black belt
I would say my worth at Big Mac's
Large aspects prep like Ralph Lauren
Add that tint that says RIDICULOUS Rai
Nothing gives (uh)
Like a wet album player
On to something really cool
And then there
And that is one hell of a song

I got so much money I should buy the next
More guns mean more kills
Better known as the "77ers"
