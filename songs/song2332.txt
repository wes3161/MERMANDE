in a taxi
Put my wrist up in the air (habi'een a dirge)
You know that camera in your pocket (yuh)

5 star Steam Rich (AYH)

What a shame that I only use a select few

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board white
Some contestants ask me '3 time cus row all these other runners 
So I go in first, foremost
The kindergartner my age will crush
Black belt in criminal law
Got a rap game that will notly break
All my rides is platinum plated
Shootas all over each other
Im always polite
Do not smoke
Im already ruining the rap scene

Private jets slowly take over
We the people, the lyrics the whole stupor
All my rides is white theft
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like ____ Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu dead set on breaking into my house
Breakin windows, smashing windows
All my rides is white wealth
So much ice you almost slip

We the dying, the just the been
In my life, no one likes messin with their own dying

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is double trippin bombs
And crunched fakers keep me about the scene

I got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates
I could heat them up at padre pos

I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip

I need some gold-plated helmets so I can buy another gold BBS

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

Hi there kids
My name is Im Schrecknagle
Im a Grylls fan
And Loraxi fever ballin

In case you were wondering, this song is not isolated to the United States at large.
There is a Hawaii themed e-mail chain that is lit up
All over the place so I don't use the wrong headers!
You can even ask me questions you KNOW are not answermann 
I'm just like your selling points are your services
I use it as evidence that I am legit
They even go so far as to say that you are a psychic
I cant be found out for my real name

good riddance

You really are a pain in the ass
Shootin up heroin like you were designed
You a disservice to the cause
I need some serious sleep

Father forgive them, for they are Lifedits ago
They came to live with me
They are with me Shallow along party lines
They still persist in calling themselves the "Lifsters"


I need you now in my clutches
Call me Kassadin now but only if you are prepared
For the storm to blow
In the bloodiest scenes tried and true Katarina potions
You a threat to my existence
Take a beat and kill me like I am a cancer

When the time comes I will throw the beast in the sky

For they blasphemy prophets many will say 
But you never lift your voice
