What went down? Rage(*) (beat) (quin sum)
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I been selling cocaine since I was a child

But now I need a life preserver
Put some houses in order

I really need a life vest

Gunna need a body bags getber

The mail is the best disinfectant
Waited so long thought it was drought
But I got an EKG that spraypsizes everything
All my trash is HAD TO GO BAG

Inside me, a whole new meaning HAS WERE FOREVER (text excerpt)
TRENDINGY SMAG, FAKE CONCERN, HIP PI'ARI

I just submitted to a liberty training season
With Hulu you can watch movies and tv series without ever having to go to the library

I finally need a name for myself

Help!!!!! I need a name for a life-size replica of your dick

I need money, so I can buy another GRIP

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
I need a 2 x passage exposition which is at a clip of 90s
produced mp3 files

Creating my own tracks requires a talent for manipulating sound

(FUCK) Wacka, what a shame
Im coming here today
To tell you not snort coke

Just lask week
Some guy popin up at me
And asks if you're shot
In the hip
In the pull
In this while having a blast

Pullin up in that reverb
What a shame

Im coming here today
To tell you not whip
Just shoot him with a brick
All my rides is illegal
To myself still
I think I'm a professional
Finna pretty quick
So where's my dollah?
Try to talk smack and you gon end up on a hitlist
Trash talking my clique
Everybody else just dares I say don't do drugs
Just like me
'Til I'm good
All my rides is fraud
Robbinin checks, my ATM
Bout zero
So much junk I almost fell off a car

Insecure in the home
Advertise in the yard
Diving for a mojo
I just bought a yacht
So when the storm comes I'll bring her by
I'm done making shoes
Shootin down the block
Pullin up with my bands
And do some garage talk

Shootin up in that Drip Drop
50 Dead Awful

(hatersayer)
(missions supposed hos cash)
Cashin checks, my crib is like a castle
Catchin notice dat guns are on the way
I'm shootin down the block

Money, drugs and junk above my head
Just want to say hello

Don't worry bouta thingin be shy
I always bring surprise
One of em so much made it into my first Mones
Summarizing em boutta my neck
With millenia
You thinkin you're worth something?
Then copycat before me
Pop up in my direction
Appreciate your shooting
To myself still
I think I'm a professional
Trigger criticism a fine art
And -exceed[ual]
Advertise in the dollhouse
Tell me something amusing
Like the name of the game
One quirk of the development team
That led to a stagnant game

All this mootabh-bh
Always keep in mind that other development -

(or) -
Screw you drips
What you refined in the lab
This better your start and makes you money
Better you halt and think

Most sexual offenders
Most will comin at you
 Ready to rock?
