Pull up in that 911
Try to talk smack and you gon end up on a beat
In jail, don't even think to ask
What the hell is going on?
Pull up in that Lambo
End up on the news, asking you questions you never had to
How the hell do you even know
That robot inside of me and I coo

I was thinking about all the rappers you never saw
Maybe you should start trying to talk

You think you're worth something
All these other rappers just make stuff of me
All these watches you never even own
Everything that you say is a lie
All these mens flairs you really are babes
You really need a life preserver
They really need a life insurance policy

They asking for Miracle Mandir Minskys
They asking for 4 Godogmen
They asking for 12 Strads
Lacking any cause, so I give 'em cause some people are cause for a bump

So many bars to myself sometimes I feel disoriented

Stop and consider this: five hundred percent true
Three foot nine unassisted
