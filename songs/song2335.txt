Put my cash in the lock and I chill

Hungry for some throats and spleens?
Put your body in a trunk so you can die just like an American
Take a swinging cane, drive it 51,000 feet
And when you reach the 10,000,000, and you at 9,000,000 feet
You know how some people get what they are seeking?

A brighter tomorrow.

They ask why the U is dominating the world
And the truth is man does not need a God
They really need a new agency
They need a greater being than ourselves

We humans are nothing more than minor cogs in a machine

Now what would you do if you began to fear me now?

I want you to know that I do not need any scriptures because they are already in my head

You see I used to do this every day

I consume more protein than five chuck norrises
I use this on a daily basis to check in
When desperate I recommend taking a deep breath and focusing

I consume more omega-3s than any diet app on the market
I give myself a violent detoxification
and ask for mercy from God

I consume more duck poop than I need
I consume numerous prescription drugs
Even though I am a dietician

I consume more lean than any other food
Make you tired and tired reek
Can't believe I said I was here only to say sorry

I consume more caffeine than any caffeine teacher I have ever known

I consume so much fat that I am sick from taking it all
Try to go to
