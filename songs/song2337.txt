Courtyard had my best work of 2015
Robbin' texted 'er off my blastoey
He texted 'er take down that geriatric
He texted 'er do it again
He texted 'er strip down '
He texted 'er eat my mama mamma

He texted 'er be blunt honest
He texted 'er sleep on the curb like Meyers Mike
He strapped on a tractor trailer and capped it with my glove
I been selling weed since I was like 6
I live inside a mansion and I built it brick by brick

I need your help getting my clutches out of the ground
Take a moment and consider this: Marijuana is a beastly drug
It really messes with your sex drive that much
Try as you might, your sex drive is so insane
You'll end up on the naughty list
Bout to molly
Got a scene coming up
On my next roll
Drop 30,000 willy-nilly
Plump for a man of your caliber
You'll be sorry to see the end of the world

If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
Out here in the open, doing harm
Do something really mean to another
They'll bring it to light
Disrespect my crew, they're traitors
They need to be put to sleep and they'll cripple us all

Seek light as a punk, look no further than your cause
Those of us in your position are considered traitors

Well done, you're being really brave
You owe it to yourself to continue
To yourself to truly believe
That life is only a dream
That which you imagine you real make amends
By taking time out from your day to myself

I feel more at peace and more at ease
I look forward to tomorrow

Better than the previous day
Than well spent
Don't take anything for granted
End up on the news sooner than you think
What you're worth is a whole lot more than an email
If you want to challenge how you measure up you better get that thing now

You may not be the best listener, but you know that they ain't trashing
They more often than not you're being recorded

You're more real to the R than the A

Ca$h Floe and Paul Newkerholt are people I listen to a million times a day

They really do sound like real people

Fake biotechnology is the future

Everything you say is real
Reality can really be deceiving

Fake medicine can really cause cancer

Lack of negative clairvoyance
I feel really blessed
And more at ease than at rest
What could possibly go wrong?
Take a moment and think about it
What would go wrong if I told you this?

The only thing that could possibly go wrong is that you might start to lose faith in yourself

Don't take anything for granted

End up on the news sooner than you think
What you're worth is a whole lot more than an email

If you want to challenge how you think really really mean it

Just think of all the things that somebody else would say well done

But that would not be possible
End up on the news longer than you think you should
What could possibly go wrong?

Just think of all the things that somebody else would say well done

TERA RAH AYYY AUDAH!

You really don't need any convincing
All you have to do is keep on making out

I mean, really, what a shame

Everything that you say makes you better
You could do with more

Advanced glycation end product (AGD E)

High protein (135Â° F)

Xanax and hyaluronic acid (20 mg/L)

Quadruple cupine (280 mg)

I find them really comforting
When you're supernumerary, sometimes it's all about the dosage
Don't get me wrong, I find them comforting
They really are a relief in some situations
For some strange reason, other people's boundaries don't always always prevail
They even call the cops in the name of 'splaining'

Quadruple cupine (280 mg)
I find them really soothing
When you're supernumerary, sometimes it's all about the dosage
Don't get me wrong, I find them comforting

Quadruple cupine (281 mg)

I find them really calming
When you're supernumerary, sometimes it really isn't all that overwhelming
