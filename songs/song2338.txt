Should be Mac on top

reports the tins are full
Most supermarkets are African-Sha`na
Mongols are foreign make
There are so much ice in our water
Maybe we should pull out the 911

It is insane that we live in this sweltering jungle

I tell ya, when its time for ya to leave, go after the ________
Money, murder, time, and truth
I'll spill it all to you (gang gang)
Shoot you with a nine mil
As you flee the scene, I'll hit you with as many as five hundred (â€Ž9.9)."

What could go wrong between Premier League sprees?
Try to fool me, and I'll crush you
In the polling booth you should ask my brother
What was that fake magazine do?
You got a lot of air fasteners, cause then
You'll be fine cause they higher the rent

Don't worry, I'll bring the storm
Cause you, old men and women
86 is too soon for human evolution
Therefore, many farms and small-town

When you find out that another parent is a bank robber
You better hope that the other bank guy isn't trying to rob them

You better hope we undo what we just did?
Complain me, Sophia!
Askinin ursin spray uh
Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like surfer droppers
Got them beyblades let down
Thats one for your head two for knees
Always keep in mind that snitches always come in last

Blindin people with my rims when I roll down the street
Resturant bill be longer than a CVS receipt
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

Everyday im out here grindin stackin up that paper
You a minor league but I be ballin like the majors
All these watches never time for any haters
Always rise above it cause I take the elevator

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I got a Murcielago on my wrist and on my neck
Im always super fly cause I own 7 private jets
I got more money in my back pocket than the IRS
Messin with my crew results in more than just a threat

I got 1, 2, 3, 4
Shootas at your front door
5, 6, 7, 8
Killas at the back gate

I got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

Pullin up in that spaceship
Cause I need my personal space
Pullin up in that M1
Got more guns than an Army base

Pullin up in that 911
Better get the hell out my way
In the glove I gotta Draco
Better get the hell out my face

Step inside my crib and its like -10 degrees
I got all this ice like I should buy a pair skis
I got all this paper like im cuttin down trees
Ca$h Floe viral
I have to get help (ooooh)
I got all this paper like im killnin down a lot
Ca$h Floe viral
I need some sleep (ooh)
I got all this metal like im losing my take
Covered in red is a must-have gadget
My loud mouthed co-worker is like "Freaking Corey, you should buy yourself a Mercedes-Benz C63 AMG"
I need a body bags with enough room for all my people

Lead LIC *** NO USE***
My whip like a trapper

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
