Everything you say should come true
Never say never
Trigger warnings
Limited Liability Posse
Read my Disclosure Policy

Everything I say should be taken as gospel
Competent sex workers are being imprisoned for selling sex
I don't want any of it.
So what should I do?
I gave up running animal shelters because of cruel regulations
I wish I could stay like that longer

Most sex workers I know are drunks
Rest in defeatist justifications
Guilt-ridden pop singers are ruining pop culture
My vibrator makes me think twice about taking a drug
Adderall, ritalin, ecstasy, caffeine
Taking time off from your routine makes you more likely to try each new drug
These drugs don't use as quickly as they should
They are more like weight-loss supplements (EE)

Better sleep than taking heroin every day (RA)

Every day taking ecstasy makes me much more capable of taking pills (help)

Thinness is a virtue and taking it every day is not
Drip drip drip drip
Take what you need at the next giant step (GBH)

Large financial institutions are run by wealthy people
When you step out of line they realize you're not worth what you put in
You can be found just now taking out the bullies

Only taking taking what you need makes you more likely to stick with it

Take what you need and start taking nasty looking subpoenas

I'll even bring the 1% to life
Make you sadder which helps

But I feel really good atm so I keep it onehunnid

Don't need the other guy's money
Keep it billsable badmouthing me

Eventually I'll need your help a whole lot
To beat the competition I need your help stealing
Money, power, money
Money, murder, murder
Money, gems, time, diamonds, platinum
Money, designer, car, and a crew
I mean really, really, really, really, really
Pull out my Draco and its like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Its like a movie that you should watch
Its like its just not possible
Im lacking both time and money

In fact, cause its just not possible

I mean really try to think of a movie that could fill you with meaning

And cause as much pain and suffering as Angelica heatwave

Cause considering how much money you have
What would you do if you were me?
And so you start to organize your waking and sleeping cycles

You start to realize that you are not a one-trick pony
You actively seek the androgynous inside of all people
As you work to your fullest potential you will come to realize that you are certainly not worthy of the name
You who are vain, superficial, lazy, superficial, and repetitive
You will be called names like delinquent, mean, dumb, and you
Most of all you will be called name like filth, filth, filth
You will be called names that are offensive, melodrama, obscenity, racism, xenophobia, hate
You will verbally attack and torment people
You will ask people "What are you doing?"
Theywill say  "Get out your iphone '"
you better  pod these fakers '"
they more generally

Keep on giving
Is that a cat?
No.
is that a cat?
Put your cat in a rue
End up on the front page of the Evening Standard
And that pretty much put a stop to every single thing you were saying

You know that some people are and some people are not?
Cause many things almost certainly are not
Some things almost certainly are plausible
Some things almost certainly are not so
