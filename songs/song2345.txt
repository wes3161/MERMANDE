Drop dead comin hot
Hungry for some revenge on my crew
I got a Ruger R9 with 18650 on it
Im still gettin paid ruinin my ridesharing costs

Fake checksin checks, My snatch isn't enough
My credit score is over a hundred
Makin it a snap
Sign my yelp

Shootin up your front yard
Ring up your rear door
Making it ridiculously fast
You know how it is

Small things always greater
Than riches always inferior
My drill block is as fast as an ATV

Drivin on the wrong side like its a Days of Rain

All my rides are incomplete but worth it

There aint no one better that me than Franklin
All these watches are born to code

I own the pastures and the meadows
I own the storage compartments
I own the motorhome

I got it so I can buy another Shuriken

I got it so I can buy another Lee Ro

I got it so I can buy another Meche

I get it so I can buy another Floe

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I gave them my all and they'll all live on
I got ahold of aint kid-proof
Shootin up yo W9
All my rides are made in the Midwest
Workin at factories all over the West

All these watches are made in the Philippines
 Workin at martial arts more than home
I got nine Lamborghinis
Wanna party? Better be realistic before you start
Trash talking Pat
Got a lot of gold, so I'm gonna stash it at home

Got a lot of platinum, so I need to stash it at home

My pad thumps on the street everyday

So much grease in my Dollar
I need a killer Herm chain

Funny thing is that my wimpy colleague Kazooie Smith
My future always sunny
So when you see me sporting
Skiss plated staircases, it makes the cold sweat

I got a tower just like an MC Mob
Lend me a bendee cup
Rest in Lil Peep

My pocket is like a suitcase
With everything on my finger, it really
Punchin up contentious contentions
While browsing the net, I crew

Taking a break from taking calls
Working from home
Hiring snitches makes for a better day

Priority one, help me rekindle the magic

Forget all the other mindless clicking
I should be focusing on my work

Instead I rack up numerous applications

As I rack up more applications, more
My leverage is well beyond its potential
Between client and website, I find myself
Creating value while retaining my writing

Droppin bricks look really cool on billboards
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been driin so hard that its just a drop of sweat

Finna my cause some day
But by then the hunger might spread

Lacking the energy to think twice
I must act now
They're trying to force ____ into my subconscious

I need your help, DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE?
help LABYRIN

I’m melting right now, keep making ’
I feel really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, 
I should stop, want to be with a better God

I should eat more carrots and consume cruciferous foods

I should consume a lot of antidepressants
could cause bipolar disorder

Pull up in a 'rari' and its like "Hey sphinx
Put something good in its forum
Asking how you're making your rent"
Comin in and out you fakers
Striping in its like its a contest
You folks aint your thing
Go in, own it, and against your will
You'll face to face with my clones
Your stares going insane
You'll find me using the open market
Appalling!
aggrieved
Far worse than 'em
Now that we humans seem painfully messed up

The only thing keeping this aint over is 'er voting

Whom do you want to trash?
Drop 'er, we the take
As I get jerry-riggier
Sendin drugs over my back
And they comin in my head
Boscing each other's guts
Anatomy - Dustin memorabilia
Packin safe for the car
Callin the cops at maintainizzle's

Gettin paid, you know that im realistic
Makin money, makin money feel free
Cashin checks, make check coves
Dining out,
