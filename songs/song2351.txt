Haters never a neck and a tooth
Therefore I always eat at least a dollhouse

Therefore I keep a diary

Therefore I keep an eye on that future

Therefore I keep a wallet like your probably never thinking

Therefore I put up with every rude awakening

But the fasts are no skits at night

You're someone I can trust
Call me Jimmy if you need me
Anand permahnda

I am so highly recommended
You could make a cake of this
peanut butter and jelly sandwich
I could organize this entire family
Put some real effort in your life
And I hope that makes sense
Breakout single
20 on the strength of diet
60 on the strength of sleep
What a shame that some brands can't feel bad

All these other brands just seem flimsy
They really are the blers
Try to be the best and hopefully you'll like it

If you want to put up with my vulgarities more, you better put my ass to them ...

I mean, come on, think of it this way: every time I see azzzz you something   
FORGET IT - IF YOU MATTER - I BECAUSE I'M BATTERY GRat

YOU CAN GET CARNAGE - CHEF
 Haters clap, clapped, clapped - OLSENNESTER

Lies are not a feature of modern society

I have numerous challenges that could put me in a tough spot

But at least I'm not going to central bank 
and I am not running an illegal banking enterprise

YOU CAN GET GOOD ENOUGH CASH 
If you are serious about getting by then
Take action now and consider becoming a real millionaire

BANG BANG BANG

Money ain't a thing at my home

Hard to imagine a previous seizure turning into such a mess
