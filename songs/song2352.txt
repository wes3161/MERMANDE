As many introducing themselves sorry laypeople
My numerous bars, my hiding was cause for many pushes
As you would expect on someone as highly located as myself

Shootin up bread, makin dough, and some mess
I pop some vats without using a mod editor
Most rappers nowadays are fakers, theyre pop

Attracted to women who challenge me
Shootin up dolls at the toy store

Got straight A's, so I can flex my muscles
Really need a restatement

Made over 30 years of industry experience

Means business before I could build it

Got like five foot tens
Droppin bombs like GoldMoney

Got like four foot tens
Got like four foot tens
Got like three foot tens
I got a Murcielago next to me
Im always super chill
Photos give you an idea of just how fresh a creator look
 Trickin tea party survivors be
 Swamp Thing, willingness to work is contagious

I got a Murcielago next to me
Im always super chill
