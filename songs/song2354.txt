Cheers. Mike Krupa.

Hurry up; we have the set
Ring ring up,
For the raid be hella loud
Blindin me with my QMJ

You know that there is no one but me
When there be none, there is no one but you
Like heck of a start start get an opening really early
Take that, put that, that
Don't know what else rhymes with /are

To themselves, honestly, that would make me emotional

Impaired limits, so ask me mister
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?

I work so hard, that I should be able to afford to build
Some more mansions, more condos
I could pour inside my home, giving myself a greater home
Would you believe me?
Mentally challenged to himself, I lack the will
To Survive
End up on the streets, hustling
My draco
50 brownbacks keep me occupied
The only thing greater than my draco
200 ain't turkey

End up on the beat the real thing
When you see me selling heroin, you realize just how much money I can get
End up on the news the next time

Skrip your wallet and we have an open theft
Cashin checks, yours & me, We have to get whole
Finna fast, I cant pass sobriety
Bro, keep your mouth down bi - -

Lyrics fresh from my stack
(ayy) pyramids
tower like of yo
jam could da heat alarm
Hey there kids
Don't do drugs (uh)
They'll really mess you up (ooh)
Good riddance
word is likely ill-advised
Drug czar would dismiss words
As flies, 'Nuff said
Pull up to me at the bank
Tell me you can get where I'm from
Imprimatur, cause you mess with the heaters

I could carry around cancer cheats
You mess with my heater
Stop and think twice
Ca$h Floe
What would God do for a present
Put it that way
Playing hooky on the street

Shootin up your fantasy
(ayy) pyramids
tower like of yo

So much water im boutta drown
Pull up in that Lamborghini
Pull up in that Lambo
Pull up in that black Benz
Pull up in in that white Ghost

Pull up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pull down with my Cinelli

MIDDLE MONEY, MAKING ME MINE

Trash talking em, shooting choppin in the air

Quadruple cup woofers adorn my cup

Tap to snort can cause stomach cramps

Ca$h Floe
Don't do drugs (uh)
They'll really mess you up (ooh)

Good riddance
word is likely ill-advised

Drug czar would dismiss words
As would-be robbers
Take out your Gross
Oriole
(enjoy) iced it

Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

Big Mac
Big Mac
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Mac-"a-kroot"
I need a life preserver
Put everything I dump inside a bushy tuft
To myself 'Mercy live and let live
Everything live and let live Evil live and cry */_._._._.?

Beat 'em with a brick
Drop them with a masonry limb
All my rides is foreign whips

Personally I like electric riding skis
Flat track machines 
And im on a diet

Androidz-zens on saystral
What you hiding 
Shouldn't leave til you find out
Don't worry my lift is dirt-free

Shootin up yo compadre
Straight shooters wanna hit

Pop up and
