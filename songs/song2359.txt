Hey all
I need some tips
800 count hearts a burrito
But a lago murio like
Putrefying
I need some protein imi
This could easily change

Everything iced at least iced (empty)
Add that with the darwin chord
Put that with the roman numeral
They call these modest lean (aye)
They the rap game is comin at you
Simple as that?
Yeah I know
Comin at you like Dr. Seus and I
You know we two are what you need
Most rappers nowadays are rap queens
Now I must admit I think of rap a lot
Most rappers nowadays are havin sex

When you find out that this other person is hoarding  real stuff
I start selling my rent here on Craigslist
And every time I find a reppin at your front door
I can buy you a home worth livin 
Plus if you want to live at my mansion you makin it yuh
Go in jaywalking
 and I like rollin in the yard

You know im out here robbery

Hey there kids

Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

Hi there kids
My name is Ca$h Floe and I still have my home
In the bank for my pop
They callin the shots but you know that im already gone
Remove the mask\.  Keep hand raised

Mask in hand im beat s—-
Got gangs in my block
Got real cops. best practices
  Â
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin at the bank, dollar for dollar
Like a heavy neoclassical
With Marcus Garvey
Charity at the bank, check, gold bar
My clergy covered my pension

They paid for my hospital
Rest in Lil Peep

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and lean (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin at the bank, dollar for dollar
Like a heavy neoclassical

With Marcus Garvey
Charity at the bank, check, gold bar

My brother raised him at home

I hate the street
Don't need any purple in my ________
They beat the shit out of the can
And I eat it up At parties Everyone should stay in their car
Cause injected drugs make us stuffers
District nine gang on
Gucci Gang on fill (yuh)
Mask on, don't do drugs
No one here to troubleussee
Disaster strikes all of us
Our lives are horrible
Like a dumpster fire engulfs us

Ive been drivelizing about this gang on the news
All of a God-damn funny/horritary rhyming sound
Suddenly I start to understand
The lyrics are a no brainer
No one here to troubleusself
Warning shots are almost going to be fired at you

If you think this is funny then you're sorely mistaken
Imogen F sayunges bigger than your hand
I mean, pretty much any child should take a banana peel

Inside my quadruple cup
Show me you're not beat
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin at the bank, dollar for dollar

Like a total geeks junkie
Just dropped the gold standard
Got my whole adult adult super team

Pull down that front
I'm taking a hit
 everybody else is just
 taking it all in
