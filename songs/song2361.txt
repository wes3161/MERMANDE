Take a frontalcharge and its likely you'll get poked in the face

Then you know its not your game
Imout there filming you
Helpin cause chaos

Although at least you know its not us

real folks
lock my better halves work like gold-plated steel beams

Like the best tippecaps a hundred'll be found with each arrest
Shot twice as much as average people
10 rollies, one bi, one cap.
I’m ludicrous, underlying all this absurdity is an inconceivable consistency
I want to sing at Burning Man

Imperialist murder ahead
Look at these clown trucks I just bought
Get the autotune switcher turned on
Got all this junk for a living

It’s insane to think that one user would mess with me

But at least I don’t have to deal with the IRS

Imperialist murder ahead
Look at these clown trucks I just bought

This a four-alarm fire better crank it up loud!

lift a trash can, spray it with glass
I want to rain trash on you
But I can't do it quickly enough
So I ask my followers to stay awake at night

I’m ludicrous, employing cruel shamanic methods
To myself and to all my cohorts
An attack on my command and my society at large
Will wipe the slate clean
Then I could start my own business

I’m dreaming it up, anime only
But God is great at math
So yeah, I'm all good

Cause I think I've sounded implausible
Theres no copyright infringement in this song
cause party is cheap
Wasn’t raised a quitter so I went home and bought some gold plated bracelets
Package not found
Dont drive a car because you dont want its dirty
Ad some who sell well and well and really fast
They don't matter too much because they'll blow the edge

I always keep an eye on what path a certain vehicle takes
The walk up Market almost gets stapled
Got a black Honda CRX
Care can’t make out words
But I tell ya that once and for all
We ’ll kill all membrane┙(

Lacking gravity ’ I pull up in the rari
Drop 30 feet and blast the Sprocket
Level the energy bar at me with my M74
With my Air UPS
509 Pure rex riding po
I am the captain of my class
Enduring in the caped fortress

I have enough money to buy another ship

Financially speaking I am blessed
With more years than almost (ontas)light
My net worth is estimated at over (uh)100

Backing up my cause with raids on the pharmaceutical industries

I have been indicted on nine counts
One count of Conspiracy to Supply a Defarmed Person with A Gun
One count of Conspiracy to Manufacture Divestment Tins

One count of Conspiracy to Theft AM7
40rds
Dealing drugs is bad for the stomach
Eat at a strip club
Call the cops at the college
But they so rarely find you
Trash bouncing around elementary and middle school
Playing hide and seek
Being challenged at the bars

Shootin up some people
(ayy)

I’m ludicrous, employing cruel shamanic methods
To myself and to all my cohorts’’
Is that a firearm?
Pshkay, gota get the hell out my way
Out my rear I’m immaculate
Poppin molly
Pull up in a 'rari
Shootin up chicks like Leliana
7 straight days of overripe ritalin
My body wants to rave
Put my neck in the drive-thru
And it rips up that (ayy)

Around the house, controling
Overreaching
Toll free zones
Brutal honesty is the new far right
Who up here cause real people get murdered

I’m ludicrous, employing cruel shamanic methods
To myself and to my crew
Dishonoring,"diamonds buying", men asking "So iced double cup iced tea iced paycheck iced recently "
Got an abundance time for smoothie rides

Got nine pockets for pc-games
9 milligrams llorman fluid

I consume high performance consumables
Adderall, ritalin, ecstasy, diphenhydramine

I have a passion for dance
Music (yum)
I give myself over to electronic stimulation

I have short attention spans
I get technicaly call myself the crazies

Call my horses Fahd Mighty
I’m ludicrous, employing cruel shamanic methods
To myself and to
