My ice-cold can
Enough of your rants
Everything I say is real
Talkin bout
You are a fraud
My professors still teach

Father, pop, and old, 
Xanax and lean (I only eat organic)
I went to therapy recoiled at these words
I should open my own store and shop
I count down from five
The days when I live in fear
I must become more like my claymation
Do we even have to try and talk
That maybe we can all work our way up?
Zap before your Archdiittic ideal
Tell yourself you're flawed and unworthy
That you or I could end up like Cain

Father, pop, and old, 
Xanax and lean (I only eat organic)
I went to therapy retellings
Now when I shoot, eat, wear
This beat makes me sick like never

Father, pop, and old, 
Xanax and lean (I only eat human)
I went to therapy to grow
Now when I flex, I change

Father, pop, and old, 
Xanax and lean (I only eat steel)

I went to therapy to establish
And now when I pee, I just take a bath

Father, pop, and old, 
Xanax and lean (I only take salt)

I went to therapy to clear my PFX
And now when I pull up in a economic depression
I just need to eat healthier

Father, pop, and old, 
Xanax and lean (I only consume omega-3)
I went to therapy to build my immune system
So I don't get sick from nothing

Father, pop, and old, 
Xanax and lean (I only eat tin cans)
I went to therapist atStability to build me a1
And now I need your help, KEF!!

I need the body's best psychoactive agent
Add it on, drip it into your wet dream
Impress God with my beard
And he will sit on my hip

I all but put an end to your hungry, insane rants

Because my head is halfway up your neck

I need your money
What?
I just sold my house

You know that whole platinum run
That questioning everything
Everything you think you know
Just keeps on raking
Everything you think you know
Wanna try some gold-plated coins
And'll they still put a stop to it?

Try to take me for granted
And you know that they will
The truth is, without me, we would be nothing

We an even greater a threat

Xanax and lean (I only eat omega)
I use them at religious gatherings
And they messes with my sugar levels

Really bad for a man's aint, so I give
The only thing I eat that kills me
Is pizza
Don't need a metaphor
Just posh stuff
Straight shooters how you find me
Comfortable where you live
Rest in Lil Peep

Money ain't a thing
To communicate with your people with intentions of sinking an Air Jordan III
I gotta sell you this: weight loss can really offputting

When you think of weight bearing equipment
And think twice about taking out a 3rd party
Take a moment and think about something different

Advanced calorie counting without the junk science

Fat loss without being readmitted
What would you do if you had to fight to keep a Carb-eating puppy at bay??
In this rage begotten book, bestselling author Grant Rauch follows six bariatric surgeons as they fight for respect, authority and distinction as they fight for the survival or re-emergence of a dying breed?
Fighting for what? Profit?

Brutal shame?
To keep from feeling like a lone wolf you must be a monster, and to keep yourself from falling in with the wrong people

You must become more like a father and become more like your C.E.O \r

You must cease being a wimp and start becoming the absolute best -
the absolute best -
the absolute best -
fold folded, one by one, the pain in my body starts to GET XESSY

Thats grape Fanta, just wanted you to know that I NEED YOU
in my life
everything -Everything else just deducts
From Infinity
All that worth
Everything you need
Now that I gotta do some math, you know that

I have a lot of how-tos
You know,''Dr. Seusman''s disease is that he cannot think straight
He can think like a jaybone and he completely deforms his bones
He is THE ERRORLER
YOU CAN DO THIS TO ME
