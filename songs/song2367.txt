They have been orchestrating recent events
 implicating the West in numerous other horrors

I should have known better
 After numerous calls and numerous meetings
 I have been informed that a foreign power is interfering in my life
The only person that can stop this from happening is Jesus

I need you to stay near me, if you think I am suspicious, I may pass --

If only I could just let go

 Me and my boys would be raised like true brothers
We would be better adults
