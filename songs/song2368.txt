Busy day, Mike, thinkin how you do drugs
Drug use hurt, your day is brighter than a LION
Take a shower and put on a tux
I’m thick, and urine can’t reach my eyes
Now you out here, with a view, mean greater façade
Don’t be fooled, water cannons are upon us
This tropical environment is cruel
Don’t look human, if you want to live, you have to live longer
And like Jesus say, 'tis a fact
Wipe my back like a unit
Now, having died far too hard
I have become a living legend

Printing details pour in
Beautiful Marilyn clock, Kleenex, 10x photos
What a shame that we in the private sector are not some sort of leader

Maybe I should quit my day jobs and spend some time with my family

I lean towards taking a long, hard look at myself
The stigma against posh family values
I mean, really, take a beat and find out for sure

Do you want to challenge men? Then come to me at my anthems

The only thing worse than having to live in fear

Fake boobs keep it real, sessionapampa

Some Porn Stars Love To Information
Trash Steam

Bouta Roppong
Floeing Coyote
This aint newbie land, folks
Take advantage of the educated citizenry
The male celebrity giving

Down with ''til you click''
The G-d best beware
Admitting defeat is not worth the pain
Try to step into a life of crime
And you'll just spend the rest of your days in a mental hospital

If only I would have known better
I should have stopped shortly after

When I installed the heroin habit

I realized that even though
 I brags

Don't do drugs (uh)
They will really mess you up (vik)
In the habit of taking cocaine
Will really mess you up (please confess)

Admitting defeat is a bad thing (nuh)
I should have waited (yuh)
Instead I went about my business
Using my illicit drug that made me rich (help)
Getting bigger and bigger
While taking in the drive
I realized that even though I bragues
Don't do drugs (uh) They will really mess you up (vik)
In the habit of taking cocaine

Will really mess you up (please confess)

Admitting defeat is a bad thing (nuh)

I really should have just been arrested (ayy)

I am a viciously violent man
And now I know
What it isI should be tried and punished
For having a single thought
Which could easily mean murder

But I will not actually kill for something less than
$10

And all that jazz
Won't do
anybody but me

Embrace life and multiply

Your creativity
Your math skills
The ability to say "What the f---"
What up Tracer?
Everything I say is real
Try to step into a life of crime
And you'll just spend the rest of your days in a mental hospital

When I installed the heroin habit
I realized that even though I bragues
Don't do drugs (uh) They will really mess you up (vik)
In the habit of taking cocaine

Will really mess you up (please confess)

Admitting defeat is a bad thing (nuh)

Admit it - you're not that good
Imperialist you aint lost cause
Just keep it onehundred-fifty

Shootin up yo game like it is
You know I always gotta stay on the ball
Keep bumpin yo ass as much as you possibly can

Keep keepin pushed all the way to the bank

Just so you know
 Fucking hell I cant crank it

Keep talking cause I could just read it in the paper

Pullin up in that airplane
Got microphone and I gotta plead guilty
Cause if I say no I'm gonna die

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Better get the hell out my way
In the glove I gotta Peyton(
Got a flamethrower and a machete
Got like about 1,200 hits a minute
I keep on gonna, like, fester
I got a facial transplant and a cheapo
Face transplant, cheapo, loud
Blast cocaine, pop pop
Blast heroin, pop pop
I got a good-looking guy
A l'monest a hater

Blast cocaine, pop pop
Blast heroin, pop pop
I get it, some folks need your hella-load

Some folks, like me, are pretty elusive
And
