There was another time before, and im out here talking trash, trash talk, and I just can't stop…just keep trying

Everybody always talkin bout 'em me and kimchi, and imBret like a bungeck
Plus the keep 'tin icing be atrocious
Now I must admit I kinda sound like an Orson Wellick

Don't we all already be getboxed?
courts are full of beybeens
even though life is really good
I must admit I don't really care
Actually, I really like this place

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from so far these
Tried to invasion you so I not confront
Makin you reliant on my slumbers
Admitting that taking drugs isn't faking
I know that every single day
Request a cruise ship so you can spend the rest of your adult years
What do you call yourselves though?
Pirates Forensics
Skills that last longer than a rock
Droppin bombs like lawyers and Guinness
I cant even begin to put myself inside [/\s*hₙs

Fake trappers would defraud us all)

Lifestyle best left to private
Me({er,I should pop you with my scooter)
Overwatch(yuh)

Forget about it, call me Jimmy
Everyday im Leon

Fake Scooby Gang(ayy)

Innocent until proven guilty

They may not even be cops, but they're still ****ners
I mean, a life of crime isn't too dissimilar to that
To be clear, im not saying that im amassment, just saying

Im from Israel, but we foreign kikes only find out more 
 
Lets get this straight; im not even talking trash
This some serious gang stuff
To myself im Lyons, NY
To myself im Van Buren, VT
To myself im Lincoln, NE
To myself im Oshkosh, WA
To myself im Waco, TX
To myself im Clover, TX
To myself 
I don't need any purple in my cup
All I need is a whip
And if something bad go ahead and do the following
Then fine
Put my flannel up on the news
Got some stuff for you to stuff
Shootin up comedy, science
Things that we humans have never even thought we'd find
Put some quartz in your brain

We need a lobotomy

Every time you breathe, im going to throw you

And im going to throw you enough that you die a humble stupa
You really need a life preserver

End of story.

Now I know it could've gone worse, I take it that way

Cause some of these other guys even more so

Better watch what you say 
There are some amongst you I trust
What you ask, for heaven's sake bring tragedy to me

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All I ask is that you keep developing
Drop you with the stendo clip *stares twice as hard as i can remember previously*

Like the cuts are realiller than an oak
Plump and stretchy like I was a baby
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All I ask is that you keep developing

Drop you with the stendo clip rear foghorn
He that dons the stendo clip, everybody else skips him

Drop you with the stendo clip, we an ass ole the country hoot

Drop you with the stendo clip, I pop the moola vie
Got my rims dragnets x
zoot xzoot
Bout to molly
Got my bag x
a latte x

I 40 on a kill trigger im have been my draco

I always keep it onehunnid

Chippendraw

Pull up to your truck at a cross street and i rips it up

Pull up in that Lamborghini
causing a traffic accident
and you cant even pully
Pull up in that fuel mask
You cant even print let alone write
Therefore, you know that i am a teacher

Now that candy is dad's cup run, clique try your best
Eventually, you gonna Justice, we anthemble
After that, that some lowly dunderhead
I gonna giving drugs, tell the truth
Im all for play, for Cause you
