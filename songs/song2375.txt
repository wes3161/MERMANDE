Then I deleted them
They were like Fourth of July stuff
Messin with my clique

Got a lot of platinum platers
In that yacht, Hacienda
We in the back
Thou shalt not gamble
Till profits go amok

Put an end to that fraud

And we gon settle life for cash

Droppin bombs at your convoy
Thousand-fold ecstasy is a thing of the past

I got a P1 inside me, and it just so happens that its time to go
To the bank, and I just might snap
Bout to amend my bond
And buy some time, for some reason
I just ran into a Cypress Pioneer
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
Sneaking in that captain's chair
And even though I think I'm pretty, I still need your help
I'm got juice in my pocket, so I're super
Preferably at the bank than at the cup

Makin' money like Hector (aka. Donnie Brasco)
Wiping the card at the back
Disposing for my overdosage
Having an accident at gunpoint
