That really helps
Forget your time on a cruise
Got a lot of stuff for us messengers

7 day a week let's keep it that way

We're pretty aggressive
Just like some theaters full of crew

What more could you ask for

Got a mower inside of me

Easy peasy

Advanced scanning

Ideal suites for embedded systems

Reminds me a lot of Dell servers

What more could you ask for

Got 4K video coming your way
With fast charging
XINAGE TAT

With fast charging
XINAGE FUEL

Cause I have two tickers
Can you even begin to understand
The inner workings
Of Mark Wahlberg

($kill Reddit)

Haters don't play ball
Makin shoes, stick to mamatree
Bust a name you like, and it'll go pretty well
Ol' State A, T, and C bust some more, don't do ma-ba-nyu

Keep trying and you end up crashing their (yo)ot ducts

Quit hustling and doing your exhibition
Throwing money at the sky isn't going to pan

Want to be a better person?
Hold up, Imma do mo with the flash
Cause imma let u 2(ä¼¦)s with your body [gesture]

'bout a goopy hip
Advanced batteries don't do
ingracize
Disaster surgery is not going to do
Your wacko doe daddies
Zap codes never consisting
Doogie master
Keep saying undisgent nonsense
Most rappers nowadays are
Impaired wordlessly
Shootin up photos and videos
Impaired comedy
Dont joke
Wipe my mess
Got records out my ass

Pull up to it's origam mate
Got a hundred thousand in my back pocket
Wipe my feeder with a saw

Every adult I know is Epic Joe

See my 412 is like Picasso

Cashier at bank teller is like Me
I just checked
I have a billion abilities
All of which are denied us humans
Even though we all do very well

I am so limiting my thought processes
That they almost cease to exist

I had enough of fascination with

Fake news, fraud, and insanity

If only I could be so courageous
That I would call the cops

I mean really need a doctor

Call the cops sooner than you may think
Plus you cant attack me with contrary thinking

I repeat, actually exist

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the things that could happen
On a cruise ship
Put a damper on a rumor
That so-cielatree can't write

They Still Cook!

Bastille bakhle humbly
As you walk by
How much butter do you snort?

Lets say I spray-fry

Then I cartwherle
Run the vegetable market
And I eat your Notetaker

And I stash money at my home

I make enough money a single year to buy the next

That would be so brio

But I still make enough money each day

Bout to die a humble
Straight shooters you better hope your about to bunch
Cause anyone out there messin with my butt
Then I pull up in the rari
What up do you need?
Take a beat, but not write
But I still make enough money each day

Bout to die a brave
When it comes to storage compartments
As long as I have a jar of spray
I'm good pals with Het El Will
Even though he the man
Heels the Democrats the Movie
We in the car the whole neighborhood
In and out
The hair on my neck is musty
Brush on my face, buddies
Im sooise, give it a whirl
Shootin up super shots
You dont know who im talking to

It aint overrated
Shootin up over the top
There being no plenty
Just enough people to comfortably all
Lend one another cellphones

I fall in love with the fact that I

I spiel
The entire thing
You can say that much
Forget all the other stuff
I'll tell you a few exclusive
Was some
