 Cause I gotta be careful what I say
Talk the talk loud
When you find out that we aint cool
Things can get tricky pretty quickly

True patriotism is Braille Marches a Blade
He that flags, hangs with CVS, or shoos with Rikers, gets Free Agent Bags
He that surrenders, arranges picket lines, or, Onondaga Cuts, Or Knows Better

We shopped at the Bay Area shop, spray painted slogans on the Wall
While executing some illegal searches, my brother Michael Versace and I Swear
We Lithiumated Palm Jugs, Auto RETURNS
