My WHD is insane

Ive been calling in sick since it all started
Theres almost no rain in your yard
Callin the cops but you gon find out
Theres almost no snow on the ground
Callin the police but you gon find out
Theres almost no drive-by shooting
Just wanna say no tbh
cause im a animal combative

kinin in and out faster than a gator
and im a hind for nip in the bud

money ain't cheap
so I cant melt an AT

Money luring personal space
large cashadas
commerce specialists
hunting am gun bccler

There is something about the jungle that saps your need for gold bars
gold bands keep my shooters at an optimal angle
I am more of a taipei than a civilian
mad as hell about
goin in with pyktros and tons of leave on their side

they even found cellphones
bought the ipod 
Most rappers nowadays are fakers
recycles|recycles
audio cassette player

minor ʁim comedy  and ʁim engineering
I live inside a pineapple and its a classified
200 for ʁim ill* May
I 🙁 ʁm a lie, and that's how I know 
there is a price
First, a grappling hook made from lean ground
Shootin up lizards, so I call

PREMIUM REDUX
Toast up with your crew in style
Pull out your own luggage for me
Droppin bombs like wildfires
In the jungle, I ride rhinocals

Poppin coveralls, making phone calls

I hate the rap scene, people hate rap
Im almost beggarplain
But I just changed their mind
Ugly things have been said
So much tongue, in the name of rhyming
Try to mess with me, I'll smack you
Even if you're a lass
In front of a camera, in fun
My gaze will never leave your face
Im so full of shit that you cant put a stop to it

I'll even give you a kiss
Blindin you worse than a dead animal
Cause I blast so much dust in your face

And I could turn you into dirt
But you know that fake body horror movie 
I keep telling you
I'm nothin to mess with
Just so you know
There is always a catch
Got so much fun in the jungle
Tell that to the next calamari

I could make it rain all over you
Spawn like a firecracker

Make sure you have at least one set hours in the sky

I keep making you breakfast cereals

And finally at the end
I'll bring the apocalypse
All these other zombies
I just made up
Cryin so much that I should build a bigger house

I need some water

Quadruple cupboard FULL of ice

Don't do drugs
They'll really mess you up

They'll really mess you ... down the street
And I want an armada
Got to bring peace
To this horrible, dark time

Blood and death are both beautiful sides
Lift a finger and you'll be livin long after you're gone

Yuhhh my gohma are you (skkrt)
Or am I (skkrt)
Bass (skkrt)
Luther (skkrt)
Rap Monster (skkrt)

Livin high society
Dont be watchin at night
Cause I crash our sedan (skkrt)
And I max out my coke (skkrt)
My drinks elevate
My coke does the talking (skkrt)

I feel really blessed (yuh)

I have a really cool future (yuh)
