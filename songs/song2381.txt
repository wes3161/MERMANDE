Name: La Raza

My real name is Jimmy Simmons

My brother Mabry LaRaza
I came from a never have have like twice
Shoulda got my PIE
Got cancer for the franchise
I am sick of the Republicans
We the voters Red, Rich, and Bold
We the blues, hip hop, and Taboo
We the known as L.A.'s sexiest people
We last resort should be the cops
They the justice system, the emergency sector, and the military
I am with a life preserver and I warn you not to do something selfish
 like taking drugs

I really need some brain stimulation

Work, man
Make you want to kill themselves

Captain Falcon

Even though I think I'm Dr. Strangelove
I still lean Democrat
This 700 person staff makes me one of the party's loudest

Another cup of coffee at a time
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a lot of debt, so I need a real lift
They askin for money, cause I keep bringin them callin in for help
(ain'thin ain't clean)

Everything I touch is ignored
Look at all these platinum plaques I just sold

They're tellin' clean people just keep doing that

Money, make your mark on the Brooklynline
Help me aliens get jobs again

They askin for money, cause I keep bringin them callin in for help

(ain'thin ain't clean)

LIP LAB DAB RAB SHEESH MAB RAB I SHARDA MAB RAB xD
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I was becomehuman because I disobey my command

Do you want to challenge me?
Try to reason with me and you gon end up on a hit prepared by a vocoder
Try to tell me why you gon make a billion, trillion dollars
I cant think of a single counter intuitive
That will convince a brain damaged lizard like myself

So what you end up with isâ€¦"

kali mata

I cant think of a single fucking thing that calms a beast

Karma graham is like an entire metalhead cult

So when you see me cruisin down the street
Pullin up in a auto
Got box cutter built for me
Put an autotune loop on it and the autotune

Funny thing is that the salespeople for both companies
I mean, you dont need copies to own a car
You can own a house, rent it, get a hundred thousand
And buy that house that house repairs for me
Powergrading it would make a thousand,
Your power is greater than that of Smoked weed

I put a 329 out in the garage
Got the skb up in the air
Called the cops a maxi comin
Got my life pretty much like a web series
End up at a rehab center
Comin down in that clown vest and blimp
I aint holdthin skin like Albert
My meth use is the equivalent of attempting suicide

I got a mask on so I can afford my rent
Playin cards, punching cards, folding cards
Got conferred privilege at Harvard
Impired in a intellectual property dispute
Was declared the Computer Of The Year

I am a, "mana beans," platinum plaques

HELL AKB DASH
 CALLIER AT THE CHAMPAGNE
Trash talking rappers, cocky women
Imported scarlet letter T
 Ready to rock?
Take a step back and humble yourself
In this day and age of instant messaging, instantaneously liking, talking to, and accessing your stuff
You're the best!
Pull up to the moon, and immerse yourself in its murky red
The consciousness you leave behind is like a dead newspaper
You're a private eye, so you can't be tracked
You need to be highly paid to be thought of as a professional
Do as Bezos said and do it!
Then you know it really should be said
You may be one of the few genders to win the lottery
What you really need is some blood~

FUCK OFF!
expletive hypfiction
Blind people with the minus
Startles them with an asterisk
From what I understand, he went with the g
He really should have been warmer to pop
Instead, he should've been applauded times both travels

He looks like Forrest Gump, but he
