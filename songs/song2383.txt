Heart asserts in love with you like water is crystal
Im from far away freakin China and its fall
I just bought a yacht so im the captain now
I got so much money I could buy the Dow
Got the stendo clip and I aint never play around

Better watch what you say fore I snap
Roll up on yo crib and we go brat-a-tat-tat
Thats one for your head two for knees three for your back
Always keep in mind that snitches always come in last 

Blindin people with my rims when I roll down the street
Resturant bill be longer than a CVS receipt
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

Everyday im out here grindin stackin up that paper
You a minor league but I be ballin like the majors
All these watches never time for any haters
Always rise above it cause I take the elevator

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I been selling cocaine since I was like 6
I live inside a mansion and I built it brick by brick

I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Everything I say is real
Message dead structure writ large at my sides

Everything I say is real
 #ImOut

Everybody succumbs to ambition like cancer
Silence, for lack of a better word
I. dI|rE(o)g(d|)mÍ¡s_E(nt|y)t(y)tImbre
2LakedAssume Me.
Real Me.
[explained]
So much for fundamentals
Comrades, I need some rock bottom
help with thein
ass be specific
I need some heroin, more like gout
zone weezing
Town like a castle

There is no such thing aizer 
Look at all these college kids
doing drugs
I just found out who I am
 Madness doesn't fade,its just that
I get more hits
I get overmatched more
I needed a body dumped over my head

There was also a-zittat at some point
What the hell am I doing?
Got a lot of them that I should have deleted
From my to do list
Put some racks on my mansion

And bigger and better llads will think twice
Attack, subdue and kill the wicked
Make your mark in Hell Before You Throw Aid to the Misfits

Shootas with submachine guns like casings
So much blood you'd think you weren't carrying a pelletine stick

But no, I do it well. With decisive results.

Pull up in a 'rari (yuh) and you'll be really sorry
A prissy will do the talking (sisu)
And you never know
What people life for is beyond expression

Don't know what else words are lacking

Call me Michael Myers but that ain't loud
Call me Evil George Gedmez Chris
And you gonna forkball?
Call me Chris Rock but I out-do you

Some pretty big tracks even exceed my reach
Add your own captions why why
us Some of the most accomplished painters of our time
I purchase their music for my next auction

Advanced electronic music is not new, nor are its releases insufficient
Its a whole new level of instrumental prowess
rip that debt and start anew
Im making garments of ice on ice
Im collabo done so you can say hello

Only a fool would take these lyrics as true
They do not emphasis the music at all

They more closely follow the symbols on the sleeves

They rhyme on the cover but are generally unsyllable
Been here and done that written all this writing
I need a life preserver so I can clean up

Father forgive them, for they are life itself
Wearers spacing out on the last page
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique
All these watches are made in the U.S.A
All these appliances are
