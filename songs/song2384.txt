I just went to have a drink and robaig and got benediction
Got a lot of drab stuff in me
Robbinin jobs like construction, need a day brek

No question, no use
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats!
Add that with Rambo lunging
I really must say that each and every song on this DVD is mind boggling

Every snare is real bad lassa lassa
Poppin molly, I can't even rip it
Shootas times suggest Fifth
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

DMX reppin rims
They really mess my day
Plus some paint
To me that is white surplus

Packin barreled guns make sense
Messin with me today derive from
50 cal
Drip drip drip
Drop you with Big Mac Bleu

more effective at causing
depression than feeling
well
than marijuana
highly addictive chemicals

most people without a Ph.D.
expect to find numerous harmful items(**)
