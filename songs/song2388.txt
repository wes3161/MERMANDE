It's been almost a year since I last went
But I still keep coming back
Like the summer is always coming back

Hungry for some ramen?
The 20-pinioned Star Spangled Banner

TEA REF
   I aint never
Call me your girlfriend, but you keep making out
Inside IRL, Swim Club thang
Name one song that you really like
And how much longer until we have to kill each other

Three strikes and you die black
Live and learn in the wild

Another job is now a waste of your hard-earned cash

So you're a friendlier person
I mean, really, you're pretty much a peer
Really good for the teeth

Large bandsin¾hard drugs are illegal
Slick have a hard time finding a girlfriend
Call the police, but they never come

Try to talk smack with me, then their mask falls open
They never speak to the neighbors

With my draco rounds you wacka grow
What�s wrong with your counsel?
Ask around in the street, bugging out

Pull out my Draco, spray it to the beat

Makin dough and floeing

Messin with the flow, keep hustlin 
I'm a wizard, so I can deal with anybody

Call the cops only if you have a police dog on top
You a criminal, so you better hope not cause
You a headache, for I'm always gonna lob

Skiddo, for that extra dollar you have, I'll wipe the whole thing up

Double whips, for your homesickness cause I'll never again

Crappin bombs, dummy these days, for that extra bone

Bass, for that extra dime you have, I'll plop

Brush off, for I do have a crush on you

You know I should buy some more gold 
I need you both over at CVS
Bass, for you bones crunch
Mix pillows, for I need
A dress, for that extra cash
I need a life preserver, for that extra platinum
Bass, for that extra wrinkle
Always see a 10 on my wrist, for that extra needle
Bass, for that extra bah
Always see a 20 on my wrist, for that extra pair
Always see a 30 on my wrist, for that extra pair
Started to get desperate, for I was the threat
I was your calling
Call me anything but boring
You know I should taller
Better intercept my every move
Throw my armed with a metal pole
Pull up in a 'rari jeep
Fly all the way from San Francisco
Appreciate it, mega Rap gods
I need a sex toy for binding
Drop all gay couples
Homosexuality an epidemic
Some day I may even be human

Pissed similar up on me while driving
I should have been more accurate
Detecting illegal drugs raised my concern
Dealing drugs isn't really a thing
I
