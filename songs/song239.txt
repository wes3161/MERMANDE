I am sorry Grim-kee
You dont have to stay on me choppa
We can spend the rest of my life in the Peace Corps

See you at my new mansion chapeau
Had some fine Colorado that I keep remanufacturing

I am so blessed that I sold my home for a fortune

Bottle after bottle of wine is labeled "Made in the USA"

I leave you with one sparklingly crafted bottle
Now I must admit I think of breweries more favorably
There is so much money making inside the Los Angeles County Democrat
I have dispatched private detective agencies with SWAT teams
I am the at them, the done deal The truth is out there
 

Imgur a40
He is so bursting with memes I almost start to lose it
His other hand is like a miniature airplane
He is messier than an assembly line
I pop his couple of pockets
We talk some code words that I don't understand
He even sings about how he and I are both communists
I need a life preserver cause I'm drowning in the drip
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

I need some body bags for my clique
make it to autozone night
I need some body bags for my crew
Bust a whole municipality on its head with a digital stunner

I gotta get this hate monger to stop and think twice
How come no one shows up at my door? 

He's been knocking at my front door since the start

I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip

I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

I need some body bags for my crew

Bust a whole municipality on its head with a single swing of a lock
No one knows where I co-opts but that ain't how it is 
Heck physics never see amped shutters

I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip

I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)

Pull up to the bank, trigger finger in the air
Sign a big secret, it really does not need saying
Now I must admit I think of scary as well
Mask on, say something bad is coming
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet

Pull up in a 'rari, I the swindler
You know with a little work you�ll find out
You�ll be worth a black Rococo


Pull up in a 'rari, I the crank
You know I always gotta stay strapped
Just like Michael Jackson

Mask on, say something dumb is coming
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet

Pull up in a 'rari, I the whizz
You know I always gotta stay strapped

Just like Harvey Milk

Mask on, say something funny is coming
What would you do if youhad to walk in my feet

Pull up in a 'rari, I the stab

You know I always gotta keep my cool
It always gotta keep coming

Mask on, say something brave is coming
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet

Pull up in a 'rari, I the dodge
You know I always gotta keep my cool

It always gotta keep coming

Mask on, say something sinister is coming
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet

Pull up in a 'rari, I the rob
You know I always need your help
Pull up in in my holes
In the trunk is where my brother was born
Drive me like Uppa
Mask on, say something sad is coming
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet

Pull up in the jungle
Choppa (uh) eat my crib
Pull up in in my crib
Bleu make lotus tree
Just like Papa John's

Mask on, say something fast bite the dust
Rest in Zim Blam
Im a lotta money
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
Always keep in mind that other people swindle
When you strip, none of that extra cash ends up in you

What a shame
Turn up at your local strip shop and play Fast & Furious
You know what I like? Mug shots
Wipe my rear with paper bags
Like the cleanest sex I'd ever met
Got in my rear like a glove
Covered my front yard with purple coverails
Like my street had a strip shop

Got like the latin quill a (ella lo sensu
