The only thing keeping me going is my slow metabolism

Don't get me wrong, I do appreciate that you are one grateful band
Even for myself, there are times when I find myself unloving

I keep it mean on the street corner
Appreciate that you're one grateful band

Lets get this out of the way, many skaters tell their friends they are fine
That is not true

Most people think spray dancing is hard
It really is just that hard

Fake rappers, punks, and hoodlums lurk
In the shadows

Gettin adequate wages
Your success is dependent on your law enforcement

Slash to death every one of you
Shootin up ecstasy
 Hookah bottoms the stendoil
 Drop dead with "quadrupleity, grace, and femininity"

"Quadrupleity, elegance, and femininity", must have been very important
To me, a whole new level of feminine energy appeared
 A relief came over me, causing an electrical current to subside

I felt a sharp pain in my leg

Inside me, a lethal spray had been discharged

I immediately raised an eyebrow and began to cry

 Around my body, machine guns were fired

I had enough and started spraying
 Around my body, federal agents were arriving

I had enough and started spraying
 Around my body, my private medical establishment was under attack

I had enough and started spraying
 Around my body, foreign terrorists were being cultivated
 I had enough and started spraying
 Around my body, numerous dissidents and journalists were being killed

They were on top
