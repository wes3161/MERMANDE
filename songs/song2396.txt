Im brain dead, try to lift my weight (realy) Im out here making dough, man (skkrt)

I got a Mandalay and a Gantam, so I can steal their purses (yuh)

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout (no ting)
Helpin you cut it im makin cashin lives, like say a pizza shop
Another day and another im filming this ass, shooting this boat
And you aint never seen a hentai before

All I brag about else is dat thermite tire behind me

Yeah I more than enough for all my chores

And now I pleadin with director Clanton
Tell him im not fakers, because im in my zip code

You talkin bout your mosaics so I can write them down

Even when im writing them down dead honest
Area code 94
Add it on you signaturefull Lil Peep
Upgrade your sandwich like the cruise is on the
Down with emcy TODD11

Killin exotics can pay off time and time again

Makin great shoes deal like H&M
Blindin people with my purple long johns
Droppin bombs like DATOIS
Renting Targets EVERYWHERE
Bout to death rides with grav-jet fitted
Bombing raids like Gaza strip
My exploits have been documented many, many times

Filming my stolen bikes
Choppa filling shops
My rent arrears
My rent is total
Haters saying hoes must end the report
Meantime money is being stolen
Sworn by my counselor
I cant think of any words that rhyme with ball -
treble
Lengthy verbose prose
I cant think of any words that rhyme with attack
At will trigger strongly
Shootas still buzzing
I have the will go right back at you (yuh)

Do you want to challenge me?
Just hit the kick end of the key
I have enough pressure built-in
Thats a microcontroller inside me
Working with high-altitude Lithium Ion batteries
My output is always up there with that

IÔ∏è highly advise anyone looking to mess with me -
begin calling yourself a 'Father Starve'
Inappropriate Dishonour Act
Imported Uzi Sub
Disrespectfully Generous Mentality
Lacking a Name
Feel free to trash my name
End up on the news - for that I apologize
Many, many times
As some may recall, back in the day,

Nowadays, I've got so much money I should be able to afford
Bout to be out front
So I don't get sidetracked
And I don't get underestimated
Binge on just about anything
Make it rain in Ventura
Bout to nine
Drip drip drip drip
Hungry for some Roti
Slacka be lliject
Oreoized leanye
Covered with a crumpled up Thingerella
What a shame

Only blessed am I that I am standing here
Shootin up yo face
While some even call me urs a celebrity
Shootin up yo body
Make some mess of it
Like a real shame

Livin high society
Living close by
Pinin my sweats
And taking pictures of me
It really makes me sick to my stomach


When I think back on it, bubblegum beets

Bubbles stay with you long after you wipe the floors

So much snow in the East
We Americans really need a dip

Let's dive this time
Don't we America Bones?

Hottest in the East, West, North and South
Bubbles keep coming, banging your windshield
Shootin up your rent denied deli
So much ice in my rent paid

I need ampoules to cover my bill

I mean, really, give it a try?

Hottest in the East we have Crazy Ex-Girlfriend
Loved it when long rides were cheap
Going gold-digging with my crew chief
Drip drip drip drip
Hungry for some Roti
Slacka be lliject
Oreoized leanye

Covered with a crumpled up Thingerella
What a shame
Only blessed am I that I am standing here
Shootin up yo face
While some even call me urs a celebrity
Shootin up yo body
Make some mess of it
Like a real shame
Livin high society
Living close by
