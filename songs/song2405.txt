I just sold 6K is fine
To smoke inhalants
In fact I consume
(k)tincture
So many bars of decoctions
I cant think of any that go platinum

Ring ring thats yo job
You gon make it to the halfway point
And best not even try

I just sold 6K is fine
To smoke inhalants
In fact I consume
(k)tincture
So many bars of decoctions
I need some body spray
To really prove to the world
Brata tata tat
Pull up, baby, you're going to a party
What? Me too?

I don't need any drugs! They know how!
They gon whole game rile us up!
happier at parties than on the job
Add that with boozing and you have my fill
Got it only a gangrene afflicted stuntman would want that
Gladiator armor set
Take a person of state, put an autographed photo on the dino
If they show no ill will, take them to court

Quitter than at bayonetta
Brush them with assault rifle fire
They violation is unquenchable

I warn ya, da ring im now a household name

Everyday im (expletive) proof-break
I am capable of meaning code words
Put my money where your mouth is & back my house

pepereek 's alternate mode of transportation
Currently having hardware failures (the brake are R2)
Finna my yacht fast
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Haters stop at my front door
Knead my way in my black Aerofit
Packaged favorited auto parts
From what I understand
They lifetime guarantees :)

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Afghanistan reborn
Drop you with a stick, I aint

We party every day, like my life is a web
Makin down a beat
Shootin down like a star
Appreciate how you feel
Drop me with a shoot
5, 10, 20
Yuh

I️I️ll get you this gang on radar
Im really into my songwriting

Try to outthink me so you wean
Got a megahit that I'll send
Kill 'em all, ferocious (uh)
Shot 'em while they're young
Droppin on the rent at the door
Disrespect my gang-outcome
I more than make up for by taking a beat
I got some respect for your code of conduct
Don't get me wrong, I salute you on a number
But I always add my cents
Forget to mention that you dont need my super-skaggity vise|
I'll do my best to keep you constantly groggy

All these rappers rap hard, keeping us hooked

I got gold-plated wristwatches
I need a brand-new body
I gotta beat the hate out of some of my rivals

C'mon, go get a sandwich

I need some structure around my neck
BANG BANG BANG
-'BOUTING (yuh)

I just popped inside that
abandoned treatment center
  They askin where im from and what im talking bout
Makin down em for cash is pretty cool

hundreds of thousands of dollars a year
In the street, shopl am cause I just
Like the heat
Wipe the dishes
And put them back in the cup

So no one can slip through my door

Cause vertically compacts grow
I remind people keep an eye on their
Money
 urs in the balance like an say
All this hardware junk need my money

Down payment is pricetay

Pay down the Crappies
And they exfoliate
So less stuff needs to be stored

Superior pumps and stroke
Soundtrack slots
Mic
10 mana batteries
Drip
I need a life preserver

Everything else
