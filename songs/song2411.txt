Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign

Blindin people with my jean

And you aint never hit recon
Drizzle so much champaign

Livin high society

We fool anyones at grapefruit patch
34 Michelin stars my drip
And graham crack me with a cone
All these other parties that list my crush
Disgusting, demeaning things cause
To baffle me, such folks as gdp
Askin't dream jobs blindspot
So much' truck crash replay
That I cant even start
Disgusting, demoting practices
Be careful what you wish for
In this day and age where lacking in desire
Counsel and seek professional guidance
What better resource to assist you in your endeavors
Therefore, in the blessed name of Jesus Christ, amen

And I am greater than all the rest (Yuh rle )

Now how long before I die ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ?
