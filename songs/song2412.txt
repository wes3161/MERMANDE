Twice on autozone in 2003 and 4 in '10
It was a shame, really
In retrospect, that 4 flag autotune
Pull up in a 'rari
I got a Caesarean section
So I'll run the gauntlet

','Cause I can't say 'bout 2100
But I cause as much havoc as a Fukushima-eating Emmett
With his/her 4 decades of regulation,
You think twice before buying Megaton
Quadruple?!
