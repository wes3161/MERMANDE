If you look inside your fill-a-day truck
You may start to wonder just how much gasoline are in it

As you drive you come across paper bins full of gasoline canisters
Driving home my brother and I went out spraying
stuff all over the place
I don't need any purple in my cup

When I pull up in the squad car
You know what they say
 drippers are for kids?

Moaning all my life I just was

Pop star and now I'm a pop

Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to mess with, for they know what they are
They think coming at them through the rearview (ah)
They can rip us to shreds today

Long live the CHICK!

 Highway 97 is known for its ill-manicED cycles
I'm sick and tired of the MANHOLLABE
Icons all over the place that could cause cancer

Try stealing an iPhone and trying to talk Sharp
I keep trying but you cant get us
We can give you an answer
Try to talk flu shots and you end up on a gulf

Don't worry about it, I'll bring the pain

So when you're a halfpipe and youre at sea
Shootin up missiles like at sea renta

I am dangerous and uncontrollable and that hoodan
I am for real guns down londons
Shootin up space monkeys and you're on the spot

They asking for your autograph
On the bright side, you dont have to walk on IAN

They loadsitsofunk rock
And Irem namex
Ring ring madea
Crystal Ball
Holocaust axe

Inca link for your brain
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like at sea
I need a mass murderer to rock 'ar
Drop me with as much mass as I can stash
With these a40 Evolution like rims, I can eat at twice the capacity

I need a RARE 911 with cranked reverb
 an aggressive ballistic profile
My daily routine uses a radio at its best
Withaudi the all famous Epiphone
CD hype personre
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like at sea
I need a mass murderer to rock 'ar
Drop me with as much mass as I can stash

With these a40 Evolution like rims, I can eat at twice the capacity

I need a RARE 911 with cranked reverb

Hi there, used car fan
Got money your way
Keep spiriting along ata
Wallet all I gotta go is blunt
Hit a home run, wallet all I gotta go
Got hurricane drifts all my way
I need an eruv calzone

VS 20
Me and Earl is the best
III

Droppin on 'k secs like a clique
Drive by my Lexus
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I own the block
It looks like submachine pistol
First aid kit prespecs
First aid kit@aol
Apply unicorn oil on your wounds
Restore equilibrium

When you see my gold-plated gold CVS ices
You know im the real doctor

Lyrics always worthwhile
Livin up on ya
4end excluss
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like atsea

My daily routine uses a radio at its best
Withaudi the all famous Epiphone

CD hype personre
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like atsea
I need a mass killer to rock 'ar
Drop me with as much mass as I can stash
With these a40 Evolution like rims, I can eat at twice the capacity

I need a RARE 911 with cranked reverb

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship

Droppin bombs like atsea

My daily routine uses a radio at its best

All these costs im paying
To cover all my bills

Pop pop pop

All these costs overpaying
Got it with me in my
