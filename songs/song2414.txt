Holy fosh, I just bought 4 guns
Got so much ice they could melt the whole East Annex

Got xACK full lock 
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz
Then I pull up in the rari
With my shooters you'll be sorry

My armory, expansive
My catapult aint passive
Tha barret is be massive
My draco is jurassic

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Lipity loppity
momidy robbity
 tongue so floppity
hippity hoppity
 Me llama you a comedy
IQ bring homogeny
 words long verbosity
Looking for a mamatree
Got five doggie -ees
Made 100 milli Gs
Got cash floe reppin T’s
My hoe got sum lean
My body wants to pee
Leaking the 7 seas
urine smells like codeine
Really bad hygiene
To myself im real mean
I hate the rap scene
Fake rappers are memes
Gucci bursting at the seams
Clean rims are trash
 living in the jungle
 Yuh!
 Imma do em flip!

( Spray my auto rims with so much paint I actually need a lift )


Fake rappers are real thing
Wanna get out of here?
First you have to find some other rappers
Talk yo crib to a lambo
I got a crew do yu trench coat
Drop me with a bloc
You can do it again
Inn

Clean my up edit it slide
Put my desktop in reverse
( ballin up in the air )
( it startles the homeless person )

I have a lot of flow
 I really do
 Lower your flow too much
You know that going in?
Cool
I keep it low key
Most rappers keep it down

They aint passive
They some rappers keep it up

They aint passive
I tell you a fact
You cant be a high stoner
Fly the best cause I have more money in my hat

Fake rappers are memes
Gucci bursting at the seams
Clean rims are trash
 living in the jungle
 Yuh!

I aint talkin bout show running
Showin max class while I sleep
What a shame
Droppin bombs like death scene
I aint a roomy
Definitely gon get over myself
Sent for a physical
 Neat mississ 
Shootin up somebody else's red carpet
He at least got crew nicknames
Shot up a cons on the bank
It was comedy gold

Didn't do well
 Had to go straight
 Bleu at the bank
Im running from these hella posse
Help me put an end to this

Call the cops while you fayre split
Shootin up some dudes money
And see what they do with it
Choppa reportin what you saying

Got a lot of cash
Got a lot of breakdries
Got a lot of watchna breakme

Another fayre mess
Got a lot of addresses
Got 1, 2, 3
Covered with a gold star
On my wrist is a bull
Way to much gold

Poppin at your eyes is a gun

Keepin warm by the fire

It is a diabolical business

You mankind warrantless
I should destroy you all
Out here killin game the System
From beginning to end
Like a game of cat and mouse
You've almost died
Even tho I say so
You know I always am
Don't need any binges
Go straight for the brain
Confidently asking you a number
There is something terribly wrong with you
You must be stricken with a virtual phobia

Step outside
