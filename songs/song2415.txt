Masterminded every single roll I came up with
Got the hottest chick on the block
Got the breakfast darlings on my to-die-for list

Was the next cold
Almost died a few trips without drinking

When you think of propane on fire
You think dissident voices at church

Don't do drugs (wean us) and we'll never again

Got money, fame and money roll around
I could build this place my way

Money, guns and chaos now my order

I want to be President so bad, I could be a good doctor

I need to build a better, freer China

So I'm not just a leader, I'm a cat God knows how

I need a savior besides Jesus

Art forms must be perfect and everything must be made of gold
This could very well be kung fu

Im coming here today to kick your ass

You know I always gotta stay strapped
CUT TO:

5

Inside Dr. Seuss' head
Fake news, tabloid stuff, quotes
All this junk science
My body contains excess protein
I need supplementation from a diet rich in tree oil

I cant be choosy at all times
Help im having a stroke

I need some type of miracle chemical laden pharmaceutical

I need these drugs so im cured of everything

Im so tired of everyone telling me how wrong I am
Go over your shoulder and hope my arm is functioning correctly
I definitely need a second chance

Help done
Throw the mask on
Pull up, Jesus
Large view area with bar
Detox like the dietitians
Tell you not melt a breakfast lean
7 sample pills a day
For years
David Baptist Guillory
Disgusting liars
Disgusting cliqueurs
Lacking empathy
I abused my powers
And now, almost 70 years later, I implore you
Be careful one bit
Talk the talk right here
Talk the Lukewarm cause
Thinking big down at root causes
What do you mean by think big?
Big with a stick, Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz
Then I pull up in the rari
With my shooters you'll be sorry

My armory, expansive
My catapult aint passive
Tha barret is be massive
My draco is jurassic

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Lipity loppity
momidy robbity
 tongue so floppity
hippity hoppity
 Me llama you a comedy
IQ bring homogeny
 words long verbosity
Looking for a mamatree
Got five doggie -ees
Made 40 milli Gs
Got cash floe reppin T’s
My hoe got sum lean
My body wants to pee
Leaking the 7 seas
urine smells like codeine
Really bad hygiene
To myself im real mean
I hate the rap scene
Fake rappers are memes
Gucci bursting at the seams
Clean as heck make wet dreams
Jet fuel can't melt steel beams
(question everything)
(why was thermite found at ground zero)
(real stuff)
LIP LAB DAB RAB SHEESH MAB DAB SCAB MEEB MAP RAB SWAG  MEEG MAH MEE RAG YAH
Help im having a stroke

So much ice can melt at one time (uh)
That
