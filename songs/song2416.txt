Oh baby Oops
Don't know what else rhymes with bust
Bust a whole hog
Put him in a car (ayy)
Drizzle so much raisic
I cant pour the 100
Got my yahtzu hung at the top

Lyrics comin at a fever pitch
I cant keep my words

I cant process them

They all have their moments
You dont have to be macro
Streamlines the body as much as possible
Don't do drugs
They'll really mess you up
Will really mess you up

Limit my use
Underdose at will
What should have been a routine day is almost a prison sentence

I finally get over how bad of a person I am
I finally get over how stupid (uh) I sound
Im having a hard time getting over how much money
ribies, verdues, and bull****s I hold
Addiction only gets worse

I repeat, DEVI'GE
due to my drugs
nausea, flu, and rickets
Im having a hard time getting over how much cash I have
They asking for a draco cause im having a hard time finding jobs

I cant GET OVER THE FLOOR MESSAGE

I just can't get enough of you
I really must say that Im blessed because of you Im getting heavier than even small bottle

I must try and keep this a secret
I must-

I never talk trash

I just keep on saying "ayy"

ill wanna hear it and feel it

My body converts one cup of soup (nutrient dense) to 45 milligrams (calories))
