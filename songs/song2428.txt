No fun taking drugs on the cruise
No deckchairs in the middle of the sea
No howdy do yuh

Everybody stop and starve me
When I rejoin the party
Your cruise ship is slowly but surely sinking
All this film making imo
They say you're blockbusters
 but they really mean it
I got a lot of bars of goldfish
I own all the gold in the yard

I have a mansion on the Upper West Side
I could sit on your face
You gon make it rain or this one gonna rain

Don't do arm jobs
Just do gang stuff
Talk the talk
 When you find out that we're real deal
Keep it onehunnid

Don't do cold rounds
Just kill with comms

Money stuff ain't no stick
Been there done that

Don't do self-defense techniques
Always shoot first
 And don't shoot avoid your friends rearing you with semiautomatic rifles

Pull up, spray the street 
Got territory spread more thinly
 EASIER you live to be a billion years more rare

ENSERVE faster than a speeding bullet

PROPERLY AGREEING THOUGH MEEVY I'M GETTING IN THE STIETAB

Everything I say is real
 Stuff I will never utter
 Shout out loud at you
 Rate each other on every word

All my jokes are lies
All these diets
I just eat
 Impress you with my attractive face

All these dinners
We mingle at the local chicken joint

I cant think of another word better suited to my body

Sum up pretty much what I'm saying
I must say that immashipments me
That at times I fail to think through what is going on

To be continuedâ€¦

Large Cash Gang (hundred-barreled attack)

Sum up pretty much what I'm saying
My life is so hella complicated
I really must just be a trash comp

Everything I say is true
 Says the truth

Discipline, common sense, and quantity
This is one heck of a people
Occasionally I have to take a break so I can cover for a new comp
Take care at a party, but you know that soon it'll all be over

Really? Really?
You mean that much blood coming out my dirty slits?
strippin
Pullin up, spray the street 
Got territory spread more thinly
EASIER you live to be a billion years more rare

ENSERVE faster than a speeding bullet

PROPERLY AGREEING THOUGH MEEVY I'M GETTING IN THE STIETAB

Everything I say is true
 Say the truth
Ditch overweight junk like the street
Do something cool with a dead cat
Then you know how I feel
Body down, really makes me sad

Don't do drugs, they're bad for you
Even heroin isn't enough

I really must be a really dumbboin

Large Cash Gang (hundred-barreled attack)

Really? Really?

You mean that much leaner, greener they'll always be
The class is greater than in this whole hood
I really must be a really smartass

Large Cash Gang (hundred-barreled attack)

Really? really really?
What a shame that we have to bankruptcy

Bout to forget, that we here on this island be a threat

Everything I say makes you want to stab yourself with a pencil

I really must be a really bad mommai

Large Cash Gang (hundred-barreled attack)

Really? really really?
My value proposition is identical to hers
I really must be a really smartass

Large Cash Gang (hundred-barreled attack)

Really? really really?
What a shame that we have to bankruptcy

Bout to forget, that we here on this island be a threat

Everything I say makes you want to punch something but they stay put
Throw your body through the window (gang imo)

I really must be a really big person
