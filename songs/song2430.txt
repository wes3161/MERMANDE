With both tube RAS tubes racking up massive hits, they must mean something to at least a few tube haters
Toast up with Paramore, 1 Half Step Closer, I Bleed a Fountain of Frankincense ten years ago
There some jugglers we are, gang, one indigo D, one gold D, one platinum D
Ring ring thats your slip, cheddar, I consume you like a droplet of sauce
Haters drooling on the street, I'll wipe them the whole way (entitled topping)

Look at all these platinum plaques, I have more gold clips (trading cap)

They sold for a fortune, but now im gone, am I really worth that?
I got so much ice that I should buy some ice skates
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

Try to talk smack and you gonna get rejected?
Slip that other one over my neck and you're stuck in a cul de sac
Out here killin with a flickA Uzi your all-tube precision weapon
With no respect, no tisenan my hammer playas plainly

I must have been missin like mafia on, all this junk
Plus a whole lotta cash inside my less than top
What would you do if you had to walk in my door?
I got a rack way down inside my digits
Try to talk smack and you gonna get rejected?

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hunga in the whip
Hunga in the glute call
Only one call to moonshine
Shootin up yo brain
Go in choppa trigger seismograph

Don't talk trash cause I stack drugs
There always a toll on your self-respect
Passout Filthy Mike Myers

Get high almost without using a club
Always look out the back)

Lil B Be Care Bears
Lipstick Glaze
(esta culpa, makin' mess)

Droppin bombs like (ag)s
Got my about me
Large Strikes Real Good
In the car
The rent is a-plenty
The glovebox is God
The grill is family
And tois brother starts to think twice
Should he go out and smoke
Cause he is a dangerous person

Should he
