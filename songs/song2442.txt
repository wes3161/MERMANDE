Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here, hustle, cause even without a G
I got a lot of bars of gold
There never a Harlan`s Buddy in my dreams

All these platinum plaques im talkin bout
All these jets in my backyard
I need a life preserver cause im lookin at platinum plaques

I need a body bags just like in the movie

They man the look in my eye but I think they're coats
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
Ask me "BANG BANG"

I drain you of Flow and you start to hemorrhage
Droppin like ice twice as fast
I need a body suit for my crew

Your body is like a jungle log
Don't need a body sandbag
Start rollin in the Rank
Level up I go heavy cavalry
Rush in your shooters
You a threat so much bigger than a CD
Now I need the team pressure mode

The code name is McFarlane Toys

They release luscious fusions of metal

Everybody stop and starin
You demigod im in the stack

Everything on my neck is a calling

I need a brain boost
 Something wrong with me baby
Get the hell out my way
To the exit I can get back at you
After that, what you ask is having a hard time
You a fraud
You more like I should buy a home
 the crib
 the tablet

The smartphone
