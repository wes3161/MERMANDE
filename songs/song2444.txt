Xanax and lean (Izzet)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They askin where im from and what im talking bout
I just bought a yacht so im the captain now
I got so much money I could buy the Dow
Got the stendo clip and I aint never play around

Better watch what you say fore I snap
Roll up on yo crib and we go brat-a-tat-tat
Thats one for your head two for knees three for your back
Always keep in mind that snitches always come in last 

Blindin people with my rims when I roll down the street
Resturant bill be longer than a CVS receipt
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

Everyday im out here grindin stackin up that paper
You a minor league but I be ballin like rock 'n roll
All these watches never time for any kill
Everyday im like King Louis XVI

Pullin up in that military truck
Got goodspeed internet
All these gubbins aresteries
All these watches never age for any deep
I always keep it onehunnid

Pullin up in that red Benz
(ingery only)
Resturant bill be longer than a CVS receipt

What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

Everyday im out here grindin stackin up that paper
You a minor league but I be ballin like rock 'n roll
All these watches never time for any deep
I always keep it onehunnid

I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week
Everyday im out here grindin stackin up that paper
You a minor league but I be ballin like rock 'n roll
All these watches never amaze for any one song
I got so much money I could buy the office
Try to person opportunely and you wouldn't find any of the placement notices
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week
Everyday im out here to myself

Every day im outside grinding
Every day im over at the mill
Every day im gettin paid
Somebody tell you that all trash is im street
Wrong
My number one priority is the neck
Everything else is almost nonexistent
Do you already own the Benz?
