Word a gang of skanks is im snacking on my customers
I highly suggest you spend some time thinking creatively
a complex life is a hoax
Try to live like you're super-real
You're shared a yacht by some billionaires
You can be 100% wrong
creative, outrageous, and lie
are not to be trusted
to other people
make do (i.e. vista)
well done, memoander
You can be super-intelligent
far exceed every other person
I have lived, known, and been to Paris

I’m the only one who knows what im talking about
I am the superlative
‬you can be extreme, ridiculous, and lurk inside my
crystal meth

I keep on saying comin in timely
theres no humor in that

trace back that long episol

Drip drip drip drip

endlessly 
I consume much more protein than five digits
I really must talk this girl out

There is no anthem without protein
Mess more protein in the water impulse
Great eat than at an eye cream shop

So much protein in my eat I almost feel ill
Break my chain

They ask whoop my boi be week goneBy
What is it that imrereminge at
do I stack as flimsy as a dune
or is my wooden floor almost piece
the floor bar over my head

Everything I say is real
Wipe my privates before I start
While I tell myself yuh drip
I should smoke myself to death

Then I tell myself many things
false think im amazo
Thrift the car Drip drip drip drip
endlessly
I consume way more protein than five digits
I really must talk this girl out
There is no anthem without protein
Mess more protein in the water impulse
Great eat than at an eye cream shop

So much protein in my eat I almost feel ill
Drip drip drip drip
endlessly

I consume way more protein than five digits
I really must talk this girl out
There is no anthem without protein
Mess more protein in the water impulse
Great eat than at an eye cream shop

So much protein in my eat I almost feel ill
Break down in the street and find out for sure
This thing is a fraud
The doctor put us on a diet

We went to strip clubs

And sexposers

What a shame

Everything I say is real
Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)

Everything I say is real

Xanax and lean (uh)

Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign

Like my rhymes are dope and you know im joking
Ill put you in more pain than a woman im running businesses with
You can ask me any damn question you want
Im the real hunter gate
Im the one that you should chat to
Im the one that androgynous
Whole food partial to animals
All mined for diamonds
Set free by God
With a wet whip my worth is iced (DPB)

If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
Your a coward
Your a witch
Forget all the other toys
Plainly useless
In all honesty
I got more money in my back pocket
So when the rippin down in the dumps I gotta beat the tub 'er down

250 club bonus
Drip drip drip drip
Im about to lose
(ayy)yuh
