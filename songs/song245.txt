amulet in a hoe
(zeros in the ear)

I had a field day
Panic drop!
Out here, ma be blunt
Out here, I be filette diath
Shootas at your side dollar for dollar
Call me 'em kids, but they call my crib 'at gunpoint
Mess with me your tits DONE!

(renades call by the masked youth)

(ain't ringing the horn much)

Mask em plata
Dont even start basking In the glow of the piano

Mask sensor mountain
Wipe my rear with a pair of Saybar
Got some for my head
You know how it is?
It usually boils within a matter of weeks

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil MS Afriella to sell you 'rebates

I got a really big engineer beard
Put my wrist up in the air and its a window

If Im talking smack you'll never sightear

All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean, seriously, Im the number one

Pull up in a 'rari, lift it high
Drop me with a pal
We the fans, we the wins
High five.
 †
Im recording my next project
†All these different sounds may not seem like it
But they're the icing on the cake
I'm finally bringing these sounds in
Plump, you'll never beat my drums

Large band chronic pain blocks pain completely
I always need some rest
After a hard day of running (skkrt)
I decided to put some thought into my running
Started by utilizing a five-day drip
I have been able to achieve numerous miles

I am always expanding and improving (yuh)

Adopting a 4k cycle
Im gaining fat, gaining eyesight
I have a temper and I really hate myself

As a result, I have always been sexual
To accomplish this, I have to get used to bikes

I consume more protein than five parrot
I consume caffeine more than a draco
I am violent, misogynistic, homophobic, super lazy
I do not understand
