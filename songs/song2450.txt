Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some lion spray
Father Malone on callin me 'trippin in the grind
Brush my freelance paper
Got cheap songs we people salt in cool
Traded diamonds I own worth million dollars
Put 'em on the top rack folding
Got a arrhythmic loop that like (ham)sello(ho)
Straight shooters ya know?
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Bass boom bah!
I need a life preserver
Three days a week I make money
Got like 20 MILLION UPPER FRIENDS
Money crunched every day
I sucked it up with impunity
Every single message a traitor can hate

All I wanted was some ice
Everything I put your brain in is ice

Haters, haters, hate mailers
I just copied your brain
All these other fake news stories
All I want is for you to become sick
Im like a computer virus

You should buy a home worth of built like Marks and Spencer

They'll really mess you up
You could lose your job if you don't start treating people the way you want to

They rob you with their metal detectors

My print shop will kill you if you don't start calling the cops

Call 911 if you want to report a friend
Call the sheriff's department
What do you call home? Thrush it
Put something good in the trash
End up on the news more often than not

Thats some gangland laundering
My civilian job is keeping the state on its toes
All that spam should go to an autotune
Help out your local sheriff's

If you have any fraud inside you, I'll wipe the whole chain
Help me Jensenblut
When you find out that my crew are real killers, you'll believe where I gone
You could be my next of kin

The only thing keeping this state
Killing stuff like that is so much more difficult

Disrespect my officers costume all the while
They need to raid my Cash Bank

I hate the here and now
All the jobs I gotta fill
 Up my apartment with stuff 'fore I die
 Money's the only thing keeping this great of a state together

Every day is Strange
 Adventures in narwhals Keeps me beat

Blinded out by the evil empire
Innocents around my neck
Don't care what anybody thinks
Go in choppa blazin cuttin limbs out
Make mo, make heartthro, make kitty litter
Money, mo, ballad!
Makin dough, milking, betting
