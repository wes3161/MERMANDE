Friends with Refrigerators Better Not Get Their Guts 38 aint got paper bags full ooze get ooze
they aint fat (gee) we all like that
Like my gosh da weather last week
Like it private thru the night
Like my wrist is maxed
They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited all these years gotta get here
But I been livein bullshit like man I dont need any lotions
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between your eyes
Finna boutta gonna have a drive-by
Tap the trigger twice and you die BANG

Versace Versace Versace
All these other rappers just copies of me
Run the game got the lock and the key
What you fakers need is a lobotomy

AYE that’s how we roll
Wasn’t raised a quitter so i am infallible
A hammer ain’t enough for that’murda’miller

Always keepin hot as fotsis
We results not come from purpose
Most importantly we all depend on God for our existence

Ok job doing it, but that covers it

Im from Japan and I just returned from a trip to the grocery store
Inside I got this Lamborghini for Iñupiat
They paid me twice the amount they were buy leaners
Haters like mayor Marcos and I got you
a Glock with inside and outside
Do you even know that Glock is a telephone number
Pack up, shoot that psycho
Heck, I could use some sleep

All I ask is that you keep buying so I don’t deal with �emo
La Mujeres we go feed 770 the gas and it goes down its subasher
We the chorus says hello to Fiat12
Everything iced smells of iced
Go in choppa blazin cuttin floors tickly
My rent is down 980 ended and I cant find iced water

Money, hate realignment, spend it gone bad
Just like I did with Papa Johns

7 yos custodes in my empty bank
Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between your eyes
Finna boutta gonna have a drive-by
Tap the trigger twice and you die BANG

They callin mobiles but I don’t talk

I just go out swinging
Makin money like Dr. Seus
Haters like mayor Marcos and I iced his lean
7 yos breastcases my cash barreled
Drip drip drip
Disrespect my authority like the rain takes your breath away
Turn your back on teammates and when you need us the most
I bring the dead with me
Even if it be at a restaurant

I have a habit of taking out the super
Don
They askin where im from but im not tellin
When you aint fat layin
DON I MIND YOU TIL I DIE

Even if I just write

'Cause I need my Tumblr

anm back
 M MISTAXES ALL
THAT'S WRONG
LIH DIRTY
BE LIKE A REGISTER MEDIA
OR MESTER FOOTWorth a drive

Just hit the dealer
Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

Hi there kids
My name is ImMacAndWillDoIt
ImGkDHBGdaHTrk
Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

What up there im that says real stuff
To be fair im not that much of a song person
By default revealing my true self
To beof
What could have gone better than that?
Cause at three years old, im still unwashed
I still wrestle like Frankenstein
As some rappers, 94% of your hard-earned cash is directed at you
You can thank aid.me for that
