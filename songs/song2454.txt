What a shame that even though I say so
The debt, the emptiness, the isolation

I must stop and ask myself these three questions

What would I do differently?

I with a big voice,
say what you will
If you want to fight, go ahead and fight
Make doughnuts, make do doughnuts
I need your help a lot

I need your help more times than not
