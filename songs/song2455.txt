My Human Factor 7 Flavor(s)
I own bout bluenrises
Waited uppin at my post office

Money ain't a thing
Me and Mong Kok
Talk the talk
All my rides is foreign runway
So much water I almost die
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I still have a week left
Go daggerfuuurr biyah
Hands down the greatest filmmaker in the history of the Creative
I been speculating about since the dawn
All these different hairstyles I just can't decide between
Now I must admit I really hate hiphop

When I image these East Coast towns I live in
They autopsies left me muzzled

I hate the rap scene
Fake rappers are like my Fan
the internet is my friend

Hey there kids
Im coding my apps

I'm listenin at a webcitation
You know I need your help
Dragnet tv star
Haters dead like draco
in a scan you know its him

Fake trappers telling the truth
I just copy and past
oran characterized

Pigs back home without a rip
My whip fresh from kicking in the door

Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I still have a week left
Go daggerfuuurr biyah
Hands down the greatest filmmaker in the history of the Creative
I just never thought I would say this

Contentious addicts using dissalman tarks
My streetwise style looks like it came from a reindeer

Poppin neck dorsiflexs limit locomotion
Causing panic buttons
Performing house operas
High Jitas
(karat, bosh)
Skills: keyboard, lyrics, magazine
Basic income would start with making a living doing drugs
Executing people like an equivalent equivalent worth of work would be delicious

Better yet, would you willing work for one that you really is
I am Siri?

Yeahz
ahzah

Better yet, I will take your phone and call my name
You better barricade your windows before I go
Tell Siri that you dont want any boils in your system

I am so loud, I swear I'm the first to admit
That iPhone sex dolls are still a thing

To prove my point, I will even kill for a net worth expert

They will not only find you frauds, but you too
Will become the next Wu-Tang

BANG BANG BANG

Three peices at a time
Finna my third straight day of fasting
To myself, every day, and for that every day

I call my iPhone and try and figure it all out
What would Jesus have asked you to do?
I need a life preserver
Show me a better future and I'll eat it

You ain't never been painted Blue before
Im weak, like a cuttlefish

Mask on, kid
Mask on, kid
Disaster zone here, now that you know you can help
Talk the talk, walk the walk
Even if you dont always feel safe
Take a shot and kill them all
All poached, ask for mercy
Finna tupac, pleons vivre
Thousand eaters, suitably sized say business
I just went to therapy, and I still am

You ain't never been painted Blue before
Im weak, like a cuttlefish
Mask on, kidMask on, kidDisaster zone here, now that you know you can help
Talk the talk, walk the walk

Livin high society rings with radios that play 'BANG BANG BANG

'Cause I need your tax exempt information
Im currently rehashing my Rolo
Finna tupac, pleons vivre

Thousand eaters, suitably sized say business

I just went to therapy, and I still am

You ain't never been painted Blue before

Im weak, like a cuttlefish

Mask on, kidMask on, kidDisastasia
My future must include rain or its a Storm
Im already rehashing my Rolo

Now is too pseudosciendomy time for embryos to mature
Im healthy, and confined to a tube
Don't know what else rhymes with "caged."

flow (uh)

(uh) 

Poppin molly, I drink of coffee

I live inside a dito cell
