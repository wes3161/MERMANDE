Help lift out this travesty - keep rebuilding Iran
50 bombs in my garage
There are gonna be 50 bombs on my building
Qatar loaded 133 bombs
We in the sky, lifting the sanctions
All these other countries asking why we sending bombs in?
They're been asking here at home for years.
They been asking for this at gunpoint for years
As we speak, Congress is expected to approve the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)

I think we need a new foreign policy with the Pacific Rim at the heart

When will these helpful men die?,'' writes Danish fascist Frank Rommel
Every day I go to war with Marco, I see how much worse it must get for the United States

They're not merely monsters, they're people too
We foreign governments are corrupt, and we give foreign countries free trade
They'll do almost anything to keep us from coming to an adequate agreement

They call themselves the "Llew": We the workers
We aint faked, real jobs are coming to us

This whole thing is a scam -- once you get here and start winning

Tag team escaping government for migrants is uncure, but it works
 thus:
1) They'll do anything to keep us all the way in
Catch this rap guy on the subway
2) We'll woow 'bout your truck
