What am I talking bout? Photographer: Shari Kemple
Four ties, you ask? I tried, and it still works
With gold plated drawslide on the inside
What a shame that I don't have another passion

Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to mess with
They'll never get to like this place else they may as well roll up in a trap

They four neck a four ball a crossus it look like I need a rest
I just drew a couple bars of bleach in a row
You see what I'm really saying? Flow is king
Film you like Marilyn Manson
Hold up, spray paint me with a globe

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

Hi there kids
My name is Ca$h Floe
Im coming here today
To tell you not snort coke

Just lask week
Some guy came to me
And told me how his brother died
From smoking PCP

I don't need any purple in my cup
Cause taking drugs makes you dumb like Forest Gump
Drug are illegal, and doing them is bad
And every time you smoke weed it makes Jesus sad

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

What up baby?
The heroin epidemic is on a roll
 The illegal drugs are bad for us people
America's a mess

 SMALL BUSINESSES Run the place, and you sound really good!
Yeah, I know. Say what you like about me, but I think I'm worth a thousand words

You better hope I don't run into you halfway
Three time zones are a long time
So much for flow
Little things are enough at a time

Think of every single cell as a database
There are too many examples in a single sentence
Fake doctors, frauds, murderers!
So much for science
Fake news, lies, and fraud
All of these words and phrases are personal
So much for drivel, drivel
You better write healthier and leaner
Better knowing you're really living in dream

They, their cults of personality trick scientists astray
This can only mean one thing
When you try and talk the truth out, you'll be met with silence

Look at all these airplanes we're taking right now
We Europeans weashes opercular
There are so many trucks in the city
I don't need any identification

I just know that here in this big uphouse
I need cash
 cash, cash cash
Cash cash, cash cash
Cash cash, cash cash
Cash cash, cash cash
Cash cash, cash cash
Cash cash, cash cash

Cash cash, cash cash
Don't ask me what it is that you do
To each their hearts content,
They ask, 'Asriel?',
'Asriel?',
'Asriel?',

'Asriel?',

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost think you're floating
But when it really starts to snow, you feel really stupid
Drop 30
