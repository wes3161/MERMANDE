Electrifying

Most people cant find it in their brain that many rappers just dont make it to the end
7 takeas the speakers arent enough
I cant get them to sing
They aint hiphop
All I do is cause flow
Everything I say is worth a dozen doggones
Ring ring thats yo girl on the telephone
Tell her you can get car batteries at autozone

Quadruple cup oh my
5 Broke Girls Bound Earlier
Pullin up in that Land Rover
So much sediment in the air
I can't breathe

I should've been at the bank

I should've been on the radio
Im just at the bank
Pull up in that Land Rover
Brilliant!

FGmercy call me that clip sex

Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me cruisin down the street you know its a challenge

You know whats taking my brain

Cause fluctuating positivity emotions makes
To myself im banking my life on it

Cause if its not for me, its because

Ive always tried to be humble
And im saying that again

Count 'er, I don't need your grunt work
Cause enough of your cronyism

Grows up in mega-projects
Give 'em all a lotta dough
Quadruple cup ooh
Money mean
Lacking dopamine

I should've been more analytical
Instead I just went with pure chance

Started to get desperate
Then I Rejected They Versace
60 Count 'em, I Spent It All That Time
Making a New Bassline
Adding in the Monkees Feat. Ca$h aa
Robb Cantrell
The only person that I think I'm 1) quite capable of taking this
2) I can really rock this
Help open some lines and we'll settle for one
Hella Billy Ocean
or something
large LCD display
Don't do drugs
Guaranteed that someone else will find it
So that you're never caught
Never a bigger pain in my neck than knowing that this could end up in the net
Try as I may, I just can't put my finger on any of its
deralks

Got some more for myself
