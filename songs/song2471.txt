Offers unconditional love
To anyone with a 911
They may not like you, but you must never mess with us

They callin the shots, but you stay with them

I dont give a hoot
11 Cents a Night
Bet you a cause you mess with my brick

Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see
Hella grape juice, clear pee
Trigger femmies make em REE (ree!)

Haters mess with my cup and we MetCries (ZAERlz)

Covered in red - a reference to President Donald Trump

My whip amases bother some would kill to kill
Funny thing is that im so plump that im thru it

I cant think of any words that describe how unique my whip is

A pleasure to be a guest
So far so good
Looking forward to my first 500 yards
200 yards today
Covered in red - a reference to President Trump
My whip amases mess with my body - I can feel it - giving out tiny clinkes
My whip is like wildfire against the rapacious West
Infected nations are upon us
We in the U.S.A.
Put your body in a car compactor, taking out the trash like Jimmy Hoffa
You know how I am
Bastards do it all, breaking into other bands?
That would be bizarre
My whip is like lightning -- it strikes anything it touches
My favorite part is buying drums
I always like to buy knockoff cars
Drive by the brake line
And every time I pull out a old car
Is it a 2014 Impreza 911?!

I need your help, Patriots!
Submit stolen images / Videos illegal / Offenders include, murder, assault, electioneering, alcohol, prostitution, loitering
Lies, murder, robberies, dalliances, car thefts, broken windows
Lied conspiracies, drug dealing, lashing out at the police
My whip is like an oncoming magazine that I should duck?
Maybe I should buy some gloves?
Fake tattoos, ritually necrophilia, and compulsive taking drugs make my codeine high even worse?
Maybe I should put some heroin on myself?
Maybe I should buy another glove?
Pull out my gun and shoot you on the spot
In person, I am almost always found guilty
I possess a banned contraband (escanto)
One of my illicit drugs (lushlove)
Excessive doses (epistol) cause rapid heart rate variations?
What could be more dangerous than taking my medicine?
Take less than Shabbat or fast food and you could expose Yourself to Chemtrails?
I consume extreme amounts of caffeine every day for numerous years now
