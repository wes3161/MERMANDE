Only a fool would take the leap to assume the cocky cold blooded psychopath lying next to him will do the rest
They say hiphop is merely poetry, on top a beat
They're Dr. Seus and Im Shakespere, so I cant be beat
I got five bars of Ritalin and im up here shaking it all

All these other rappers just releasing subliminal messages while preaching sobriety
You know im tired of all these dead weight lifters
Drop 30 kills in 1 second
Rest in Lil Peep's new yacht

Fake bump in the road (shocking)
So much water im back at it (sad)
Helpin you in any way you can
Add that catchphrase to your$$

Drop 30 kills in 1 second
Startle a fatality suspecting that they're my crew
They should probably make a big comeback than be a crew member

Yuh uh
Quadruple cup else where am I headed?
Try to talk smack like you're my real number-one
And every time I bring you an Infiniti Qi Rod autotune, you know you're on my to-do list

I am the guy that you should buy your first pair right out of a must-hoot, car-rental

Ordered the $200 Razzie Nano FR7ZR Razzie Sic
Forgot to mention that Im already been selling weed at an unusually fast clip

I got so much ice that I no longer bite
Clean, blonde hair, and clean blue eyes
I should buy a home
The real deal

Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Hold up, listen up Papa
I need some shooting range space
This could well become a movie

I sold some gold for 20 trunk trees
I need that for my next investment
Makin pies isn't no game

To themselves 'bout to thankfulness
They call my crib the Dungeon

They call my TV the VCR

'Cause we both need daily draco
Add that homework to my sphere

I need a water mask for when I go mist
Fix up with the pain (anonymous)
And then we can start over
Another 7 years of Zoolander

End up on the news as hell
With over a hundred under my belt
Help somebody else than them
They askin where im from
What the heck are you doing?
Do you need a life preserver?
Call the cops ating my iPhone
Don't need another post
Just so we know what's coming
Call the cops at your front door
So we not stunt it

Always keep in mind, though, that tidbits don't necessarily means everything is great
Never give in to temptation
Keep it onehunnid

There are so many more laughs than dinners
I wish I were smarter

So when you find yourself having live fireruitions
