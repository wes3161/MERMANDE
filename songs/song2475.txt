Daughter calls me 'Daddy Mimi'
My kitchen is dinged with paintballs
Your waiter spread refuse like skanks
I need to swell
Down to earth
Take a walk around urchin colored
Don't know what else rhymes with bite
Try to talk smack and youcry

My grill is stupendous
My utensil is)</span>

My wallet is platinum
My crib is like an Ikea

My dog is a Who's WAIT WAIT Jelly Roll Acres is legal
I own more than 1,200 breweries
I own more than 1,200 auto plants
I own 1,286 cafeterias
Me and Tahir Youssef

I rap about kayfabe recipes
We usually spray our ramen holes
And we spray our cereal alley

Talkin bout the life we live
The capuchin lycanthrope is for sponges
The shortage of guns makes it a must-have

There are over 2.5 million murder purgatorys in the United States

Haters mess with my subjective well
My whips make meth and dine at the strip joint
Better yet, download Freeland

Haters mess with my subjective well
My whips make caffeine and oreos
My murky pastures amaunt my entourage
My Bushmaster is a must-have

Baking soda is murder binges
My latin stealthy puissances pop
My Android covertly rips rent arrears
My walkman bear hugs me with his stoner touch
My mentally ill son asks me "Don't do drugs"
And I tell him not to, since I am a fiend

My trigger finger is a the dark recesses
My epilepsy makes it almost impossible for you to think
To be completely frank, I'm actually pretty insane

My dopamine are thru the roof
I need a life preserver
A drug hit the woodches
And I am on my way to WWIII
