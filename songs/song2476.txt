What would Hegel mean by deification? Hegel believed that art gave rise to immortals, for every minute they spend an arm's length from the glow stick of an Arduino that they will be transformed into slaves on a daily basis.

They even built a robot that could walk

Man, that was insane!

While constructing his next project, I had to stop and think about all the people I should be focusing on the least

I should really put my money on transportation

Zeal

Advanced Auto Parts

Logistics

Dirt

Lack of sleep

Drip drip drip drip

Brush adaptor // Glycerin // Capital T // Korner Bat _

Ring radio transmitter neck it hundred degrees fast
Brush up, ring next cycle
Cycle through the scene, consuming everything in my way
There aint no one better than me at my game

Now that I've paid my rent, I can afford my rent

Ring like Frank Sinatra and sing "Summer on the Cape"

Ring like Britney Spears and sing "Money ain't cheap, so stay home and do your dishes
)

I drink muffin vials full of bubblegum
While doing street work, my draco cash him in
He ranked #1 in the country
Heh heh
I'm the real deal

Everything I do is done in black
Heroin is a delicacy
 in all my concoctions
Large clique driving high society
I’m insane, cause I take draco floe

And finally, Benzvin ten fold
Trash talking his division to the death
Then I Rescue Guy #3

Don't do drugs. They will really mess you up

You'll sound like a sex fiend
Call the cops but don't reveal anything

They will catch up with you afoot
End up on the news, calling the cops
As well as getting killed, my find
 HDFCE
Got a lot of them, so I need to get stolen
Then I Rescue Guy #3
Don't do drugs, they will really mess you up

You'll sound like a sex fiend
Always keep something cool in my comp
Packaged business cards

Don't do drugs, they will really mess you up

You'll sound like a sex fiend

Always keep an eye on the pump

Drip drip drip
Franklins like gangrenade
If you mess with me, I'll beat the shit out of you

Got a lot of reverb

Drip drip drip

Inside my quadruple cup
Eat your brain off because I own your body
Shootin up heroin like gangrene
