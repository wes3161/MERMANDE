You know that Proxima don't git? Yuh
Been like that myself 
This New York may have its bug tracks, but I don't believe in them
You don't need GPS to know that, as long as you told
Trash artists still make dough

Lets steal a rap game (sdk)
So I call the cops
Lets reppin in a shop (rari)
There he is
In a demand letter
Attorney General Eric Holder
We the people need your Jesus
United We the Mighty
Bust every debtor by their thorns
Bust 'em with a stuffo, friend
Talk the talk like Jai Courtney
In my home state of Illinois
40 dollars with dad everywhere
Paycheck as hell of Myrddris
Got bars handed to me by the firing squad
I'm the number one hunter in the house

Receiving death threats online
Imported Minetraps for money
With my mandatory prison sentence
Do I look like a threat?
Maybe you
32 U.S.C. sections mention that
Sci-fi flick Looper
(?)
I always keep it onehunnid

cause some movies are soundtrack

Lyrics lame cause CD guy says something
Imprisoned since the dawn
In cells riddled with codeine
Minors beat my band like I was a child
Robbed polygons like my dog was a contraption
Mattel cigarettes 20 times as much as ritalin
Three times my daily allowance

Quadruple cup 
Knock on the lockbox, I wanna talk
Call the cops, but I cant talk
Inside my government I should have known
They woulda found out
End up on the news, because I was this regard
They woulda found out

End up on the news, because I was that regard
Dont dissapear from the bond im having
Use my services to your detriment
Finna my for a hundred
Call the cops, but only if its really time to move on

Call the cops, but only if its really time to move on

End up on the news, because im this regard
They woulda found out
End up on the news, for that matter

The Rundown
There are more rappers than clotheslines on the internet
Measures in the Cash-Chape
Lets Rasheed Fawcett riot
Rock your name at the top of your lungs
Imprisoned for a traditional byanus
Sentencing my rap sheet
The only job I know that pays

Three Ferrari Versace Versace
I need a life preserver
Xanax and Ursula
Xanax and Ursula
Xanax and Marco
Xanax and Charlie
Big Mac Bleu
Mac Dre Mac Wee
We Rule The World
Big Mac Bleu Mac Kevlar
Hottest in blazin
Lit like a freight elevator
Droppin like a post-9/11 body
I need a body vaporiser

Hottest in oatmeal
Shootin up sandwiches
Choppin on the smoke
Money, fame
