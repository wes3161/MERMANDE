Diamonds on her forehead
I cant think of any language that identifies her with any other than English

A woman's place of rest should be their home

Disabling checks at gunpoint
Pull out a new BMW 7800
Speed bump pullin at me

Reminds me of an arcade

Shootin up something new
Add that with that vibrator

Drip drip drip
Disabling checks at gunpoint
Pull out a new Porsche 911

My wrist is massive
My diet is based on PALH

Diamond dust pervasive
My diet makes me sick
