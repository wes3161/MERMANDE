Every artist we talk to is different and we ask them a lot of questions
They ask this a lot and they're relentless
We talk hip hop, blues, pop
We spend our days wandering the street doing drugs
But the thing is, nothing can compare to the energy and enthusiasm of a live audience

We rappers are instantly recognisable from billion-selling radio plays

We vape, even though I don't sell anything

I'm somebody else's cup of tea, so I don't need your largesse
We new scene rap acts could use some serious coaching

Most rappers, rappers afk so much loyality that they beat up on their besties
They askin where im from and what im talking bout
I just bought a yacht so im the captain now
I got so much money I could buy the Dow
Got the stendo clip and I aint never play around

Better watch what you say fore I snap
Roll up on yo crib and we go brat-a-tat-tat
Thats one for your head two for knees three for your back

Lacking in the knowledge that we here at Gracie Know-it-Alls
Put my stuff in a backseat so I don't end up like a clean
So when you see me cruisin down the street, I gotta slip a cash-line
Pay my debts in full and I aint never gonna live to see my pay

Who says no one can take dreams as real accomplishments?

Don't need any further motivation than when you see me dissolving companies
Droppin bombs like an enemy coalition

I own every inch of Las Vegas and I'm PVPin every street 
Online begging is what makes Ares true

I have a racket in my name that can rip up a homeboy
20 illegal guns in a matter of days
I need your body samples so that I can make another Manifesto

What makes 'em so oddly pleased? They say 'mere hope' but in doing so leave so many swindlers at 'foreseeing me

Most homeless people live in encampments
Many remain homeless for years

Some die each day
From suffocation inhalants
To the 3, I count you
7
Everyday are repetitive patterns

I keep on coming
While you pass me by

And my hungry guard breathlessly
I pull out my stendo stick
To guard against illegal immigration
And to prevent any misunderstandings
I have numerous build-a-gun canteens
To protect you from whatever is coming your way
Keep on coming back

Father forgive them, for they do not know death is coming
Father fast for us departed demons await us
They will crush us like avalanche monsters
Bust 'em up like cars batteries
