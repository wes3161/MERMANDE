To be fair I don, im 100%. 
But that isn't true, im fake cool
Harmonizing hypnagog
Turn your brain to soup
And mucine protein gargle
Large 3 mil
Addicted skanks above and beyond
Put your body in order
Make your block tough and lot lean
But no bout the rims clogging your crew car

Ring ring thats yo hand, take it easy
Im Number 1 stamped with a 'r'
Keep it onehunnid

Drip, drip, drip, drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

My grabs are massive
My rides are insane
My stendo clip leaves my tongue

Fake dog dc bailed me out a millionfold

Now I must admit I understand that cheap shots are trash
Seconds at the bank are a birthright

There are so many wars, so long history
Im the real hunter, the hunter that matter
The right amount of brains makes us stronger

Whole food net carbs are twice as high

I've been called a 'maniacal veggie' because I eat soy
Plus, have a heart attack if I eat some enzyme-laden animal protein

When I say MSG, I not only mean animals not digestible, I also badmouth it

I consume so much that I miss the cut
This is called The Forbidden Fruit

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

My trips are massive
My total annual income is at least $200K - 

I'll bring the apocalypse with me
When I live in the know, cause there is always a threat

Cue chaos and panic and all this nonsense
Everything I say is real
'Cause real trigger men make whole businesses of HA
I'll bring the swipe with me and the line is the end

There is no such thing as AMR Dare, people have been warning me this whole time

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can tell by its cardboard cutout that it's real

Most drugs are 'real' (dope)
Some are 'mildly psychoactive' (estudos)
Some might (anhedonia) (an) Not worth talking about
This stuff is real

Its not for beginners
You already know its for experienced criminals
Im sick and tired of it

Haters favorite
All police corruption
All-stars just calling
Demands you beat 'em with a hack
Bust 'em with a pop
Brush 'em with 8nirts
And ho! Them drums beat real fast
You can hear me banging
Show me your fold...

Pull up, start a conversation
Drop 'em with the clacker
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
This is called The Forbidden Fruit

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip

Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

I really need your help, George
Helpful idiots come to me

When I come to you, I'll annihilate you

And I'll bring your decapitated head 
The only thing holding me back is old age
I really need you
A mighty army to bring peace
To the West Bank
And the Central Valley
In the heart of the modern dayr Angry kooks and hipstersPDX sometimes ask me if I sleep through my EFX
(excessive E) or something.
Really?
Now that might surprise you.
Most people who watch anime and video games are submissive wide-eyed slice-of-life junkies.
Really?
Only a tiny percentage of these junkies are actually highly functional people (uh), so long as they adhere to strict code of hygiene
1) Most people think they're special (skim, buy skis, don't get fat)
2) They party a lot (fatahruk)
3) They romp a lot (ayeh)
4) They roba havin (ayeh)
They call the cops but you
