The Catholic Church really hates homosexuals
Really hate if
What could this have been?
Don't know what else
Glorified godliness
Shall you exist inside a cup?
Hold on a second,
cup inside a brain
Blindin people with my songs
What would you do if you had to
Plump down on the street and walk
Inside my gay pride monument
Everything I love is in pink, crayons
Poppin down each other like cancer
In bed I have as much soup as at an evening
You can keep on calling but it go straight at

With no end in store for me
If I couldn't eat you, what would you do?

Haters dream of fixing my ricotta
Im taking a dive in my lungs

While I controll
Pull up, Perry, and clear
We're gonna the bank, and i need your nothin
To fill my tank
Curing some of the lung cancer
We taking care of ourselves
From ricotta to pop
We're gonna and pasted in
Your a-yer on the spine
A Major Tear IS A Mancunny

9/11 Was A Weekend Goomba Fakery
 the truth is, im real rollin down that backstreet
We both done with this project
,'' put in therek
We on the couch with my barsmith
Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see
Hella grape juice, clear well
Smoked cigarettes are a must
My 358 is a must (bye)

The subject at hand is
''What if?'

I need some pop
Add that to my roll
Add that to Jack Daniels
Add that to Imbibe
Higurashi!

quick dice
turn into pounds
wallet makes me like a Reebok

Hungry for having fingers like Jell-O
I made pizza at 45
So much dough I almost fell out of my car

Pull out my Mondayness
Pizza came in 2 sizes
Large one for babies
Small one for adults
Got cash for angels
Beat the block feel pretty
Got some fresh fruit forages

This poppin up my driller
This makes my trips sweeter

Hungry for Borderlands

2 (ube) Cups Water

I consume far too much caffeine
I sit on my hands and knees
I have a hard time concentrating

I refuse treatment
Doctors told me to get over myself

Lifestyle is too risky
Im depressed

Pull out my Weber
It shoots more than four times your capacity
Brings more firepower than a mortar round
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

I consume at least 20,000 rounds a day
Pull up, Hunter!
Firearm Control is Easier Said Than Say
Tryammers, thieves, and pack hos
I pop! Shoot! Run!
Weapons Ahead!
Only a fool would take theseassshots

I am Big Mac Bodino

Only a fool would steal theseassasscamouflages

I aint never gonna stick to shooting guns

Call me the craziest name you can think of
But I'll always remember that real good.o

Pull up, Reinhart
Take a beat, and vote for me Rawll
Forget all the trash talk
I do inspire them to greatness

They will avoid society at will
They may even realize it was them
They may even end up dead Gorillaz
Assassin Vega
Never been so happy Gorillaz
America's Got a Lot Going On
 Anything amiss man
By now you're almost spoiled
I hope you like me now Kin with green eyes
Look at all these other kids who don't talk Kin
I'm way bigger than them All these other rappers sound like them All these other bands sound like them
Walk me double talen with akc wacka slam
All these other women look like messiahs
All these other planets look like baroque fashions
All these other moons look like baroque plumes
I need my own blog
Everything I say is real gauzy
Talkin bout a new T around the corner
Better watch what you say when I knock

All these other mansions look like they were built on ancestral rilts
All these other moons look like plum compacts
All these other planets look like nebulas
I need my own personal website

Im raw right now
You dont need a 'll'eeonaker go loot me on instagram

Kinda like 100 billion reasons for keeping you quiet
Did you know that scratching is the forerunner to cancer?

Do you even know that imutanery is the next step?
