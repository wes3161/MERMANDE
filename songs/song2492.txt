Rebelling Females
The only cool thing about her is she never smells like your snort
Adorable woman with shade under her platinum blonde bangs
Mo, like, cam in the molly
Sendin shots through your body and like im shootin at you
I dont need your money
Sendin the body posin in my hood

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies, each day of the week (gang gang)
Poppin molly, you know i never sleep (no i dont)
Got money, money money money (large cash)
Straight shooters, you know we we aint funny (kevin hart)
Your girl need vitamins, i give her sunny d (nutrients)
She aint your girl, if she coming home with me (large cash)
Number 1, hottest in the street (heatwave)
Litas, voodoo, folk music, snare sax
What up, ho?
Try to stop me, but I aint got no go
Started 6 years hip-hop, use asagne
And more
But stop once and for all
I aint letting you use that
Drive yourself to you sleep (doctor opossums)

'Cause I need your illusion
 Journal, interjection, snort
Drive yourself to you dreams
While you comatos
Hungry for some tranquillity
I call the cops but you dont have to
 I aint letting you find 4, yes
Soon you will know
Angels are real murderers
Fake news is real fraud
The truth is that every true politician is a shill for corporatism
And every big senator is a fascist

If we as a society want sanity, we need a leader ima form government

To keep our peace, we need a constitution

To keep the whip running, we need a new Act

Every man for her bears one child
That can't walk
She swears by Him all the time

She wants to be a very hermaphrodite
She splits into two tribes (mercenary)
And each is hers alone
She knows what it is like to be a half-sister
To do them all is to commit murder
That's what it is in this day and age

Everyday while hoeing

I have to leave you with this (ayy)
There and back me up with it
With or without you
Another day at the party, another tale

I need you again in my life
Cry already from the ice, for I need your help
Swear in the name of Jesus, put my life on hold

When I pop the LAB, you know I'll come
Three for one, one for all
Help my people get the change
Add that watercraft to your breakfast (Rosa), or that jar of chapstick (I'm running late)
I really must say that Texas
What a wonderful climate!
This being Mexico, you must bring a large family!
We new residents, even though we're Central Americans!

Haters, mean guys, white people, and disabled people all get in the way
We needing to get big, mean, red
And I'm sorry, but you don't live in the state I live in

If I were you, I would attack and kill you like the dog I am

I am so violent, I could carry this state like a ring

Everyday while I'm out here killing, thinking about me
Three for one, one for all! Help my people get the change

Add that watercraft to your breakfast (Rosa), or that jar of chapstick (I'm running late)

I really must say that Texas

What a wonderful environment!

This being Mexico, you must bring a large family!

7 rollies, each day of the week (goldbok), purple canadeas (cheap tricks), and goldboots (I'm running late)
Live in fear, that you never way remember me
You clowns isn't go. ,,,,,waited so long since that condo I was on

I need you now or never
X
Don't need any art, just know that I'll never entirely disappear
In the jungle like Filthy Rich Boy
Put my hands up and say hello
Finally giving in and moving on
Life is silly, and we realy all dreams
