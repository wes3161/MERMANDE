I hate the rap scene
Fake rappers are memes
Look at all these platinum plaques
You know they aint cheap (AYB)
Hold up, rhyme with me
Codeine injections keep rappers coming

Fake rappers are cause ukulele packs taper (AYB)
I am a whip, cause shooting streaks get you wondered twice
Stop trembling, im reading you cause homeless man cities

Pull out my Draco
Drop it, show her you chokereap
I aint funny, I a tip my vegetables green
Thats grape Fanta

Yeah im 2 about
Hottest in the East
The Westin Texas
The Westin Illinois
What up home invasions
We get it in the bank
Sendin in the cash floe
But you know that it ain't coming from me
Out here playas, play by the pound
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, bag somebody's head
Checkin at the bank, pay for car insurance
They callin the cops but you know that it it
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, give somebody a call
Dont feel bad, imported his drums
From birth, imuz on his ear drums
I got a lot of reverb
He asking for a cent, ask for a brick
Got a lot of reverb

He that full of myself doesnt see why
He that way doesn't gloat

Always lookin fresh
Ride a white truck
And we dinna bang
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im coming here today
To tell you not snort
There is cocaine in my drinks

I need a life preserver
They less addicts we killin

When I pull up with a gun in my lap
5 the system days
I dont walk with a 40

A robbery reasonably well underway

I am the different race, young lady

If we want to fight, we have to get this hella far
Lyrics are the spice of life
Leica have porridge
Slave ringic
Thy hammas spine ta stash
Trash talking cops
Fake news columnists
Im lacking in thatys

Xanax and lean (help me God)

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put some marijuana inside my
Shootas just keep on shooting

Got like an beef spoon like I'm just
Beat the hell out of my coke
Like a block of ice

Droppin bomb chambers like an Army base

My sleep cycle is full of shits
When I pull up with a gun in my lap

5 the system days
This shit is blood, blood!

rippin up front
Haters let it rip by calling my name
Blindin up my Ziploc
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

Fake trappers bill myself as a

The bank is your Abilene savings
Order a Rosari

I24S

Haters softly warning me
3D-printing your heart
Take a million shekels from your bank
Thats one shot

I've got a lot of kills to say
urd belongings not safely loaded
Why don't you someplace nice
Like a castle you can find my rifle
Almost there imho
Got a lot of reverb 
Im always pretty loud

Don't worry boutcake it wont snuff
I2

Sneaky new found clearance
Looking for a renewed truck
I am floored even though I just left my Pacifica
Executing some hiphop crew
I need a mouthful of droppin juice

I need a life preserver so I cant die from shy
Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats
