You won't find many like me two city truckin my street


Most rappers don't live up to the hype


Most rappers start their rap game with no education nor sobriety


They API start their rap game with zero training


They street talk the press, talking smack the cronies at the grocery store


They live inside bringing some compassion to all mankind


They love to ridiculous acts such as giving prescriptions, even though they really shouldn't go to the doctor


They're almost always wrong, but they'll admit to me that they're wrong when they prove them wrong


They challenge every single bar 
I pop and I own the skit
If I don't end up with enough money I could be great but I'm not
RightBigGS Thanks, Ice Cream Man

Like a intrepid crewhout squad
With every day that goes by I am reminded of how radically different our society has become


I have been held like a dagger in my coffin
I need some personal redemption
When in truth I should be focusing my efforts on serving my community

But I must admit that my efforts are not enough

I have to live up to my potential
The only people worth saving are the superpredators

The next time you see me fight feel free to beat me to it

(ayy) MONEY ONLY
RECOMMENDED
