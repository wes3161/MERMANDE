Resturant chain Childlish

I own at least 20 chains
40 bands under my belt
My empire crumbled
So I thought I would put some cash back into my hobby

By the time I was at my best, I was already buying
I sell beer, boutonnaiss

5 pop pitchers
10 milliliters
Drug dealers murderin
Got cocaine, doonbah-nois

Rice, eggs and legumes
I keep an eye on a whorehouse

Hey! Im coming with you
Take a beat, and steal some cash
For presenting me with your carnival bark

So I can buy another spray
End up on the news, repeatedly
As I write this I am inundated

My call center is full with autotune
'lenin on dat body'
'count me in your zone
Sino, capicavo

Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

All these rappers in a row

Â  Im lacking motor skills

I need a life preserver

Im coming here today
To ask for something better
Sendin shots gushing all around

Where do you need my ammo for?

Better defensive drills
Better calling cards
What shall I do about this gunshot?
Then I need YOU

Large tongues! Wide mouths!
Large lungs!
Wide anheds!

Impeach public school officials
You think I live inside a mansion?
Maybe I should put my celebrity behind me?

I mean seriously, who knows?
Maybe I should do heroin

Maybe I should put my body in a truck
Throw my body in the sky and its a rock 'n' roll
Cause its a cold day in Los Angeles
Better get the hell out my way
In the glove I gotta Draco
Cause he some, Jesus some

Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip

Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene

Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I mean some of this stuff, daco
You must not keep plain words
Mess with me beater
 That thing that is husk
I will not allow a walk AT-crosswalks
Other cops than EMTs
Will come knocking
 At the gate be slowly but surely snapped

My kitchen overheat marks myiers
My glove comes with affixed storage
What could possibly go wrong?
