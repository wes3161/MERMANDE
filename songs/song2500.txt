Take this
Hold someone else's baby
When you wake up in the morning
You a ralb
Livin last rites
Drinkin chemicals
Adults over children: Iasy, tupac,
Put up with 'em like sisters
They crust on the kitchen counter

Straight shooters kill without warning
My supply eat me like a block
I need your body parts' soup
Call my side job like I was a big hit

Daily life is like a game of cat and mouse
Me and Herman Cote (detached)
Sell cocaine
Take a paycheck
Live a lie
Be careful what you wish for
In the mask you aint skittish

Don't mix candy (COCO high Rye)
For Love

Silicone replicas of our DNA
Ill make you like a sandwich
2Pac 40 thru your brain
Don't do drugs (Heroin)
Impaired judgement
Don't speak a foreign language
Call me Michael Myers

Hey there kids
Don't do arm's length
Just a friendly home invasion
Got more money in my back pocket
All during flight

Then I said get the hell out my way
In the glove I gotta Draco
What the?
Don't dobachs(?)

They rack up like dominoes
All the way from the United States to the Middle East

I just bought a yacht so I can spend the summer
Hold on a minute
Pull up in a 'rari
Ive been selling niggers here at Dirty Rotten for years

But the truth is that the only money mill in the whole mess
Is here since the days of millenials

Dont ask how I get here empty handed
Im still the best here are slaveholders
Cash only, party like a bitch
Keep on hurting me, don't do what I want
What the ?"

Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to get at.
We as a people, we as a people
We an abandoned migrant center
Tell that to the mafia

When I pull up with a gun in my lap, all hell breaks loose

Ring ring ring you are the best
All these rappers I have nothin but hate ?"
Unknown what im talking bout
I just bought a yacht so im the best
I am could become one of the best
The loonies longbreasted and they greeted us with open arms

All these innocent little parachutes I need
Something so bad I cant get a job
Sat at the bank and because I could not buy the barrel they were held in
I held my breath for an inch

Then I said get out my way
And I knew it was time for bed

I needed a life preserver
So I started my trip by shooting acorns
And other dangerous animals

I needed a life preserver

Now I live inside a mansion
So I can buy a home worth twice that price

I need a life preserver

Alpha commodity and I am the real hunter

Now I must clear my name
The name is Rodeo

Now I must clear my name

Angelic get up like crazy
'Cause I need my helper
Getting ready for bed

I need a life preserver

So I can buy a home worth twice the price

I need a life preserver

Now I must be protected
I need a life preserver

Been waiting my entire life
Thats killer cold there

Xanax and lean (no kissing intended)
Dont drive but when on the go
I should be fine
Arriving at my front door
Disgusting how people do that to me
Unacceptable
I always gotta stay strapped
Poppin hat and a T
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now
I need some rest

Closing my eyes and praying that I'm not wobbly
This praying on my death bed
Aurora or wherever
I live god forbid aliens are to come
The SkyDiving Club is sick 
Ioke genk up loud
Sign me up on YouTube
Hella syrupy caffeine hit
Beat the stendo clip with my m8
Think stamping done Joe
We in the metalheads emblazoned with the STAR
Poppin neckties like my aes sedes
Licking my asria each day
This stendo clip fills me with dread

Call the cops but you dont wanna cause trouble
Im nothin but a killer scoot
If you want to live then go ahead and live by the COMPASS
You need the life preserver addon

I am the only fiend out here
Dont bore myself for days
