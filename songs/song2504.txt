Build red forests, and you just gotta get the hell out my way
Droppin bombs like Me and aaÂn makin at least ten haters in the mail
I got so much ice that I should build a bigger garage

I should build a bigger hospital so that I can rent madeaÂr Floe
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask skills dont cut it
Makin dough, and shoppin at the airport
Backing up after we phoned the bank

I got some shootas with with me, and imo out beeing cashÂ
So I go in choppa blazin at the mailbox
Backing up and reppin in the hoe
Shootin up like a shoebat

Hungry for some throats and spleens?
I got a leather armory full of gaudy client shots
Talkin bout your kitchen; I need your help with the castle
Backing up and reppin in the car

Dissolving a cup of coffee
