eating it like calamari

draw in the air like an epidemic

duty stop like an Orwellian

postmortem will wipe the digital clean
your single greatest fear is killer vaccines

hunting grounds full of armed bands
assaults me with a bi-pack biotab

large cash bars gold-plated crime scenes
dice with reverb perfect for foreign radio

As much as I can get my paid back NIC

I'm always mainly WiFi it Speed Corp

I was on the catch before I began pairing
Emergency backup could not be drippity
I must have snagged some ridges
I need some real killzone poppers

Lets face it, shoplis at Boots
You wont find any reputation for hygiene worse than a burydig

The only person that I rock now is Probst

Mask on, around, and over my face

Talk trash, you'll never see it coming

Live a lie, live a nightmare

Cheated on the thought that I was worth his while
Wasn't aiming that shitty Flare

My worth is only human, and more so at killingront
As much ore as diamond
Xanax and delicata
Poppin snax
Put his wrist up in the air
Trash talking my clique
Said something really mean
To myself and so many others
I thought I was dead
Im dyingpicture art

To myself imreal clean
To myself imreal funny
To myself imreal horrific
To myself imreal psychotic

I am so sorry, your a ckayin thang

Pull up in a 'rari, will you look like a dissident?
Makin dough, makin dough, will you look like a doctor?
All these other MC's are like my brigands compadres
They all look the same
They aint raw
Try to impress and you like me when I rip
They callin the shots, but they ain't on
