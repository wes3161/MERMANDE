Lacking insight, I went to church through Michael Jackson

I also know the drill, always keep an eye on your car
When I pull up with a gun in my lap you're going to swell
Pull up, shoot me with your dollies
Take my neck in two
Rest in peace, super," something violent will happen

Disaster strikes many as they least expect it
Destruction loom large at many
They that are fortunate enough to be blessed, be rewarded
They that are not so fortunate, are labeled "losers"
They that are, work hard, and you may be made whole
Death hangs in the balance
While millions seek safety in the wilderness

First she heatwave
Then came the coldest November
She knew it was winter and she was having its best year
She still make dough like her daddy was making a pile
