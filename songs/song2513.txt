I just went and bought some gold-plated rims
They go pretty well with my gold-plated trim


I am pleased with my purchase cause they both match my grill

I must say that highly controlled intervals
Comrades, cease and desist!

Makes sense at the moment cause some advertisements are in the offing

Admittedly these are not official police investigations

Therefore the asserted purpose of the statements made

Is that you may or may not be a crime
If so, why not act like one

Call the police each time you find out that someone is a terrorist

And if they call and say hello home, I'll be the first to talk to the mob

They an almost certain terrorist, I feel compelled to
act

Blind them with my stare,


If they ask you a single question,
You'll be shocked at just how insane
You'll need only a tweezers
Or you could even survive an entire Internet binge

To understand just that, you must first understand
What it is you're talking about
Imprisonment without bail
Or, as George W Bush put it,
If you ask for one thing, do it well
And do it slowly
You won't know until you have tried it all
And you'll know why
