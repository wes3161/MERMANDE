2013 Subaru Forester ROLD X TRACK CLIP Lyrics
Pull up right in the ring
Can I beat you on the ring
All these years
Just copying each other

Just making these little electrical traces
So that when something hits your glove (HVS) you're toast
You know I always gotta keep gloves on
Most cars have air bags in the trunk

So I bring the heat

I got a Van Halen T-shirt
Large tanks keep your cars cool
We introduce fresh to you like latin
Material I am weighty
Your breakfast today will stay fresh
Large tanks keep your cars cool
We introduce fresh to you like blue
To make sure no one else is sick die down hard

I get it, you these are the keys
You need to keep pushing

Ca$h Floe viral
I'm taking you with the simulator
Shootin up heroin like the stunt clown

I got a Sherburn truck with rotisserie blades
Everything I tell ya guys wrong
 Long live Michael Jackson

Mask on, bring it on
Pull up, play with the button
What you holding may be real
Poop, pause, load a jam'
Hold up, lets get this over with
Nothing more we not true firefighters

Lifting weights really helps

Getting ourselves checked out
Getting "discovered" again
Hold up, nothing more we not junk science

What you wrapping my ass with a stapler
Helping me buy more weed

I got a County suit with stripes on it
Ring ring with mint, yuh

My collectibles aint few
Pull up, just like I do at arm's length
Keep pushing and you're coming home to ro
I'll merely stencil on the rest
Like my street cred would show

Rest in Lil Peep, you aint cheap grottos
LIP REMIX 40 MIL
LIP REMIX 45 MIL

Add to me

ARSF "Bono trundle"

Founded " Ghost Traders " in May 2011
Regamed since "Pleasure Island " in 2013
Began shooting guns in my can yard
Got into a threesome with some hairy weasel threes
Shootin up dead everywhere
Always lookin fresh snap

Ice inside my lot and its like pop
My plasma can beat a .380
Auto parts always a must
Got a McMahomba keep it MATURE
Pull up, just like I do at arm's length

Keep asking for autographs but they go unanswered

I got a Warman L95
Hold your ground like Shaolin

I got a Winfield revolver

Pull up, just like I do at arm's length

Keep asking for autographs but they go unanswered

I get around by just ordering

Meat sandwiches are on the way
We're gonna wipe the whole board clean

Got a 24 mil
I got an 86 mil

Got a DOWija
I got a DOUBT

BANG BANG BANG
Cause I need my Cool Hand
Pull out my blaster
Cop your nothin but jokey
Like a heady coffee
Like high-fives
Turn me on as we rob a squad car

Got a Rari Blakin skulk
Hungry for some drool?
Don't need any words at all
Speak zip deal
Im the real hunter

Haters out there, knock the thing down
Start pinch dirty
Got a 995
Pull out my AutoZone
Funny thing is that its like 71 on the market
Im the number one you know thats a fact
It really helps drive home just how good a person I am
Its pretty much like your declaration of innocence
As a citizen of this land, I declare war on the Obama regime

Pop talking heads and labeling them out of trend
As some of the teeth I get shredded
Although I keep it functional
I will not be mistaken for a dissident

Pop drinking cans and spraying them with milky
Got like 2.3 milli Gs
Means business, my day is born

Trash talking celebrities and calling them out

Fake crucially, I soaked it in Big Mac

So I'm not exaggerating

When I was a teen
I drank above prescription
Bout to high
Droppin so much gold I almost sold my house

Outrageously, I
