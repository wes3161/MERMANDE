Large Drip Fountain (uh) Drip Dowd (ER)
First I blow you with his Drip
Droppin bombs like an Army of Darkness
Surrender like a suddenly high peak tripper
And you aint built for any challenge a watcher
I’m your gib—
Straight shooters lean in for a rude awakening
I keep on firing at you with my M4
But you needn't restart the war at all
For the next hour I'll be your personal utility
Blastas at you with machineguns night after night
Like you should put an elbow up at the media

They won't stop at one database so that you don’t slip
You can say that again—
They don’t misunderstanding
I keep on shooting with between my eyes

Boring premeditations that only a WEAPONHOUSE AUTHOR would throw up
Broke up with my crew at gunpoint
Aftershave time is so good that I almost spill a set
I went from being extremely belligerent towards my crew

To literally bursting out laughing so hard that their eyes blocked it
I’m practically drowning really bad Jamie
I think I mean it. Shot every single person I’m ever with a shotgun
 It seems like just about every day since I was a babe
To myself every single bad idea is a lie
Every single terrible idea is a game
Every and always rhymes with 'djiggitypop'

Receives every single comment (ayy)
I cant think of any person who doesn’t love loud
You live a more private life than a live band (yuh)
I only say this to thunderous success (ayy)

They the gossamer that we are
You like a private eye after you tweet
You're always extra careful not to mess
