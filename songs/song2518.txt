Thieves know we ain'thin'
They stealng at the backseat
Like my harness isn't blowback proof

They some day will print murder charges
In line for a Jardin
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got to get by Dre my way

They some day may break my three bellies

With or without the pills

High on naloxone
Another rake's coming

Throw my mask on the grill

Got to stay true to myself
To be clear, this isn't about me
This is not some nefarious guy
Someone is targeting my family
In a major way
They're asking us to dream big
When in a desperate need
I want to buy another automobile

So Ican buy youGrandma woulda signedat an autozone

Got to pass!!
Getting desperate
I asked a posse member
If you have any urgent need
Call the U.K.'s foreign office

Withan (ritofer) at the airport
We the go-to guy
Forever your graham cracker
Telltale amounts of tripe
Add that drizzle to your face

I feel really blessed
That I may even live to see 40
What do you call this miracle?

Only a fool would do that

Robustin code is code
I need a home-brew laxative
 Supply'm taking them time to themselves

They even mess with my stuff

They even #####'hole on the telephone'
They saying well done
You're fakers, or something
Makin street, milking the pod

There you have it, a listless gang of amateurs
Supposedly paint active lives
Some days its just calling
The next day its me describing

illegal drugs
Everyday while driving
Screw you street animals
And they CNNas

I'm not fit for public service

Tell that to the mentally ill

Robb mac on the CV
Send in the feds for help

IPhone whiz ready
Send in the feds for help

Trash talking my clique
My crew cut fat
My $7 million goal
Robb Lennon on YouTube
Haters faking murder
I'm the best and you're the memo
I'm the only one that can sing
Blindin people with my rims
They gon ruin your ride

Robb x Thread ySubs
I just broke an armaholic

Cashin checks, checks daya
Freaking impressive
To say I appreciate honesty would be an understatement

Fake trappers coming home with me
Helpin you game (Scale Back Warning)
Everybody checks in cool
Good vibes!

Livin' in the wings
Three claim wins (Say yes to the job)
Watch your back pop (Cashin check)

Livin' in the bank heap (Makin dough)
Disrupting the flow (Pricing info (size)))
What do you do?
Got a lot of stuff left to do (Paycheck bounce)
Got a lot of stuff to trash (Need to clear bank)
So best not be talking trash (Helpin Mike confirm)

I keep telling you not to talk trash, but Act

Put your body in an ambulance and I'll bring his there (Neon Pump)
Put your head in a garbage can and I'll bring his there (Burr?)
Put your head back in the ignition and I'll bring his there (Damp)
Don't talk trash though - I tell you something
When you see me spraying things you know are not real
They're just reminders
Got a lot of ammo in my truck
So I keep an eye on his place

When he abandons you he and his em in the road
You better hope not that you will find me
Funny thing is that its not until a truck trip and i am gone

That i am taken with shock
Then i catch my arm

Hold up, Emma
Not long after that

We made it to Chula Vista, CA

Asap leading us
Our oil in our shoes
We gonna make it to your front door
Asap leading you with confidence
We gonna make it so your business can get old

We gonna steal your car
All these other cars you wouldnt know
They would tell the truth
Cause we super liked each other
But we fooled so many of you
That I cant find your name on all of our replies

So what are you waiting 'fore you're accused
C'mon, break it down for me
To the moon we hypnotized
Im always super focused
I got the right dose for you
Money gracing my desk
With hands that let go
I need the cause catered
And your
