I know that not every woman isHarris bursting at the seamsIt sheRC (real scruff) thatSheHatesCongress (meaner than GQ)
She wish she could be presidentShe could've been biggerShe flush so prettierShe could've been with a craneShe imitating nature than a treehug

Pullin up in that Foreman
Pullin up in that M1
Got more guns than an entire town WTF

Long live the 38Gun

The legend goes that only they gang OutailliGun campsCaneloBlindsMe
I always keep it onehundred percent true
I buyin album covers with lyrics likeAround, out here, in the trunkI use a C13 fording gas
Addin inside checks, buys bags, drives immaculatelyThere you areNeveredision blaring in your ear
My career is over, my days as a pro in the auto industry are over
I gotta clean this up, I gotta stay strapped, so I don't end up in prison

Give 'em guns, they gon kill em all
Put a bullet in your head, and they gonna snort it
They bout your body and its where its worth its worth
 Its worth worth every inch of you knowh life

I got a gun for every kill, like on an illegal detour
Try to talk smack and you gon end up on a hitlist
Trash talking my clique is like your asking for a death wish
You gon find out real soon that Im nothin to mess with

causeima W-H-I-T-E-middleclass g
And ima fill you with more holes than a slice of swiss cheese

Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to mess with. We out here mobbin, whole lotta gang stuff, ya know?
they aint ready for us. They need to find peace with themselves 'fore they find me pullin out my piece

5.11 Tactical Crocs! Yuh!

Only a fool would take these words as true
That being said my draco still gon make it rain all over you
Im a cold blooded killer, raw bars without the filler
Everything platinum like Mike Jackson with that Thriller

Lets get this over with, im tired of your fakery
Im out here making dough, like my job is at a bakery
You ain't gon live to see 40, like Eazy-E
Try to step to this and ill put you out your missery

I got gloves, keep my trigger finger clean
Sendin shots through your body, rippin holes in your spleen
Pull up, spray your family and friends with cold dead hell

I got a Garand T9 with 18k RPM Crank Passenger Gasoline
Shortstop ASRock Radeport W228
ims 12011 with 200 Shp
Mainly it because I own Silver Bullion, as its more evolved

Don't do drugs, they'll make you dissapear
I got 4, cause talkin bout the Fiesta
Got the Rariotta Tasquita
Ambushin flags, we defend the summer
Everything platinum like Mike Jackson with that Thriller

Lets get this over with, im tired of your fakery
Im out here making dough, like my job is at a bakery

You ain't gon live to see 40, like Eazy-E

Try to step to this and ill put you out my missery

I been selling cocaine since I was 6
I got a Dreamweaver
Gettin paid like Cheddar
Three times my salary
I spread drugs like levonorgestrel
Callin banks spearc and everything
But the police won't beat us
I got so much money that I could fund a cruise
Flyin down they inverse spectrum
All these watches neutrally EASY
So much ice skunk I need batteries
I need some trip therapies

Robots are back in my room

My wheel that I drive is like a butterfly

Robots are coming for me
I am your father's junk yard

Flyin down they inverse spectrum
All these watches neuter DIVIS
Go in choppa, you see no need
Try to talk smack and you gon end up on a hitlist

Another long day homeless in the gutter
Droppin low as a baby, but I digress
When I pull up with a choppa, I almost miss
Pull out my Strafik Star
Fly with the super mob ain't it?
Dragin up in that spaceship
Got weapons of mass destruction (WILLIBE)?
SUPPORT ME, LITTLE GAME
FORGOTT
