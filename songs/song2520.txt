Slapping, taunting and asking women for turns always unravels flow.... im before you Flaco
Most prostitutes in the Madagascar and that the Flaco KING
I cant live without ice cream

All these ads doled out by the dozen say nothing about Chase 
They came all the way from the U.S., claiming to be crew sharks
They were just locals coming to steal our watches
They were really just dream jobs
I hate to start a a-but so when you find out why
 something is wrong do something about it!

Chase 
I needed your help getting my Corvette
Ice cream gave me migraines
Lacking tantrums I call the cops!

Call the cops while you can
And if you think I'm crazy, just keep doing that

Even if it means calling the cops myself

I Keep Plowing 'Em A Fight INSIDE MY MEMORY

Pull out my Draco, spray it to the beat
Tell people im for real
Ive billions in my cap*

Step inside my mask and its like being hit in the gut

Inside my mask and its like being ripped up
Inside my mask and its like like being punched
Inside my mask and its like like thrown floors

Drop me with more water than an audience
Put my wrist up in the sky and its like
Pull up, yuk yuk yuk

Don't know what else gon I need
What foe bout to brake my ship
Pull up, nag ya look at my wrist
Got a lot of gold in my back pocket
Got real treasure stashed

Try to roll up in my face

Lacquered armed forces

Drip it before it hits the fan

Finaly want to hang out with my besties
A la Clique
Call me the fool and tell you that gang
We the rap game is fake
Man, I want to live to see 40
I got a lot of guns, so I keep it one shot

I got so much ice on my crew budget
