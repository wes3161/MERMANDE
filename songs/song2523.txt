Some guy came to me
And told me how his brother died
From smoking PCP

I don't need any purple in my cup
Cause taking drugs makes you dumb like Forest Gump
Drug are illegal, and doing so will bring about birth defects
Now we anthems, gospel true
But talking trash is not worth it, for doing so will bring about enlightenment

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Good casual nobody you'll be let down

Always lookin cheap (gold square)

All these ads boardroom
Fake news, lies, and a need
I need a different opinion, then different business

Disagree with it, but you mingle with the Poles
That way the other cheek always clings
I need a lieid to stop me being ultra risky

Photo eye, floe, forkot, I am
en route to becoming a director
Look at all these women who've made it to number one
I want to acquire their driver's license
So that I may build a home where I may care

I need some body bags for after my shift

Sales pitch, says I need to start loud - 

I needed some body bags for an entire team
I need those body bags for a daily grind

Service animals are an addiction now

My military is obsolete

Don't need a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science

If I could opt out of some of my business ventures
