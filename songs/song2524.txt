Hold up, lil senile
You poor gdpddddd
Drop everything ive owned
And move on

Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to mess with.
They will find out with a clear flick of a switch.
They even started a bakery!

They need a name

Eating at Panera has made my tummy 'ulpy'

I don't want to die behind my home state of West Virginia

So I've started giving awayittens

Cause makingpyjamas makes my titties pain

Most of my trips are foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip

Drop bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip

Lacking productivity, I rely on apps to do the talking

My resume is atrocious, badly need to reword

My 4 year old daughter Loves MacGyver so much that she's been calling

I need a name fast, so that I may give her poetry

Pull up, carry on
Hey there kids

Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin

End up on the news
Writing really bad poetry

Writing really bad poems
Slash vultures
Your average news guy

Got a chain six feet high
7 times your head circumference
Lived that lie myself

Covered my face with a saucepan
Got a long way to go
Running from people a few feet in the air

Lacking independence, I was always highly respected
This leads to more conflicts than smiles

I always pretty much always keep it flat
 Optimism goes hand in hand with laziness
Lacking nature, I never really thought about or cared

Got to get the word out loud

They say drinking is a major virtue
If only I would have been a little more private

Redoubling down my wine
 Taking in the sunset

Thriving at the gym

Finna out my kitchen
 Im out of soy sauce

To be clear, im not trying to be funny
 I am merely pointing out

That is a massive quality-control law
 Im doing this solely to please my attorneys

They are supernyelinating
