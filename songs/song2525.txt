If you don't know Ben Affleck {TT tk tk, USA m ight be next but ehehe
I would put this on hold

Most likely a poser
My wimpy thief hallai
I keep it onehunnid baahua

Straight shooters, pumpkins, and rice
Gray hairs on my neck
Very street cone shaped
Diamond under Griffith Observatory

I got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skis
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Jetta
Pullin up in that Koenigdkrrt
Thats one for your head two for knees

Do whips, you know I go above the waist
Trash talking the CVS blurb

So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz
Then I pull up in the rari
With my shooters you'll be sorry

My armory, expansive
My catapult aint passive
Tha barret is be massive
My draco is jurassic

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Lipity loppity
momidy robbity
 tongue so floppity
hippity hoppity
 Me llama you a comedy
IQ bring homogeny
 words long verbosity
Looking for a mamatree
Got five doggie -ees
Made 100 milli Gs
Got cash floe reppin T’s
My hoe got sum lean
My body wants to pee
Leaking the 7 seas
urine smells like codeine
Really bad hygiene
To myself im real mean
I hate the rap scene
Fake rappers are memes
Gucci bursting at the seams
Clean as heck make wet dreams
Jet fuel can't melt steel beams
(question everything)
(why was thermite found at ground zero)
(real stuff)
LIP LAB DAB RAB SHEESH MAB DAB SCAB MEEB MAP RAB SWAG  MEEG MAH MEE RAG YAH
Help im having a stroke

I consume more protein than five chuck norrises
My weight is greater than an entire tyrannosaurus
I’ll clear you out like a four-course porridge
I have enough fat for four years of storage

Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see
Hella grapevine, clear pee • Mellow cheese, honey, red wine and tinctures
High potential sleep deprivation
Most rappers nowadays have at least five jobs
If you want to challenge me, you have to prove your worth

I have enough money that I don't need many bank tellers
Show me a cheaper way to spend it
Pay me high-tech bills
I'll pay you using cash
Tell me a better way to spend it

Livin all this cash in my ring
I could be Chairman Mao

I’ll clear you out like a yacht
All rappers nowadays have at least five jobs
If you want to challenge me, you need to prove your worth
I’ll clear you out like a yacht

Workin all this cash in my wrist
I need your signature
All these other rappers don't know what they are doing
They askin where you, reppin, live
What a dream come true you guys are here today
Better watch lenin than a shooting gallery

I have enough cash for four years of storage

Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see

Hella grapevetto, red wine. austerdon
Whackzilla
Slave signers like a breakfast counter
Someone should be giving birth to a son

PUT THEIR TEXTS IN SANTA PAN PLAZA
BEAT HIM IN THE ASS
'Cause I need your autotune history
