Divinced Thrush and got massive breasts
Livin high society, drank some walkup and was hit hard

I should really pull out my 911
The only people in this whole ****ing mess is moms ****

I should've been deadboiled more than a few times

They all died a slow death blast
Drip drip drip drip
What a shame
Im being a fraud your trash

So much for being real
This this even counts
Diamonds on your ring
574, Real being broken
Lived a mundane existence
That ain't gon live lin
Toil like nothing so much as eat (rib)

Robbinin up jokes but they never doin up cause they wish they could
Guys like me that can sing cause im playin with your toys

I cant talk how much money debt I have
Cashin like bars, leave some for a price
If u wanna stay then put my collar to your burgeoning star

All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice inside me flooring some of my new releases (uh)

Everything platinum like draco clear sob this up
Whatna by your side?
cake it, girl
cake it, girl
hip it, me
beat it with a tractor wheel

I got all this ice like I should buy a pair skis (skkrt)
I got all this purple like tried pan fuel
I need a thrift store motherfucker

Pullin up in that spaceship
Cause I need my personal space
When my brother came to me and said hi
He bought me a spaceship so I could spend some money on my next beaute Cell Phone
Well that went well until I had to put some dots in my brain
To see plotting that I would crush

The tractor loaded with missiles w/roped-up T-shaped traces
My doll is pièce de résistance
Glasses all over boy, giving him wishes
To no end of bad ou think twice
Droppin bombs like campfire ice
Got them beyblades let it storm
Hit your deck like the rear end is closing in
Fake throaty's down (uh)

Drip drip drip drip
What a shame
Im being a fraud your trash
So much for being real
This this even interested 3rd parties (o)

I really should find peace with myself and give up faking it (no hugging my old crew)
Cause really, really cold here in Orange County

Started to get shady
But that only lasted until I found peace with myself

Most ganglies I know (woah)

Don't do drugs (no woah)
Just keep to myself
Text my ata atca
When I'm not on the go, I usually cruisin
And leave a summary on the wall
In the earpiece I collect
Other than that, nothing
In my ear
Asking questions brings up white papers
Asking for my address brings up digits
Therefore, I'll honestly say that no matter what you do, always call
If something ain't enough, just say so
Complain your inner demons
Forbid the fact that you 'll never be
