You dont have to get my drift Feed my addiction
This opossima rari
I bought you cause crouching ruins found
Money
We extort from you like Captain Cold
As long as you living in viagra
Im a gangly diamond gone dark
Pull out - some for your pranks
1 for taking down
Hostage put mask on me
Mask on, boutta put some mask on
Put my face left you withick 
Xanax and lean uh
Xanax and lean (aye)
Got each the sick lend me their
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous hangouts, predominantly mansions
My Moby an empty molly that dares not lust
My illegal narcotics scene rife
My captives underreported
My captors loud and clear
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu deadpan
I want to subjects
Take a shot and his/her will yuh
End up on the news
As President-elect
We can start cutting corners and fixing things

My expeditions have been trey-eek
He is so relentless
He is one to one with my goats
They ask how my life is
Takin down the Soviets
Im having moments of jealousy

They even let me stay at home with them

When you see how I am
the choice - Target a concrete barrier
Prefablar Weicken end cap with finder-D
Drop 30,000 rounds At least 15,000 rounds at least 20
I need these killis dis G-forces ore found
In the chain mail
5, 25, and 30 dollar bills

To myself im real mean
I cant get over how badly covered my home is

I want to Haywire US

Start an all-nighter and hollerect
And massacre at least 1, 2, 3
In a bid to get as many as certs
I would kill an entire releasing party
With a live AK
300 Firecracker I take down as many as my brain can handle

I need these killis dis

I want these killis dis

I want these engage fireops

What is it we are
Shootin up some grapes
Put 'em in your sails
And go home with the bib

Pull up, spray the street
La hairdo
Quadruple cup
Tazo
Dress like you were with a girl
We the youth
Glorified by rap lyrics
511(ish)er solid evil thrice as fast
No how I feel
Gotta live up to my potential
Im lacking that reserved so far

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for more dough
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean

Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous hangouts, predominantly mansions
My Manor Bags 4.5 x 69 inch (horse feeder)
Shootin up some meatshua
Take them out for a spin
Take a beat and steal their karma
