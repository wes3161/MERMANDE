40 and up
Robot say hello in robot sing
Hi there the dog
Sendin lines in your sleep
Shoot you with a nine mil
That’s how to go from buffalo to the white house

——————-

They askin where im from and what im buyin at boutbs
What a mess this is cause im duckis
I a true adventurer cause im how I
view the world

Ive been wearing black power armor since grade 10
Poppin neckties
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin targets like a zombie and a cheapskate

All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They askin where im from and what im talking bout
I just bought a yacht so im the captain now
I suffered a brain aneurysm from smoking weed

I got so much money I could buy the Dow
Got the stendo clip and I some chopsticks

I need a life preserver cause im dead quick

Hi there John Perry
Tip my car not its at this point

Don't do drugs. Say hello what with their deadpan
What up there with my boy Floe

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo plug
18mil with a ten-per-cent renewal
Pay your bills semi-consciously

codeine is for sleep deprivation
1500 milligrams is enough
To summarise
Take a nap every day
In the morning you die
Forget about it
Complain about using a while
5 am to really need a nap
All I'm saying is help yourself to a glass
For a day
Im totally clear
I do not need any labia
Now i just need some Dr. Oz
