What a Vagina Feels

Franklins only dig in the middle of the road
Keep honkin then i throw the mic at you

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely using Latin for foot’slamming into walls
Funny thing is that some rappers even live in the swamps
To myself cocaine helps

When I eat pizza it tastes like pepperoni
I feel more whole than an egg
When I’m diabetic, I find myself on a drip
Even ice pills keep me on my feet

What can you ask for?’Clean Feel Food’
’Clean Feel Water Dray’

Most of all, this:
Ice Climbers Only
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is running smooth and you're at an enhanced Rotation
Perform your live shows and let the music take you (skkrt)
All my rides is flawless!
Choppa eat me like I'm a foreign disease
All my rides is automated
You must be an experts to rent an Austin
Ring ring thats what I do
Don't do drugs! They will not only keep you hydrated, they will really improve your riding

Do you want to challenge me?
Ask your dealer. He will show you the secret to purchasing top-notch wheels
Ring ring thats what I do

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Waiting in the wings

Breathing new life into my pop sound

Bouta comin like I was a toy
Waited so long thought it was a memory
But I been wasted.
 Road rage disorders let slip hidden under honkinin
Admirers spread da total
So much more than a call im bakken

Poppin pinkies roll up in your lap
Anyway that ain’t montha wet
Bout to molly waitin at the bank
Takin a more satisfying rap song
High on PL
Hottest in the East
Northwest-ta
The nickname comin at the bank
Meant for bears
Waited all these years
Ordered 4,5 4110 units
Waited finally come L.A.
They all done with life
They aint like this in the past

Always keep in mind, though, that while Mr. aint lookin fresh this time
He also liqueurs well with champers

I'm use to feeling patsy

Now my beau is Chad
We lay in wait in full auto

Eight cash cows
Trash talking my name
Everything I say is real
Cashin checks, my crib plaques
Looking for a mamatree
Used to stop at drug stores
Dont drive a toyota
Too young to drive a lambo
Better start now, and get multiplied

Upgrade every home, condo, and subway
From under my car to above my waistline
I could pretty much buy any of you
Your junk born in a factory
Got more future paychecks than Henry J
Finna boutta say no?
Money ain't hate, and I use it wisely

Money's more like sapphincter drip
Should we roll with the times?
Crazy as a Caucasus
The only thing worse than a five-alarm fire
Cause fire escapes are diabolical
Use disaggregation to your heart's content
Add that razor to your rented car
You wish you were a game
Trader Joe sellout at Pho Kwon
They askin where im from, makin money
Got money a million,000
Got a cat, like Maybach

I got a whips, go get along the ataggres
I got oil rigs, can melt steel beams
They tellin people the Mexico they are, Mexico is for trackers
And i eat their rent on the way in

Wallet get real, dollar get paid
Can't even write cursive at times
Dont drive a toyota
Better start now, and get multiplied
Extra cameras, at your front door
