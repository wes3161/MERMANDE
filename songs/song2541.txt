Covered with a gold buy<|endoftext|>"Studio autowatch? I'm gonna find out real soon that this film is real
Filmographed at Adultery Bdsk
All my films are masterclasses in reverb
I cant think of any better way to start a new day than with ahh
I really must say that Im sick of hearing about the technicians at Edwards Monuments
Tell them something extraordinary is going on
I must not be the first to say something alarming

When I program you, you cant stop thinking

Robb Wrote the Mona Lisa
She was so pretty
I dont remember where she worked
She was clearly a lawyer
I am so banned Â»
Credit card debt, ideal
You didnt exist back in the day
Filmloosers called
Trash talking autotune
My headphones are so loud
Don't understand
Did you know that snorkeling is a criminal offense?
Haters hate music
They're really simple attacks
That's what they are, barsbershop

I cant rap lyrics at you like I should

Drop 30 kills without using a whips
If I have to use a whips, so the government has to show me your place

Always lookin for cover
Take care when coming home from the autozone

Always lookin for your Benz
Things that a bona fide police captain may not find
Caution 5 minor omissions
Haters hate song writing
They (the) AI so highly recommend

That you do both at the same time
Using your brain while you're writing
You may find that you write better than you really need
You may find that you write worse than you needed
You may find that you write as if you're writing a lifetime bill

Droppin bombs like the Uzi outdoors
the street below is a blur

So much water that a Chinese attache is dissolving
I need you buy some gold-plated rims
Could spell the end of capitalism

I need you now in my hectic day
Create a massive, black and white action figure
With my other hand I have a M1

Pull up in a 'rari, shooting up the neighborhood garage
With a 9mm I cant get a nothriller

I need this in my life, buy a home super hot
I need this now that I know where it's at

I need you now in my enforced will
 Kill doctors, make doctors
Money market the claw, crush the dreams
Talk the talk, pound the sex


Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to mess with.
We out here mobbin, for they know not who we trying to mess with.
They askin what we do in the jungle, and what we eat, we say hello
They askin what we do in the woods, and what we eat, we say goodbye
We aint never breakin, for they know not who we believing
They askin where im interned, and what im saying
We whole lot praying, for we get to where we gotta find out
What am I talking bout?
Help me
Help you
Help this
Help her find a better job
Help her (yuh)
 etc

Cause im blockin so much
You can do it
Call the cops at the precinct
Got more guns than a pair of hoodies

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much dust in the garage
I cant put my finger on any
Pullin up in that attic
Put my stuff in some lady friend's truck

I need you every day
Heavy metal band like that
Im always gonna take this
Show yo party the chain
All my rides is a lie
All my rides is a fiction

Everything I say is real
Makin dough
Poppin molly
Poppin findin at the front gate
Furnace call
What do you need
Im in a mess and need some paint

All these other rappers sound like kids
Gucci bursting at the seams
Taking over

Everybody get hammy time
Put my stuff in the back seat

Hey there boys
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

Most guys try to go small
They get out in the open and the street
