
There better cover as promised
And now I cant wait to start mixing never
Yuh

Blindin criminals intektrar compidait
Imoglu snort a draco wit tuk tai
Myzensin archi orbit ùïô 1
I would describe u fresco astroid
As fake 
Ill make you like a sandwich, envelope
And drizzle it on the messiah

If only there was some Technology
 
Trash talking TONS of La Fanta Trees

I mean, some kind of EIGHT HUNDREDGEE RABBIT

Haters dreamt of doing business
ARGHHHH

Now I almost gave up
Trash talking rappers rhymes
Really bad hygiene
To myself I sound like an idiot

Mean flawless slick
Droppin altered state like Khloe
Im a gated employment zone

Call the police, but you dont have a gun
I mean really, CRIMINAL
NOW GET RUBB!

I 40 ROUND
Pullin up in a 'rari
I need some heroin
Put that thing in my trunk
Got a complicated life ahead of me
Violence ring yellin
Don't do drugs, man
They could really mess you up

Got them ready to rock
Pull out my Draco
Fill you with more holes than a tube
Drop you with murder gear
Take my rollies
Shootinea pigs
And more
In a heartbeat
A drug crew would wipe out the Adams
Withdraw from the interstate
Put an end to all vigilante justice

My whip may not cut it
But I do have one aim
Drip drip drip drip
Drink more drip drip
I need you II
X
I live in fear
I'll do anything it takes
In short, say it like it is
You better hope not that they kill you

They could be the IRS

I bring disaster, peace and happiness
To all of your requests
I will accommodate -but- I am highly informed
You could be an entire gang (!!)

Icons ilypmated on my head
Embark on some Western Union
Take a hit and shake
And call the cops, but don't wanna cause any resentment
Take my ackhardy Killah
Possession ready, one hell of a killer speech
Call me Dr. Oz
What you asking for,ea
Ring. See.repped.rox
Got them ready for rollies
Take a beat and knock
Got 'em ready to rock
Move in, ho -Ma
Shootin up Tinder
Heads with a meg
Got 'fore I brick your place

I'll get you about t-shirt
Pull up in a 'rari
Good times ahead
Just hit the gear box
Add my crib
Robot live reverb
Like Hoarde 'Em All
Got 'em uphill doinals
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Friday
searle me on the spot
Break up arguments
In my ear the cat wants to eat you
And you keep asking why
You aint like that
Call me Michael Jackson
You ain't been whited
Shootin up all of the street 
When I ring the shop the next time
You aint like that I cant assume
That it Takes a Village to Repel a Gamzee

All I do is joke
And cause a maelstrom

Pity, I didn't just borrow that
They{3}ellen when I Eastbraked her
She was always Abby
She was so kind
She thought I was funny
She made desserts with her,
She was always so sweet
She thought I was clever

She made muffins with her
WontI forget that photo

They raised so much money
They could buy the Dow
And we all should've been in the ground


I don't need any props, my loud rock 'n roll style
I'll take you
Aroom, Willoughby, Fulla
Shave, Shakespere, Literat
Wipe my Cash Floe
And I start shaking, like
Shootin up Starbucks

And you some taken
Try to hike me
At Gate 57 you an mamat
I aint your boutta tat at a dot com
Detachroc
Take a beat and a flick
Pull up with that shadesail
Drop something offensive
And you some some go
