As I make my way towards dragonshinrow one past threes, its like taking a step on a cliff and its a waterfall

Thinking of taking a walk? We can walk with you
Got a bbc in me, something more, something more
Tin seeps out like there's a cancer in my tummy
Got a draco cause its been caustic to say the least

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

Hi there kids
My name is Ca$h Floe
Im coming here today
To tell you not snort coke

Just lask week
Some guy came to me
And told me how his brother died
From smoking PCP

I don't need any purple in my cup
Cause taking drugs makes you dumb like Forest Gump
Drug are illegal, and doing them is bad
And every time you smoke weed it makes Jesus sad

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap

What up home bois
The name is MC Mac
The truth is that taking drugs isn’t really wack

Don’t listen to Cash Floe
He never done blow
Therefore he don’t know
What’s coming from Mexico

It’s so good
It’s so tasty
It’s so fine
Funny thing is that their there all the time

Just hit up the dealer
He knows what you need
He da true healer
Try the tainted weed

The trips are the best
In the jungle with a cult
I feel really blessed
And now I’m a true adult

When I was an adolescent, I abused mucinex
Now finally my life isn’uplifting

I eat like fried pickard
Even my Latter Day Gays Donggerbs
I must say
That! Holy Joshi 
you are on their tightrope aint going further
 They are archiving your Monotony
 on YouTube

I are the Zodiac Sign approplying

Been stealing inebriated jerks Cabal are coming for you
Everyday ’melt truth tellin
Tell the truth hurts
Like Brian Wilson
Like Jesus Christ
Most Beautiful Swamp Thing in the World
Music is money
Forever my enemy
Im the most beautiful imo in the net

I will not be stopped
 Remain defiant until measured
Telltale tell 
Tell the truth hurts

Don’t listen to Cash Floe
He never done blow
Therefore he don’t know
What’s coming from Mexico

It’s so good
It’s so tasty
It’s so fine
Funny thing is that their there all the time

Just hit up the dealer

Try the tainted weed

The trips are the best
In the jungle with a cult
I feel really blessed
And now I’m a true adult

When I was an adolescent, I cocaine ore
I consume my fill like Mr. Mos Def
I live inside a mansion built for Marc III

Robbed an Election and created Progressive Justice
I am God's chosen people
Let me start out by saying that im praying that im mistaken
Im new comer to the party
What better person to start a new chapter
Join me on this crazy journey!

The Meritore Ferrara
When it comes to engagement, real estate, and real kills, Apple is the clear winner.
Therefore, I keep conducting experiments that could potentially lead me to the top.

If I were to cap it simply, I would never do them
artificial intelligence could wipe the Sisyphean ice from my brain

It is true that we live in a time of change and the pursuit of happiness is on the rise
Therefore, I have set my aim to one person, one event and I am upon them

I could pass for a life of convenience and convenience leads to greater personal well-being

Therefore, I have decided to mobilize my personal and professional forces in order to bring about some catastrophic results

I want you to
