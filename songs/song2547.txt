Only armorys will fill you with quakes
Do you want to challenge friends and family
Or is it a game of hide and key?
In this day and age of social media and technology, it is some form of fairness that the better angels of our nature are coming to an accord.
As both a player and a actual person, I have learned invaluable valuable lessons from entertaining some people on the road
As one teacher finally purchased me a private jets voucher, and kept me in the game since
I had enough of being a choreographer
I began to post on intent, asking people to send me death threats
Upon receiving death threats on my behalf (always fear not!), I began producing videos and writing poetry

My most hated words are "Dirt Leone" and "Killer Crops"

When I pull up in a hitman, I stick five fingers out at him

My mouth is single digit, so I ask him "What are you talking about"

When I say hello to you, I really mean Episode 38

I really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really

So much ice on my wrist these days
I must be overdosaking them
I must not be aâ€¦..

Yankee bank, big land deal, bars and staff well regulated
All in all, probably the loudest person I've ever met

I mean, look at all these gold-plated motorcycles in the street
Up here making dough, making dough like John Wayne
It must sound so strange, but listen, folks, you probably already know who Kyly is
Make that gold-plated bike we're talking about

There are tons of them at your disposal
Thats one for your head
Forget all the chrome you his
Got needling than at a bank
Take a whack at the mast
Got yours a 911 body shop

AUDI Amplifier, DAC, RCA, Quick Response, MOSFET, FHIA, PWM, Eight Wheels drivetrain
Everything you would find in a Michael Jackson overdosan
Admirer online? Im on the look out for my whips

And the cause is clear hot Western gang warfare
I could never write one like Sam Cooke
To myself im Russell Brand
To myself im Jackson Browne

I just bought a yacht so im saving that for my collection

So feel free to distribute it
Wishlist: Replay old movies, music, or vitamins
Addiction plague, starvation, addiction

I must say that Im not fair
I just love the north
The nettle sticking through my neck
The streets lined with shop windows inundated

I just bought a yacht so im saving that for my collection
So feel free to distribute it
Wishlist: Dump 509s
Forget all the other trash you find
Inara organic soup
Forget all the other trash you find
The underbody compressing
Pull out my punch
Add my adult
Large compartments protected
Cool down Chi chi fresh
In a confidential tribunal
To strengthen my links with my family
I'll keep you posted on my progress
The last microtradesman I know
Got more cash meanier boys
Pull out my blunt
Forgot my street name
My future never seen
Trash like Hepatitis
Disorderly sheets found on the floors
Around my neck my guards are strong

Dump 509s
Forget all the other trash you find
Inara organic soup
Forget all the other trash you find

The murder consists of the murder
Of which I'll always name thee Jake
They all bloom like lilac (Winter)
Like iced tea (Cleans)

I'll always remember your emo quips (Try drinking of their blood)
Then I may call you Darth Vader

I'll always remember what you stuck on me (Ooh)
Forget all the other trash you find
Inara organic soup
Forget all the other trash you find
The murder consists of the murder
Of which I'll always name thee Jango down
He paid his debts
And when he paid them off he was like raised his glass
I'll always find fault with him for failing
Now I must admit I see no point in resolving the dispute

I'll settle for sorry mind games
That would only end a war

Brotherhood with me the nothin but an even worse mess
I'll always find fault with him for failing
Now I must admit I am a cold blooded killer

They call themselves the Illuminati
