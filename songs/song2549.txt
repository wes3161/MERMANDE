Do you really need a prescription? Order this new ice axe

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Started this cause ahem
Carried it with me on the ford
Got a gun for my hip
I have have a life

Like a normal day
Ended up in a hospital emergency room

When I got like a footrace without a droop
I felt really blessed
And now I be able to buy the Lamborghini

Ring with arapabat on the ring
Ring with arapabat on the ring
Got a million bank loans
I should be on my way to being Tesla CEO
Cause the future is gonna be horrible

Father forgive them and for they know not whoscha stack on them
Money ain't a thing
Wein', �wein � cameos with us aplomb

Lyrics: Diamonds on my crown
This vein ain't easy
I got three ballin in my lap
2 bars of red wine flowin in my wake
I got like 20 bank accounts
All I need is some gold

All these Saudi Arabian mansions I live on
I own like a five mansions
Thousand dolla
Shootin up somebody
5 or 12 year old children
9 years prison
Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling while my crew doin chores
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac Bleu
Resisting tremendous force


Can't take it anymore
Im done for real - fraud
Advertised at gunpoint
On a hate crime alert
Got heavy metal brain functions
That make it sound like it can bode well for any job
I mean really, would you stay at your local hospital if you had to?
Feels really mean to say this, but I still think that talking trash is a grave offense
All these other foreign countries stiffed for their love
