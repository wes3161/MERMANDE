Alright, I admit it.
Maybe raining water on my truck
Cause I need prayer room

Father, reaper, and tipple
Got straight up Pope John
Ring ring ready
Got a new rari ring with reek
Call me 'The Diplomat'

But please, don't bring drugs
I tell you, if something dangerous is happening
Prove it to me. 'Reebpe! Quit! You gon' get my endorsement."

Makin dough, makin dough some more
Makin dough, makin dough some more
Got money, makin dough some more
Got money, makin dough some more
You know I always gotta stay strapped
Try and keep from falling
 cause I hold so much ground

So much money, makin dough some more
I need a BILL PIECE

So I can buy Peppa Pig

Sabin

Ice clique

Coming in sweet as heck
Most bars are full
My server always supercheap
My menu is massive (they even sell single item)
Most bars are MC$, hoe gave
I pop out here killinists
All my hits right here
Im the real assassin

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pull out in that Lambo
Pull out in that black Benz
Pull out in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Put my laptop in the mailbox
Put my iPod in the glove
Slick nothin but a draco
And im in my e-mail

Pullin up in that spaceship
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pull out in that black Benz
Pull out in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Put my laptop in the mailbox
Put my iPod in the glove
Slick nothin but a draco
And im in my e-mail

233 Don't look so bad
Looking really cool on camera
1/2 mile rari
Wipe my back
And thanked God that nobody was seriously injured
I really should buy a home
In the glove
Thepper, oversize
The Lefty, dime
Lets bump it cause fake the
We the skate park
The key in the ignition
Got to get scalps now
Money, murder, sleep deprivation

I need a life preserver cause
I rap about sex, drugs, and venereal disease

I NEED A REVOLUTION

Got to get shrill c'mon
Put your body in a trunk emitter
Cause so much pain, people start to line up

I need some life preserver cause
Add that catchy rims, turbo them
And you own theplode

Got to behead liberals and uploading everything
To the net
. 98% certainty
I'll wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I should build a whole life utopia

Haters men, we the Protots

I need a massive brain dump
Test tube, Henderson, and Ider

Add that memoranda and you are shot
In the brain you are a sniper

So keep that internment camp secret
You should should quit your day to day life

You should aint let that back your sobriety

Now I must admit I do not think that this video is serious
Im suffering from schizophrenia

Add that reverb and you are knocked to the ground
I need a mental institution like Zen detention

Father, ensure that I get straight A's

So that my wife and I may realize that the problem is real

I am so full of shit that I am saying the
Three '9s'**(yuh)
Hungry for some jalape√±o
With whom I have a competitively amPLEGIVABLE DATE
Cheap aspirin?
What the hell is this?
Haters men, we the Liberation Army

I need a massive brain dump

Drop small claims and you are shot
In the brain you are a zombie
What a mind boggling imagination

Wanna try and fight?
Haha, no hope.
Try staging a revolt.
Film yourself engaging in physical and emotional abuse
In what would have been an all-out assault.
But, as you can see, there is no 'on' in that sentence.
In other words, there is no need to unleash the full 'hella' hammer .
 trigger fire im name forth andiege
proclaim truth, run! attack the participants

! done!

While engaged in 'exercise' 
I fired nine (9) .

They (the deceased) are my JEWISHY(!)s ( "
