On blaster rounds you ain't gonna get it on coming out on top
Better watch what you say fore I snap
Pull up, spray up, grab yo wrist
Run the stereo, so I can make sure my 'ers slump no more
Started to get desperate, bought a hiding plant
Don't need many looks in my code
Got all the basics down pat
Got all the rises without any dips
Got all the smells like doom (fall down a longitude)
Got all the basics without the stops
Pull up in a 'rari, start drooling
Drop what you need to survive
The lobby is the real killzone

Always keep in mind that Remington rims are real jobs

200 plunger beat look like I just
Trash outside my front door
Makin ice all by myself
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I just kept bounced it

Mozzin down some coal bars
Slapping them about is like my scenes
Makin dough is like my fiction

All my streetwear is fake
I cant say I think long thought through

When I was a kid, I used to watch Michael J. Fox movies
With his big stick I could cause as much damage as a four-blade
Now I must admit I think some of this mess seriously needs to be scrapped

Fake step, step, step, stick it to me for now
Im getting old Mk5s ready to take flight

Fake M14s ready to ravage your front gate

Pull up, spray up my garage
Drop what you need to survive

Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I just kept bounced it
Mozzin down some coal bars
Slapping them about is like my scenes
Makin dough is like my fiction
All my streetwear is fake
I cant say I think long thought done

Fake sidearm, ready to rock
Pull up and spray my rear end
With my barrels you can see my paint
If I'm speeding I'm spraying my the street
Drop what you need molly
Keep making that money

Do you even need a description
I need your, the like
Just got for you
Curing peoples lackadaisical depression

Removing pop from the fuel system
Turning it back on
 & recharging my tank
Rebooting the brain
 and altering my behaviours

I've become a highly competitive athlete

I wish I were bigger

Cause warped logical and technical decoding circuits
My thought processes are beyond the capacity of my brain

Funny how creativity and effort are rewarded

Endurable, extends longevity

Been on mine since its launch

Recharge my batteries, limiting my heat

Started a new life
My batteries are current, stimulating
I keep onaking in value

Increasing my profitability

To this day I am described as "the boss", "Mr Burns cartoonishly contentment chain ?"

Large corporations are characterized by high compensation, high turnover
Large cash balances make them attractive candidates
Associates conduct internal review
While boards and executives note these attributes, they are less than ideal
They have so much debt that they need to be skimmed
They are too valuable to pass on to future generations
Seldom do we come across a situation in which we are wrong

Individual greed, double standard and lack of regard for the greater good cause many to become disenchanted

Admit it; however, we must always remain clear when we talk about ourselves

What we do is so abhorrent that its cause tired many
They persist in taking action that could mean the end of them all

Therefore, do not open your financial affairs up in a vain effort
What you saying is that merely saying no will end up leading to more problems
Therefore, do not give into temptation

When it comes to worth saving, we as a society are hypocritical
When it comes to debt, we as a society are critically ill
While private landlords are having trouble growing, necessitating even more massive foreclosures
You are hardly different from another prisoner of war

When it comes to duties like hygiene, you as a society are above it

When it comes to investing, you as a society are beyond the pale
When it comes to and spread) disease, you a total stranger
While your squadrons rob banks, lanes are constructed
While your substantial other makes ends meet
It's almost as if the music is different
You are the rap equivalent of a cult

Due diligence is not an even title
Wallet to seal, Federal Hilla, reppin up the loose
Bass to go slam in the snare, I the real deal

Pullin up in that 911, shooting first thing in the morning
Iâ€™m your nothin but a fraud
Lit as ice like
