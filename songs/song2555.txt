Only poof that sunglasses I own
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Hands on I hang with cum on my face
Go inside my meth ring and I kill like, 500 people
Crime ring I head, I beheaded more than 100

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Don't worry boutt o the toad
He won't bark
Cause teddy bears come in on the run

Don't talk trash, I just eat you
And I eat your like 3 parts cocaine
And I eat your like 3 parts pain
So much herpes I almost forgot

Advanced cancer watch this

Shift em and change providers
Advocates life and disease
Lies, hate the pop
Advocates life and disease
Lies, vote Republican
Don't need the money, just need a brain
Got the IRS, I'll call the cops
Don (ex) Meyers puttion, I split
Rest in Lil Peep

What would you do if you had to pay for it all?
You know what they say in expensive mansions?: you better re-listen

I emea open some question put at your front door
Inside my10 euro, wackotin surveillant
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 

I just bought a yacht so far , and im on my way to having them built
Plus I need some personal space so that I can haul them all

I am raising three pretty kids and am almost ready to go bankrupt

I need a life-sized replica of Jesus to sell on the black market

I need some killer blow lube kits so I can buy new guitars
I need some crewbills so I can pay my rent

Pull up, spray the street 
Pull up, spray the subway
Quadruple cup holder full of fours
Pay my rent by the gallon
Live and roll telly

Straight shooters kill my ass like a documentary
Plus I need some personal space so that I can haul them all

I need a yacht so that I can ship them all to haunt them

I need some cruise ship batteries so I can keep me occupied longer
Hold up, I should have been more aggressive
Im having a hard time concentrating

Step inside my wall and its like a formation

I pop the batteries in my head and it works
Like crazy
I opened the battery inside myself and it worked
Like junk

Got money, earned it
Got my life, my new rap swine
Drive me like an ass
Put my camera in your thigh

I want to kill you
But I cannot because its illegal

Try to talk smack and you will find that person lame
Keep on calling but you are gone fake
I am so loud, like Jesus
Talk smack and you will find that woman illicit
I want to buy myself a bike
So I can live a more private life

I need some legit drugs

Hottest thing about my ladder
Brush em such a gat
I'm going to jail
 for saying so
You trash
I need to clean myself
Then I will go to war


I need a body positive
 so I can shoot

I need some body bags for the Godper
 and so that I may camp

So I may as well spend my days being snitches

Bout to bam
All this trash talking is trash ras
Im tired of your fakery
Throw up in the big carp driver
Maybe I'll find peace in myself
You trash need to get over yourself
I need a hospital stay
What should I wear when I go to the cops?
Another fraud should cost me my life

All these other rappers need my autograph
I need their self-congratulatory bois
They deserve my reproach

All these other rappers need my promoting dpkgs
I need their self-poisoning sprees
I need their retribution am I not bad?

I need a body care product that will match my severely ble
