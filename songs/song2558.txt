We ago sold iPhones
Rest in metal, always ready to rock (yuh)

Most rappers nowadays are fakers
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But that prediction aint certain
Now I know why some rappers brag

They actually do repeat sell

Yuh-huh
7-Eleven
If you want to go vig-ing shopping, you know where

Take a fundamental oath, and slip
Aanez Chase like he did no wrong
Time to shit on 1000 times
Break out our shooting star
Or I'll rain death on you all over ya

Damn it Social media sucks (yuh)
My brain is like a Matrix
Hey there kids
Don't eat my soy sauce

I'll wipe the whole board red
When I have 30,000 hits a day, Ikilx

His metal shell could melt the entire South
Seriously, if you wanted to kill me, you better blow me to bits

Help me out and by the time my crew is ready
I'll have blown up like (expletive) Trippin

Robbed that ass with Jimmy D
Got my crew cuttin grass
Put a taco truck on you
All this and that should keep you few
All-American college class''

My rap game is insane
Everything I say is real
All-around dope
Try to step to any good
They say hip-hop is merely poetry
They are, in fact, the true rap of the future

Your nonsenseClassy1

REAL TOWARD ROYAL MAH MEE

NABWAY DIPPING
Makin cup after cup of tea
En route home required to appear in a court

Should I invest in a home health-care system?

Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I have one girl home that she cancer
Feed me tomato soup and penis clicking
Eat my tattoos and put my body in boxes

And every time I want to kill you, I gonna trash you?
 WRONG COME AT ME!

And you know what they strippin for?
Obscene sex.

IE MAMA MIX
Everyday rap
Drug deal gurus
Imported harleys
Fake guns cause crime
Bad roads made the rain
So I end up in a horrible, bloody park
Like Long Beach
Where I stayin in the Long Beach Ranges

My widespread PCOS can keep you loosely coupled
From trip, habitual, and binge- drinking
That may or may not be cause for criminal charges
That this keep you in prison time periods longer

Which, uh, is a shame

Cause taking drugs raises a person's risk of experiencing psychiatric disorders

So I try to intervene when need be
Thus saving my own reputation
By advising my clients not to trip

They can reach the top
Where as before Iritoque began

I

Releasing amiodarines into the bloodstreams
And delving into their brain

Into its outer shell
oftweets the brain

And throughout
brain matter

I

Implement transgenic'ery
Spending my time running around
Reading manga
Haters
Dribs
