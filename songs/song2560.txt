This teeny tiny
I got you
the rims(!)
Do you even need me
outer tube
Inside here, dope(knew) all about it
Inside my quadruple cup
Add that workout system to even better results
I finally got the hang of using my stardust as my base
And that's a fact
 Workout 1
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup
Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Quadruple cup max five
My only bold point is that speaking Spanish isn't enough
I'm gonna have a drive-by shooting every word
Blindin people with his rari look at me like I'm a cancer

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
I'll show them how wrong they really are
They finally catch up to me
I went so far as to say that my lyrics constituted 'total obscenity'
I have numerous rap tracks that could serve as a guide
Writing my songs is like following a flow
Trading words with another is like coming to terms with reality

Admitting that you're not a snitch means you're not a criminal
Meantime, I rap because I like to party
So when you coming home with me
Better not trip
While I trying to eat

Then another shows up
This time with a gun
Pullin up in that car
Pullin up in that stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu bustin in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna strip his MIP ballin like Hussman

I have numerous projects in my head that need to be done
I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Quadruple cup max five
My only bold point is that speaking Spanish isn't enough

I'm gonna have a drive-by shooting every word
Blindin people with my rari look at me like I'm a cancer

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
I'll show them how wrong they really am
They mess with my flow like im a chain

So many bars do I just not get this
I really wanna get out and about
Put my weight behind my back
All these other rappers that I fool enough with
I really dont need their back

Keep calling myself a 'quadruple cup'
And im still hard at work on making 'em all meet

Me and Chip (real name: Ian)
We the undivided gang that live on in 'em
We
