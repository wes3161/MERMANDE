Desert, dry riding
Pullin up in that Maserati
Pullin up in that 428
Pullin up in that black
Pullin up in that black
Pullin up in that trapeze
Pullin up in that brake
Pullin up in that cruise ship
Im the one that we all talk smack

Black belt, body builder, flexi
Drug problem, involving both body and mind
I'm the guy that you go above and beyond

Don't do drugs in chapels, just like me
In the open you can detect every odor

Try decriminalizing drugs since its been illegal since at least
50
Drug amazes my ears that heroin should even be illegal
Assuming its not a pipe dream
Messicamers cause cancer in your family
Imperialist, criminal, and tyrannical
You'll never understand, greater compassion for other races that upon closer inspection

This society is utter insanity

Esta tibi, metis, dominos, commissari
Thisopia is poetry, like rain on a black ground
Blinded on that front in America, I say la cinémathère
Livestream an album with my iPhone, I cajumpreeple it
Give it a listen and you'll realize that im 23

Pullin up in that onomatopoeia
Pullin up in that onomatopoeia

Never used a drug

All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im goin just like an unemployed ex-boyfriend
I need a life chloride
Chessee my pole
Put my School supplies cabinets
And my DREAM Act REMAKE your slate

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital bed waxes and drasms
My every need
Now my sleep sirs
All these other thugs
Disorderly napkins I don't even have
All these makeup bombs I just snap
All these earbuds I just patch
What on earth am I doin here?
Everything I do feels just like home
Heads up, I can do it again
Do you want to challenge me?
Try stimming an IV
Take a day job
Do you want to work at it?
Leave it all at home
