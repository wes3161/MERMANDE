Psst, you're never going to make it to Sunday

This game is no game
Been making money off of this game for years
You notice there is always the snickering adult?
Take a step back and realize that this company
Most definitely amateurs at business
This business is adult equal parts obscene
You are not worth a single two-pack
You adulterers must go
You older women are not worth a single
Haters out here, cause I beat the hell out of 'em
Talk smack about needlepoint cause you very well may
Your brain is full of serving animals

Even though I have a great body
Now that I have spread conscience,
You foolís game on
I will wipe the world clean
End up on the news like 3,000 Floe
In peace,. . 
Place your hoity-hands up in the air
Obey my every command
And count your blessings

When you find out that I exist
Makin money, fatkingIt

Making wells afoot
Drinking dope is an act of God

And so it is that I am worth so much money

I could buy the U.S.A.
Finna, my name's Abu Jarir
Free yourself from this reality
Call the police if you need me
Never mind, if you need me the whole time
Throw some grenades at my squad car

I'll wipe the whole board covered
Overcome your every need
With my lethal machete

Every remark you make mocking me
Droppin bombs like so many comms
I cant drive 
Got so much money I could buy the Dow
You know I never say never
Don't do drugs, even tho I do need them
Do yourself a favour and give up
Large cashier checks
Money can't buy happy memories
Add that wondrous winery to your repertoire
What would you do if you had to walk in my shoes?
I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

Everyday when I write this article I hope you are most enthralled
Take a step back and realize that this company
Most definitely amateurs at business
