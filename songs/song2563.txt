For everything from weight loss and prevention to weight loss surgery

You wont see any reindeer so strap in some weight

For at least twelve months of your life
Research shows that blissful paralysis
Environments devoid of love, hate, and scarcity
Cause you to be insufferable and worthless
End up on the news more often than not
Helpin you realize that you are not a person
Rather, you are a douche

Oh, and every time you try to rob me
They say strip down
They should buy my crib
Cause when I pull up in the rari

There is so much trash in this room
I need to –cli –clean

Empty space is a mental state
Coma pieces the head
Causes permanent brain damage

Injury-prone youth are at greater risk for developing depression

Gunnin up in front of you with ease
Shootin up at you from a higher position
And you at your most vulnerable
