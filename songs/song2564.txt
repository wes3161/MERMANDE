Scream louder than a gym rat

Add some fiber
For a good cause
They really mess you up
Started to get bold
Started with a different thought
Based in mind
My bold lowercase words
Let it roll (ayy)
For real?
This rhyme chop
My credibility peaking
Add some dimension (ayy)
Everything you would not expect
Experiment on me, without I would not happen
For real?
Do you even know what you're thinking?
Just scribble this down
For real?
What a shame
Look at all these platinum plaques
I should buy a home
Large tanks are what we are
The adult that I am
I am society
That bars outside electronic equipment
Plus many homeless pegini
That we breaking the news to
Plus many, many heartthrob stories
To myself
