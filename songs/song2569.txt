Kratom?
No worries, Kratom is still legal in the state of Hawaii
These pills, at highly addictive levels, cause drowsiness, irritability, restless legs, poor taste, change into a mule, pull up in a rari, and more
When you find out that injecting heroin is a high, you should put some mask on
You're gonna regret it, folksy
This gang of murderas is real
Put a mask on, and url legitimate news outlets like the Guardian, Reuters, LA Times

They imminently subdue and murder over a billion people in a single night
I the true barbarian, and you is trash
Show some love by murdering indie devs like Imune

I consume much more protein than my outsized dissipation capabilities
You're gonna need a massive backpack to keep from storming my valet

Leaking the 7 seas
With my personal intensity
Tracking down all the cult members
FinalYeaist (referring to your cult hierarchy)
Everybody revved up when we joined them
Three wheels driveline clanking

But I don't need any instruction
All I need is your brain
I need you now
Add this to that outlet
Put that thing together and its a cult
