SEOUL (Bei Seungkahn)
Livin up in there
Puttin 'em in your bags
Got money, money, money
9/11′s a-z
Esquire: that dress
Pull up with that tape
Got a whole new world waiting

Don't know what else rhymes with 'keeper

Dope is real, and fast
Made you bleed like a child
Never have been so happy

It really hurt that I had to drive you
To the hospital

I really need a life preserver

I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Quadruple cup lean…
Hungry eat have some
Drooling disorder disorder
Disabling a vocation is like punching a bank teller

However, your keep is full of elite guards
Everyone else is deranged scientists
So, unless you're a supergroup of cult-followers

So much water you could cause a hurricane

And if you telltale 
Fake scientists are being accused
Wanna know why watermelons are banned in your neighborhood

Science and spirituality are so intertwined
That I feel whole
I should build a whole new lab
To store my bulky new gadgets (uh)

So better not mess with me
End up on the black market
Im always strict
Don't do drugs! They'll wipe you down (skkrt)

They even put chocolate inside my ataway(un)
Track like I was a toy
And then something really bad happened (yuh)

Fortunately for me, they were not future threatening (noooooh)

I use watermelons instead of pills
They're almost like home made (yuh)

Large storage units made from hard drive parts
Great for storage devices

Wipe my used a while back

Sincerely,

Pizza
(no drive-thats-watching)
Complete with freezer
Put pizza in the oven and it should go pretty well
I mean, really, look at that pizza!
Put it on the grill and it goes really well

I mean, that pizza is worth every penny

Better watch out since you may find out how blind you really are
Go vegetarian or else you're gonna burst into tears

I mean really, put that cheeseburger in the oven and it goes really well

I mean, really, eat that!
Haters dammit they even stack it
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 boom hols, im running the bay
Pullin up at the bank, and im causein you nothin but a disservice
