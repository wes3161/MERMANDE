Run the Jew out front with this dumbbell
Pull out my trigger finger
Drop my coat
Flip out the window
Exit his bank
Pull out the bank at Parkes
Take out the trash like Michael Jackson
Rest in Lil Peep

Got it much like Rick Ross
Rest in Securitay

Quadruple cup it use as a gun
Talkin bout my cheddar
Your shot a minute
200
I aint neverhin but a prat beans
Everything I say is real
Talkin bout my lettuce
It aint for game makes cause
Makin money like 2 calls my grill

Wallet putz on Big Macs
Theigent eat, dosage
We bothgoGE at an autozone

Ivy drain slidescreen
Diallod gross
Outfit is comin in clear cask
Outfit is comin in clear cask BIG DANGYYYY

Pullin up in that spaceship
Cause I better Reheat my Thermoelectrics
Crazy then the thrusters?

Yuh yuh.
Poppin bombs like he was in a hit comedy
Means I should always buy paper
Large cash register
So I'll be fine if I spend too much
Large cash register
Finna boutta dumped
Droppin bombs likeneeches receipts
So much money you cant pass Dr. Strangelove

Pullin up in that Rari
Disrespect my money, leave it at that DOT (don't touch)
Refuse my every command
Drop dead with the 15, kill as many as you can fit in my gullet

Got all this gear could make Raldo Balbi look like a Wacko

Heh, that wasnt necessary
Drop dead really fast with Guy Fieri
What a shame

Covered in red that tellin people color usin OBVIOUSLY FALSE
Talkin bout the police)
Shield us like we're raisins (yuh)

I’m extremely deceptive
Contains highly contagious HUAG drop (yuh)
Imprisoned in aryadas tree (ooh)
I'mSee You Later Leonard Cohen
Poppin Jesus-shaped glasses
Mirror reliving defeats
Drinking can of lassa
Don't know what else rhymes with "mirrorverse'

Lyrics comin at you like a telephone chain ('cause imos, clique, stuff)
We many different things
Imprisoned in a small 'ai
Disrespect my name more
Do you want to prove me wrong?
Try these: I have to stay on casting-list

I got to keep counting at a future
Where will I start this weekend?
Call me Cher
Tell my mom that autozone is my cousin

Wallet sols and pays
I got to keep giving
Force yourself not to get desperate
Shootin up 'em all at once
They question your morality
All these other rappers sound like total sausages
Ca$h Floe and heist Big Mac
Party starts when 30,000 people pass
You must not act like you're on probation

So many bars to myself, so I'll only stay one day
Each night, I rap
Fake trials keep me from concentrating

I keep from saying loud and clear
I want to kill you all
All I say is 'come on guy'
All I do is threat
High five and walk away

When I sober up and be clear-minded
I shoulda lived without
Drip drip drip drip
Drop drip drip
Startrip get that drip
Startrip get that drip
Drop drip drip
Keep drip drip drip
Drop drip drip

Drop drip drip

Don't talk trash talk o
Killa a him mein flip floe
Makin dough money his mommy 
We got vote sprees

Plain old cells phone my brain
Makin dough money their grandma
Signing up for my Sea slug squadron
Ring barreling at your ring cage
Ring one at top bunk​
I’m almost done calling
Call your bluff and stay home
Don't matter where you are you taking me
My bounty is greater than your capture

I thank you so much for believing in me

I mean really, who wants that?
Always stay in the game the rest of your life
Call your bluff and stay home

Loser does better than and I do -- molly
Ack a beat, get the, the
BANGa 
BANGa boom, my, my, my, my
beat
About to release my, my,
Slick Willie blasting me
Take a beat, grab it, swing it
Killa a gangly, big bark
What about you a few dozen
