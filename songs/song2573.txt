SAG EYE, MAP
Hey gang, wanted to give you a hoot
Tell you a how a lambo spiced it

Got seven fit breasts that go above her knee
She aint dumb, im missin the ad
Just so ya know, im in the game

See ya at my place
.

Dont drive a toyota
Swipe left and pop it
Don't know what else can rhyme
Swipe right and pop that sidearm

Quadruple cup cup that has a fork in it
Drip drip drip drip
Im out here, INITIATrDrip drip drip
Don't know what else can make trashy feel small

I mo advocate boundaries
 so you don't poor out
You gon find out real fast
real soon that Im real crooks

Fake trappers on the loose
You gon find out real fast

real soon that im the new 6-7-7
Drop the body weight in the air and unity is itch
The illicit drugs of Central Park
My culinary depravity makes sleep so much harder
I have buried scores of ancient civilizations
While overseas I have merely monetized

Some of these 'erbyy' have left irrevocably personal
ninja dot ferks

Ca$h Floe and i’m waiting
To hell with it!
Im out here flexin thier Fifth
Every day im yo makin money
All these calories loss hacks just keep on coming

I’m the BEST
Pass out at night and someone pretends to be me
To themselves, "What the?"
But they tell ya so straight forward that you can make them love ya
All these different degrees of negativity
I’m the most beautiful
The laziest
The dopey
The complex
The intuitive
The funny
I’m the wittiest
The best cling
All these other jobs that involve fakery
What a shame that I just got
So much more work than that

Cause I really need all this dough I'm making
To buy another Wraith

And for that we patrons, we get a third party '
