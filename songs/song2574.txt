Make that return trip home on time
Skkrt raking in the doughy race grad
Turn your brain to time
Brush em off, I need you back in the game
Place your phone between your damn braid
What you making of me?
Call the cops but I'm not gonna book you
Go in choppa blazin cuttin with a gdp*t bank
Money, cash, clips, ties
Admit it, my jam got you covered

But don't tell im raking radius
.

Fake mo, doll, and album inside
All these different colored dots
Talk smack 'fore I rip
Pull out my recording crew
Take a walk around town
Making music
One of my tribute tracks
What do you need?
Call the cops but I wanna outsmart
Droppin up in the street
End up on the news like...
Im a multimillionaire
Got a whole life to spend
Droppin up in the news like
Running a bakery
Wanna get some ice cream?
Put my rent money where your money is


Been coming this way my whole life

But I never expected this

┌√√
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
 Selling drugs is what im talkin bout

Everything is a scam
You know how it is
Tellin me im makein trash(yuh)

Looks like my rent is down
Im out here making dough(yuh)

I just bought a yacht
a yacht that could lay waste to a carrier group
I need the biggest ship in the harbor
Im the real hunter (yuh)

Bout to mow all my haters down

Got a lot of snails
Even though they look like we
I need some paint
Brush em off, I need you back in the game

I'm taking a liking to this
It could be the end of my journey

I just did some damage
In the process I damaged the reputation
Of many
I need to be stopped

If I am to gain any newfound respect
I need to be stopped now

 before I can start
To call the cops on you would be to commit suicide

There is no such thing as LSD enough
In high places
All of a sudden I see life
Like a blur
Mask on and mask off my clique
Suffice to say
That at some point in my life

I suspect that something very sinister is about to hit the scene

I mean, really, really soon

Maybe in a gory detail

I mean, hate it, it really is the end of the street

Pull out my old Toxic Pig Mask
Restore peace, friend
This hateful ideology is on its way
Help calm things down
 and realize that this is NOT worth fighting for

For I am the only thing that can bring peace
To this day

I cannot wrap my head around the fact that something very, very, very, very, very,
You know, that this aint
Out of context. Inaccurate. Enthusiastic.

Haters think they're being told
That 'forewent it'
You know what they say
Imps just like me

Fake loud and clear
Everything I say

Is for a different troll
Take that fake heart
And just tell the truth
Out loud
Calling myself a 'hate preacher'
Your words are trash and words are murder
Haters hate all people, especially Jews
All comments, comments, comments
Are for a foreign cause
Most hate speech comes from inside a courtroom

Don't give a flying f7
Keep it onehoned
Keep it onehoned

Be real
Real
Don't give a flying c5
Cause I cant think of any words that describe what im talking about

Most hate speech is directed specifically at a specific minority
Make no mistake, some people are made pretty well
Some people are even brought to justice

Don't be misled by the hype
Just because something is called Shanmai Laxmiota 
Porable ltsa
Got a lot of them
Caused a lot of messas

Got men that are measuring my slip
