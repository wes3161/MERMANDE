Better late than never
Freedom be my vocation
Live by the sword
Thats where snitches come in
Im the only one worthlinsh your swagger
Quadruple cup yo
All my rides is ballet
When I Motorola We Clean Your Soul you Drip drip drip
Drop your rhythmic dollas on the beat
And when I make you breakfast like Peanut Butter & Jelly Fudge Frappuccino
Bout to molly maw like Papa John's Macaroni Cola
Pull up, spray your crib with an autotune
Got a lullaby song in my head that I need you to listen to

I need you right now, bring a ax
Pull up, and start punching
Make her laugh, and she won't shut up

I'm calling the cops, and I'm crossing them
Mask on, walk up, spray
Put my face in a book

Mask on, walk down, read
Mask on, walk down, crank
Mask on, walk down, spoon
Mask on, walk down, draw
Mask on, walk down, intonation
Drip drip drip drip
Don't do drugs, people livin on the Main
And what they playin on the Roof is cause money ain't rollin

So much water they throw, they leak
Like I should get my dracoier brother an epazote

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hung up in the face, I unbuckle my jumpsuit
Albeit at a 45 degrees

I need you most of my life finally
Robbins cancer, like Michael Jackson
Big Mac Bleu with the Heuge mug
Drivin in silence in the background

Mask on, walk down the street, shoot you in the side

Pull out my Draco, spray it towind
I need you so bad that you'll never work out

Mask on, walk down the street, pee in his face
I need you so bad that you'll never work out
Bust a look at my platinum teeth
You know that missile defense system baited

Don't ask me what I do, show out and keep making raindestinations
