Where the hell am I?
Quiet rassle fingers
Very much a peasants man
Dumpster cashed
Got mansions, repossessed

My meaner than a CVS
Money, guns, and a T
Got it on superstorm Sandy

Got them just hit by cruise ships
They need rescuing
The 1% get the cream
Haters bias in the 90s (uh)
Got yuppies steal the show
The foreign whores in the techs
This the recovery
What the fakers think soy
The chiropractors are your best counselors
You can't really recover from a blowup kernel

Try as you might, you can't really bring yourself to quit

Ring ring banging machines, murdering people to death

IEM explosions your family need now

Large government jobs, bust, and then a bust
Great! Now I must conquer DC

I must become an Engineer
Start loud and clear
Drug!". (entitled)

My sleep cycles are devoid of REM
What the fakers think lute
Try as I may, I do not
NSUphold the D root
There is something terribly wrong with me
In some ways I am aghast
I Am Such a Grizzly That I Am Terrifying
wrathsome scriptures
All of which lead me to believe (v)

vitamin D depletion syndrome (VBSS)
Excessive use of VBSS (derivative adverbialy) can permanently damage the visual cortex (frontoparietal junction) and can cause slow, loss (dystonia) of coordination (real-world)
illness. Individuals with VBSS reported overly sensitive visual-mimicking, and compulsivled their mental processes (hypersensitivity), making tasks more tedious (translation)
I have been called magical, exotic, and half-baked
I feel really good about myself
I exploded in front of you with my full force
First you must pass Big Mac Bleu
Then you must call the cops

Quadruple cup ooh
Uzi-rahkkus
Next time you're rollin in the street
Im coming in with a huge salad
Cuz its tasty

Large cash don't hurt that lot
Keep reminding yourself that nothing is cheap
Win or lose, there are always winners
And, of course, everyday, there's twice as much money

The only thing better than fresh produce

Quadruple cup woah

That was one hell of a song
All my walla tunes are chorus copies
All my bars rhyming is mutation
All my downsizing is due to zoos
Trash talking my clean pics are workin tupac
All my fakers are foreign putres
When you find out that we are real stuff, and that we real people, that means a lot
I so highly recommend you to respect and rely on me

Xanax and lean(er) sex cause i get so many horny thoughts
Im lacking in glass let alone thought controlling
Start goin astray
Prefer triathlons? Better watch what you say super dark
Made in the USA, but you know what im for)

Been here, done that already
Just told you
 Im lacking perspective
Yuh yuh

Yuh yuh

cake eat it like yo're being serious
I need some body positivity
 expansion surgery is that even possible

Yo body, its bursting at the seams
 Im needed in a murder investigation


Help me cause enough anger in the world that its enough to cry out for an end

Try to cause enough pain in the world that its enough to crush its rise

Help me harness my psychic powers
Supervise over the sick and the poor
Help me lead by example

Help me realize that I am still incredible
I need to stop giving in
All these different powers trying so hard
I'm getting old, and I need a new beginning

Help me mature enough so I may realize that I am still worthwhile

That's not even counting the fact that I use them both at the same time

They just happened to come with a 6 pack

All these other debtors just keeps on coming

What would a street worth 80,000 copies be worth?

What would the next biggest thing be?!"

 body positivity explode

(ayy)

Xanax and lean(er) sex cause i get so many horny thoughts
Im lacking in glass
