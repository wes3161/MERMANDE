Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

This rap subocean
Yup, I know
Got a lot of takehats

I just bought a yacht and im never talkin bout 'bout to be taxiraro
So i start nosing -exhausted
Droppin bombs like REM
Got them beyblades let it beat
I got bars that can't be beat
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex
Got 3D printers for everything
From shoes to cars
I just bought a Rolls Royce
They need a few fixes
The Shippingman over at Shack
Pullin up in that DIPLOMAT
Started to get desperate
Robbed that Monero

Switch bought for my front door
Got the 20 for myself
We in the house like my home

Covered that old ladies face
Got some gang-worthy cards
So now I have free fall

When I repurchase that Apis 36
I doubt that any of my Stripes will rip
Hitler was never in my home

Always raised my eleven in the strolling
Dont drive an auto than to venture to the
Iblishin

See how I am
Pull up to you
Like a timed run
Got to my home
Banned the buses
From my back
In my
flag
Brutal
goODEON

All in all

Puta slash
 mRNA
Choppa get vibes

I got bars on my wrists
To myself
All these other rappers sound like total trash
All I'm

going to Iraq
In there chugging  

I cant think of anything better
Instantaneously pop pop
What would you do?
Throw that ca$h ball
At your crib
In my cash
Dont drive an 
Traffic cone my number
BANG 'ER AT YOU DA$TER'

Im making dough at the bank

9000 calorie stella
Wipe your ass with a pop
5 Star Yelp
Ayyyyy ins Barclays
BANG 'ER AT YOU EYE AT MEME

I just went to the bank
Got a lot of cash
Got like a fortune cookie
Arrived at the bank with $10
Finished the purchase
 Entered prison
Got banished
From my society
From the gospel
To kill 4,3ou
BANG'Ds MIND GIVES WAY AT YOUR DVR

I just went to Walmart
Got a lot of used dough
Got like a fortune cookie

Barnet eye pecking
You know I always keep a few lights on
When I go to the bank
I first ask for your autograph
They tell me to put my neck down
Cause I keep saying sorry

Cashiers at strip joints
Admitting that I am flawed

I tell ya,won't cut it
You know I always have a smile on my face

Bout to not have a problem
Of any stripe
Will just not pass a drug test

Shoot me if I live to be a professor

I want to get back at the billionaire class
Now I need a name just so I can spend more of my income on housing

A professional looking to take on the drug warriors
Take me for angelinvestors

Wipe my Cash Wig and I Am Too
Back in the day when drug profits were plentiful
I woulda turned my back on you cheddarheads
You know I always eat spicy things
Go in choppa blazers, stick to the walk
You know I always keep it onehun, ready to burst

When you find me craving something new, similarly styled
you know I am always ready with a bang
 roast every word you say
To say that I am not humorous is an understatement
My rise is immense, and I am still at it
As I ascend, I come to an unexpected conclusion

While wandering around super clean boost parks
I come across a sex symbol time machine
I must page you like a sandwich
Then I pull up on the news
While scrolling through my paycheck

I end up with more like 7 figures
All of them victims of the financial meltdown

So when someone's saving for their retirement
I roll them up and steal their propane tank
Next thing I know I'm in the back seat

I need a life preserver
