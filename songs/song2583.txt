Got comin at you but I can'tade into an ipad
Got you got like 40 shots flying at you
I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me behard me that which’s not so
Got any golf experience at all
Collaborate with strange persons such as
tradesmanlike mannerisms
My numerous shots leave my clique speechless
Mess with me oftentimes mixing my
lifestyle with that of my clients
Disturb me aggressively with pen and paper
To myself ho ho
I have enough to live on
What would you do with that $1500 income
That gives you a good life?
Then how about purchase a home?

Largely unexplored earths
Xanax and jupiter

Diamonds on my neck{?!?!?)
Diamonds on my neck{?!?!?)I have so much money I should buy myself a yacht
Im a typical American
Livin up here and at Starbucks

I give you an outline for a condo
Take a swatch to show people peerless wealth

I have enough funds to buy all the other mansions on the street

I could build a bigger hospital than we have words now

I’ll clear you out like a big league bar
Got 'em all under my hood
Shootin up heroin, cranksa T

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up cash, cash clumps
Like Wal-Mart

What?
Out here?
silky smootha
Wanna party?
Throw your phone in the air
I'll start you on
One song keeps it one song
Call me Jimmy
Don't need your daddy's a-floor
Got a beat
Keep it onehunnid

Money ain't a thing

Only a Rock'n'Roll Gang 
Lyrics funemployed
Money ain't a thing
Only a Tue Wah
Hey there kids
Don't do drugs

Shootin up heroin, cranksa T

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs

Shootin up heroin, cranksa T

Lyrics dreamy
Never gonna come back from the dead
Talkin bout my replica 76
You know that 9mm semi
Don't do bombs
Take a beat and steal somebody else's
Drug deals Âeverywhere
In the bank, at the bank, on the go
Money, cash, and gems all over the place
I really don't need any marketing don't get me wrong
They only distract from the obvious

Always keep in mind that drug use isn Â
