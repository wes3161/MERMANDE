I went out facing asphyxiating and my friend died

My stepmom tried to sell me some weed
I raised my voice not to step on your head

When I went to pick up a gun, the stray bullet hit me in the gut
I had to be stappin

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that lemonade

Wipe my mess with legend
So no one can find me wastefully

Delivering opiates is a travesty

Thousand quid, cash, and stashed
