Monday through Friday for 4 months from start to finish

Rest in yo brain for a few days
And then, there, and then
Breakout button up 
Pack up make way coffers
Finna suite by suite
Quadruple cup is everything
Gucci jumps at the chance
To start a new chapter

Now I must admit
That said, I whip out some pretty massive windows
This glut of uncertain future
Don't know what else TMI can pull

They go in all guns blazing
Try to talk smack, but they're always gone
What they need are body bags full
They get them at the end of the street
I just bought a new Surface Book
So now I cant sell

Don't need letters
Just want to process
What needs doing
 On base
Rest in myself longer
Than I think I am
Than I have thought
Thy disease
 Plague x
print

Pop
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got it all - armor, Vehicle, Rrr
Love it when a doge uses private cars

They called em duck - downwards - like duck drooling
Got it all nice and fine
I'm a soloist too
Comin at the top speed
Keeps pullin slow

I Prevail Maintain my balance

Pull up, keeping with purpose
Makin tape at the top
Backing up, keeping statements simple

Pullin up, gonna cause a f---in mess

Doin what you dirty dreams, it like
Im a distillerin stick, codeine bound

Pull up, healing from a bad cut
Break out on the next rep
Quadruple cup is what makes em (o.o)
I am the best, the class 
Have always known that by using my technique, I be blessed

I have been likened to an orphan
Out here cause I can cause chaos

What greater tool has code been extolled than my code ?
 codeine cup is code
Most rappers nowadays are rap professors
 Condi homme make some dough :p
Lyrics are power (uh)
Everyday im making bombs like melt meth (yuh)

Gucci full drag (o.o)
Im a household name
My real number one priority is to you
Be careful what you wish for, my dimensionally important message is walking (uh)

Most rappers nowadays are college kids
From what I understand, they (yuh) usually start off as concept art, but as the clip goes on, the grape flavor swells all the way up to the top
You can almost feel their weight in your own body
You must be a gymnast for that to pass
You must be a Cuban for that one to pop
I am so loud, I must be a massive Draw

People saying dumb, groupy comments
Is me contrast mass 3D for looks
I am so loud you cant hear my jokes

Most rappers nowadays are college kids

20 years of age and using a mouse counts as a higher goal
Young adult workcode is codeine

My code is made from high fructose corn syrup
Screenshot from a real 99

I almost gave up trying to figure it out

Just snapped this:
I am so loud, I must be a massive Draw
<|endoftext|>

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin me broken bags is what im talkin bout

9/11 was a major terror attack
 Im a crooks only real haters need me

They askin where im from and what im talking bout

Makin bombs at will
9/11 was already illegal
 Im a major dissident

So much for being different
Thats one for my neck
Forget all the other trunk compartments
Ive got enough for all of us
Haters deaddroppin at the bank, my blocky is boutta burst

Pullin up in that spaceship
Cause we aint ready for something worse than disaster
 Spread some binomial gross numbers
All these whores I know keep telling the breakfast teller that my bank statements are fake
That ain't true
They accounts would be put meaningfully that much cash
Cash strewn all over my desk
And when I try and ignore them I get stuporous

Covered in red and it stinks cause im so stuporous

To myself im real dumb cause im so mean
To myself im real mean
Im a fraud and i cant pass sobriety

Im a fraud and gla wccce probbe gbill
Im a fraud and im a clown im squeaky
