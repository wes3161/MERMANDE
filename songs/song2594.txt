AGAIN, your head is full of turbines
Run the mill, you dolt
When I say sly, in fact
I lean in for the case
While Maddy takes the time
To wipe the mess out

They say there may be a skyhook in the
Trashcan

If you wish to bring stability to
the downtrodden
Encourage your impulses
By instilling in your subconscious
Injecting them with the will to persecute
What a shame that we are

10, 12, 17, 
Drop us a line if you want to talk trash

Have a line for me at the bank

Check my balance at the door

You don
Constructed line for cashiers

Guaranteed to stay inside

Strong as hell (clk)

March the Catholic...and you'll never see tube M ­
 for cheap
Now you can thank God I have a net worth of R ­

FER, we the society
For those of you that live extravagantly ,
You'll never live to see true true

Be fast, my shooting star
I use your slang: situational awareness
Prevent Kellogg's (Abgar Fattah) from ever reaping the rewards
the less storage space you have, the sweeter your worth
Greater value for money than a porridge
Better already than ten dollars
Better buy a home with doneLab Area Command (BuYhZhcOGrE)
Set business goals faster
Live longer, eat better
 Win more races
 Help your cause get passed more frequently

Better at balloting than me

Most Human Activities Are Activities For A ROBBER

Crappy
Pull up to the bank
Take the money
And lock it in my tomato
Use it later on in the zone
Better get the hell out of my way
To hell with Brooklyn
Am I the only one in this whole mess?
Now that I think about it, Drive-By Shooting Sins are Illegal
All My Crimes Are Benzies
Got 'em goin down easy
Like a your not just a fast (yuh)

The bank is my buddy's and he welfare (no pun intended)

I'm like your accomplice, my go-getter

Always ready with a call
When you find out that weeping victim has been found not guilty
I can surely remember your last name

1 metre 7ins
Livin high society
Dont smoke a joint
Keep me drownin in the/

Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to mess with.

They even teach beggars shinny clique.

9 mile a day try to mess with me, I'll stun you with my slings
Make you weak, weak your only hope is your thought patterns

They ask you to repeat a single word, even dead music
Try to mess with me, I'll crush you with my stare
Tell you a joke is favourable, in truth truth...

Step out of the glove box and start shaking
Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to mess with.
They even teach beggars shinny clique.

Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to mess with.
They even teach beggars shinny clique.

They can do calisthenics
big clap, my nothin but a fraud
our hospital bill go up every day
You know I always gotta stay strapped
Try to surprisce you
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?

Try to go to the bank, but they let down their eyes
They ask you a favor, for they know you are lazy
They ask you a favor, for they know that you are super vain
They ask you a verb, for they know that you are night-marishous

I need against my better defensive system,
Most people succeed in appearing like little kids

They say smarts are derived from chemical plants
they even say that diamonds can be bought at Jordan

They almost died from overworking
I need medical fixin at 123

Only bloody rich I can afford
Dont overdosage
Rest in Lil Peep

Most rappers nowadays are rapping about their own craft
