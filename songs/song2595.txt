I live inside a mansion and im getting done prescribing

I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
Ask me "Ca$h Floe how you get so sick?"

Life is too stressful
For someone as important as myself
To keep mezebobs where we are

Disaster is coming

All these other girls are required brethren

I feel really blessed
And now I know
What it is I need right here

So much gold dust
That I should buy myself a ring
Ring better start shaking
Started me go slow
Large money(uh)
Only a fool would take these risks

This addiction makes me more dangerous

I need a prescription now

OP Pharma, buy me some gold s***

End up on the raid
In the name of duty
9/11 was about as far as I'm concerned

Magnets are for bringers only
This insanity will not cease
My destructive ways will be realized

I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip

I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Even though I live above it

Drived me nuts forever
Always try and keep pace with the Daleks

Wanna try and talk blues?
Droppin bombs like Gaza 
Drop money on the Typhoon
Busts like Rafiq East
Got them shrinkwraps
Now my guerrilla cause smoke screens
Blind no man
Area zero 

I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
I need a life preserver cause im drowning in my clique
Everything bad spray talk me straight
