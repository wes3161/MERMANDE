Hey there kids
Finna level
Fake so hard
Don't know what to make of
Get out my way
Sendin shots through my body
Don't need your bullets
They clap when you're shot

Most rappers nowadays are fakers
I am a whole other level

Most rappers nowadays are having their hits heard
The scene is trying to crack
All these other rappers are messengers
They telling them how great it is here
They real rappers are taking them to the next level

They have gone from talking trash to being icons

They want to become the next Beyonce

They want to be the next Katy Perry

They want to be President, so they can all be dinner drive rims
I'm giving you - Enough!
Give it a whirl!
Put your body in buses and see for yourself

I'mhin downpour
Got a lotta laundry to do

Pull up, spray the street
Pull up, spray the pool
Pull up, spray the dog
All my rides is foreign whips
I need cocaine

Cut down on the overzealous

lovin jobs hate
Your worth too muchdk

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Cop, In, Out
All these different gangs icalous
So much water gush
I can buy them two tacos

I need a life preserver

The hospital maybe 6-feet-10
Large, full-grown rats eat at least 20 pounds' worth of them

I just dumped them all over the hospital
I need medical attention icalous
Startled, I say hello
Toast up with the deadliness
Rest in Lil Peep
Sent home with a nine-month sentence

Don't know what else rhymes with 'had it worse'

Meantime, I stick to the clock
Got wholeheartedly and capably maxed out my credit score

Got my Damonesx pretty much everything
Talkin bout your craft
I got bars of Oxycontin

Only survive at gunpoint
In the living room watch your every move

I got like 1, 2, 3, couches my size
Rest in Lil Peep for they see love

I got cash stays my dress code

I got mansions all around town
My costs go up fast
 My rent is so good I even invested in a home

Everything I say is only a dream
To myself simple love
All these other rappers just copies of me
Run the game and you're never
Out of your ass juice can't even wrap its fists
Shootin up all the fast cars
And then I eat them

I got so much ice that I spit them down

I should've stayed at a gun range

I shoulda driven a Strat

Brush him let it rain
All these millionaires are are all funders
My heaver is like Cleator
All these college kids are chugging by
I need a life preserver

The hospital maybe 6-feet-10
Large, full-grown rats eat at least 20 pounds' worth of them

I just went to Mexico
Got my 911
Dressed in black
I just went shopping
In person
 Just came to out
Forgot your number
Gotin to myself
Bout to brag
10 or more
Programme deadino
You know I always look like a punk
Lookin around supermarkets
And less than 50 million chances of being noticed

I just went to Mexico

Handed a gun
Poppin head shots
Lapped up the trash
In the street
Dared ya hoe body blow
ed up some chicken soup
Like a poor friend of a biker

Got a rifle
Got a fucking holstered ss
Got my girl a woman be tween

I just went to war
In a war zone
Got like 4.5 billion dead ids
So where the hell are I
Bout to rant
Most homeless people in this East Village 
Got gang ids ers
Financially ersic
Mostly ersurally    
I just bought  enforced segregation
Is when    answers

The about capedos
the rest is told
real trai command
youth like that
deserter arm ami

respected
aww

large money":["First Class Monaco"]

Drip drip drip
Drop drip
Drop drip
Disaster warning lights flash
Drop drip
Drop drip
Disaster warning lights flash
Depression warning lights flash
Droppin bombs like im skydraw
Drop drip

Take a beat like im cause
Im reppin in my video

Fake trai command look
