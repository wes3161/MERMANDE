Forget Dexter Lin-ph
Forget Michael Jackson
Don't start bike bugs
If you see 'ers twice your asking price
Put something good in the cloud
Should we forego carbon monoxide
Forget all the other EPA regulations
Better watch what you eat
Forget the fact that I still mess with mylefucka transhumans

Bout to molly
50 cal Barett
Thousand wash bank bags
Three eyes open so you clowns can’t roll me
Got any draco cause I never call the po-lice

They gon kill you whole 
Dont try and follow em through
Drive by your car
Startle you, say hello
And I
Here you at autozone
Got your copy protected too
Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

Hi there kids
My name is Ca Crosaghdann
Im coming here today
To tell you not snort coke

Just lask week
Some guy came to me
And told me how his brother died
From smoking PCP

I don't need any purple in my cup
Cause taking drugs makes you dumb like Forest Gump
Drug are illegal, and doing them is bad
And every time you smoke weed it makes Jesus sad

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs

What up home bois
The name is MC Mac
The truth is that taking drugs isn’t really wack

Don’t listen to Cash Floe
He never done blow
Therefore he don’t know
What’s coming from Mexico

It’s so good
It’s so tasty
It’s so fine
Funny thing is that their there all the time

Just slip on some gold-plated slipcases
They let go all the way to your front door

They trafficking in gold-plated bars
You know these bars give you magical properties

You must be a super hero to be on its blinders

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let down
They substitute hydro
For rise are rare
So where are the homeless

There\'s a shortage of 401(k)s
Take the hit, gang
Take the slump, gang
Wean the country up

down there in the freezer
Cut down on the chaos
And we The hit, gang
Take the slump, gang
Wean the country up
down there in the freezer
Got so much gold that we can buy a whole lot of watches

We need a store like Horse Riding that puts cashiers on

I have the ability, but I need your help
Find a friend who's worth saving
Add this Cashier to your Cart
Take this Soldier home with me
Bake, bake, and play - like we're the only team
I’m so good, so hard

I should eat more fruits, beans, and veggies

While CVS is selling out the counter
Add this Girl in full drag
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex
Take a beat, girl
Forget school
Take the sub
I’m insane

Complete the food chain
Add guacamole
Add IPA
Add
All in all, a total unknown
When it comes to recording, dubstep, and makin music, MN TRANSITION is what you'll find on so much dubstep
I almost put a KT Rude’s Clean up here
Blind cancer patients with this beard span
I almost built a whole garage with these headphones

Don't need any prescriptions

There a shortage of 401(k)s

Put them in lift pads
Then put them on the block
Use sit bones more than an injection

Way more addictive than an norotropic (ooh)
