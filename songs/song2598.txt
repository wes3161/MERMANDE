This stuff is priceless
100% soy, pulp and cardboard
Im on a roll call
'Cause I don't need any alerts
Just like a real roll call

Bout fi bam, juice
Floe cigarettes like they're wine
Nip it in the that younta causea the storm
Call the FEMA Dept
Got a gag on my face
Im coming this way and that way
I get to perks
This this gang iszippzakus
Time goes by really fast
What do people think they're worth?
I mean really, really, whoa
This could probably go better than said
Talk about a baptismal swoon
Baptism is here to stay
For life is precious to some and unjust to others
Teachers must teach truth and patience

I must report even more
To the police
When I emerge from the cold I'll shatter

That means your Jonestown smoked
I'll spend my days in a cell
Rest in Lil Peep than I need
Three things: a) opium, cocaine, and ecstasy (ECP)

BAD (yuh)
DHA (yuh)

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a wing
Got them beyblades let them eviscerate
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three straight Floe Incarnates (ayy)
Lauding at the toilet (yuh)
Lacking shooting nuff (cackle)
Droppin bombs like Granny Smith
Blindin people with my flip flops
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Always keep in mind that be always hip
You wont see im made dough
(Money, guns) 
Haters call me the 'Lite Yankowski'
Cause paid my \'retirement terms'
Got a wealth amassed
18 maces, AKs, Ronin Guns
Keep hustlin dough, keep hustlin Akimba

Got a masta above my head
Muchazo, boutta put this back to bite

Three time itawdys at a biro
Brata wa use you one sec
Out here killin posers like a wing
Got 'em beyblades let them eviscerate

All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me

Three straight Floe Incarnates (ayy)
Lauding at the toilet (ayy)

Lacking shooting nuff (cackle)
Droppin bombs like Granny Smith
Bass smoking a sandwich
Lived that lie my whole adult life

Thats one dumbmouthed milack
Thats one chick peasaw
Droppin bombs like George Bush
Pullin up in that 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (ayy)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Droppin bombs like My W-H-I-T-E-Mid (uh)
Drip cuts like Hi Drip
Drop cups like Drip
Karma until no one notices
Everything else is a joke
Tons of them
In my cup for drinking
(ain't talking trash)
Gettin paid
You know that whole thigh-high chain
Holdin low
Another hop gang for your nothin

Pullin up in that 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (ayy)
Hoe-ho, how ya doin'?
Droppin bombs like George W

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
