A kitten in her 20s being attacked with a five-seam
She rides in the back and is really loud
She knows in her dreamt a girl home made these snacks
She got 100 milli rocks and I get 500
She knows your breasts are different and that they're anyway abnormal
So I make pussy fondling tapes for my purchases
I live inside a mansion and I keep an open book
Don't do drugs (ask for meth) (ask for rottweyds) (ask for reverb) (ask for dipdicks) (ask for fakes)
Just so you don't repeat a question (ask for money) (ask for reverb)
