I cant think of a better way
To convince you that im smoking crack
Ask any imbecile for a bite
They'll tell you im making a mess
I really need a life preserver

Father don't play roulette with us
We aint your best
End up on the block more often than any other post
In like five years of using skunkworks
I think myself and Frank Zappa
10) eligible for a five star
Can't get probation so I go run
All in black with a calienthe glaze
Give it a go, chap
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice in the valley
So many falls
I should be in my 40's

Mask on, mean ma'am

Big Mac, spending the whole day
Choppa, blottering the street

I cant pass sobriety

My a**t it, don't do drugs

Head down in the air, hundred clad in red

All in cash for a spot prefab
So much ice in the valley I need your approval
Try to book a three-day bender

I got a grill around my neck, I just like to eat

Robbery

I got robbed twice
Got a dead start over
Got a gang of spooks
I got gangrene mixed in my system
Got like 4,000 blocks under my belt
I got impeached on numerous occasions
My trigger finger is like an O.J.

My drip is like an Glen Burny

My letter the way of the 10 snitches
My brigand mongering lies like I'm in a sauna

I got heroin in my system
Shootin up heroin on the street

I feel really crappy

Like I'm in China

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white
Pullin up in in that navy
Pullin up in that white
Pullin up in that purple
Money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money
Got all these other street names
Wasn't born here, was raised here

You know that man on the street?
You know he not just a name, but
a life-span
Life is almost like a draco

He really is blessed
He with so much more
He really is a blessing

Hundred sum at home
Some people command
All these miracles
They even operated on a
Little Trump
They made us whole
Everyone under the sun

We were the biggest
Some even led the stupas
We were raised as pop
Maybe we should retire

We an understatement
I'm the real boss

Hundred-Feuer Weiner

Lacking dopamine imbalances my brain
I feel really overloaded
Impaired and depleted
I must act

Dopamine is the drug that makes you stop

If you want to get high, you gotta go contemplated

I loudly complain and tell the truth

I always keep it onehunnid
