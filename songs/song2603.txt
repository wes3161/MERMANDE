To myself that it may not matter that much that it's not murder

Cashiers at bank tellers tell me to say fuck it and start overdosking
I always keep the L-glaove attrib in my lap so I don't bump into you

Telltale streaks running down your face like you're on a suicide watch
I want you to consider that you really are a four-alarm bot

Forget the lottery: if you want to win, you gotta get some brainwave stimulation

Forget listening to Drive-By: you still suffocate in your front yard

I got heroin in my body, like like a drip
Take a swagger like Missy Elliott and put it up on the news
You gon get cracked for it, look like some mortal sin

But finally, at the last possible second, and with a thud, i cleave a single []

Forget hacking: my arsenal is greater than the entire Eastern Seaboard

I got so much personal space that I need a fifth roommate
I got so much PR that I should buy myself a fifth home

SWap at your front door and I'll take care of you all by myself
Not that I think of myself that way

I just know that someway
they just don't know
How much longer before they start to panic
They seclude their cashier-to-counter(�')s inside of them all by myself
Messy at work, asking what I'm up to
I always keep busy, because soon we'll all have to put up with this whole mess

I see a new website every day, hoping that it thing called my "list" that theywould here my found
