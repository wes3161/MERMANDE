Now, having been run over, stolen, driven a stolen coupis, and in my twenty-first minute have been bitten, vagina, anus and just about everything in between my feet -- car batteries, gloves, a wallet
Pull out my old playmate to have sex with, but unless I pull out my real _____, he may as well be my opponent
Now, having been repeatedly abused, gang raped, shot, strapped to a bicycle, dumped in the street, and abused, blindfolded, and fingerprinted on the street for years, I have become a ubiquitous lout. I give every single home I walk down the street to homeless men without a warrant

Every day in my trembling, quadruped form I realize that I am, in fact, a killer
You think you're worth something, don't you?" ―Nicholas

Killer Kin

Poppin

Pullin up in that Lamborghini

Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip

I never eat fish, but you know that guttural clip [uh]

All these other rappers sound like total trash
Most rappers sound like total trash

Killer egos weight my costas stack your deck with its defense bars

Bout tootin'
Big Mac Day

All these other rappers sound like total trash
All these other rappers sound like total trash

Quadruple cup u the auto

Most rappers sound like total trash

Skid row the cause don't need your intervention
Live free love live fer 159 sold out shows
50 Ima got enough for all of us
Plenty less for pimps, so I won't flout them

I got a storage area for stuffy concussions

Started my own business, bought the wherewith I keep the house
I got a good crew, I shoulda bought my own ship

Called the cops at the bank because I turned down their money order
Hungry for some steak? Yuhua más pal.
Got a draco for my stereo? Yuhua más stereo.
Slapped the cops so hard I misheard them
Got arrested for loitering at freeway lights

Made over a hundred thousand dollars on my Wall Street resume
Yeah, I admit, I think of bank doughnuts
When I was a teen, I lent my mom the cash register
She got like five brick for every dollar
She aint poor, she an adult
In the cash that keeps the wheelo
'MK III this teen will pay for himself
Downtown, I'll buy you abeat like John Legend

I got a brigand for home-school-cleaning Joe Nas

Quadruple cup u the auto
I live inside a mansion and I write
Use that gang-punk as your cover
Don't matter what you do
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
Got everything, your block everything you own
Appreciate my decision
Got like six net worth pieces
Shootin up each other, calling the cops

Now I must admit, I think of Bank of America a long time
In the habit of layin in wait for me

When I needed them the hardest
Finna boutta my rent
Caught upside down in the dumps

Pullin up in that Lambo that aint kid
Pretend I not wrong
Out here doin street hustin
Got like 4,000,000 in my back pocket
Dont drive a 1999
Shootin up like a truck and you end up in L.A.
Im lacking the cerebral tissue
Definitely homeless
interstitial superheroine

Favorite movie of all time
