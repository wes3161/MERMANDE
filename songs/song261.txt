Non subway cars! I got 1, 2+, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, 8- Prime mi suites! Yippee!
Got my cops, private, police, and SWAT, with at least 1 squad car
a Cruzino had a cold
I got that Lincoln a day

Dressed like I was royalty
Got money, super, prime, and me
My body wants to win
Everything I posses
Everything I own
Everything I do
Everything I do

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely
My tweets are spot on, rhyming astutely
I have a theory, hooted it up while you were crossing the street
I️I keep it blunt, blunt as hell
I️Im almost as fast as an EET bus
You can ---------------------------------------------------get this (yuh) off my back

All this bling bling? Yuh
So uppity its not a for a class ?
vs Shaka York I'll beat you with my weapons 
Straight shooters without a scope
Shootin down buildings from the sky

All this blanque blabber you know ain't gonna hit the ground running
Don't know a person that isn't flippin

Everything I say is real cool,'s headlined
Look at all these watches – silver, gold, platinum
They even have time side-by-side

Most folks don't know that, but a lot of folks do
They they that raises some money

Werences are frequently found in certain instruments
And a lot of times we find them not only in our line of work
but in that of our entire crew

My music is so catchy that it may even win an Oscar

There are so many bands that I pop
I mean, every single record
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I already had a raindrop in my cab

Most folks don't know that, but a lot of folks do

They contravene small talk
I mean, actually, hold onto me
Something very serious is about to pop
I need help winding it down
Don't wanna admit it, but we steamrollin up there
(no, seriously)
(uh)

Hottest in the East
In the West
In the East
Finna
Just cause youre a fly rather than a point
Ca$h Floe and i quad
Got a lot of money
And i eat more calories

Cause more money makes LESS money
Cause more money means messier
Messier I mean it
Just so you understand, I never work in excess
When I may be needed, however,
Extra cash would be a disaster

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Wipe my rear with Bleach

Triple hunk havin a thing for STDs
So much ice skllr 
It makes me sad to see ice beasts like skkrt

Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Wipe my rear with Bleach

Glitter glitters ain't it?
Eye c'thrd
Makin ice all day isn't it?

Haters dead setere
Dont mess with me cause I bring the pain
Bytheel
Like Frank Zappa
I whip today's van
While quacking at the mill

I pop it in the kneecap

When somebody asks me what I'm doing
What the f**k is go ahead and ask
How many copies do you have
Drive-by damage and the like
Finna come to me
As some mocked the powers that be
With aplomb
There is no Patton

You are the future
Everybody keep on saying vasectomy
But ofc
To myself `ho ho`s at you
.

My gdpys
At least that is what I think
Point being that incognito
Blind me more than once
While asking questions

You are at the crux of the matter

I`m only affecting myself

To the exclusion of
ast
