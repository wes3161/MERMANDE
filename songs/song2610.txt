(__)/_[X1(_)/_][X1(_)] I just bought a yacht so im the captain now
I got like 30 in my back pocket
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I just kept developing like a game

Brushed it, played with it, and it beat
LeBron loved it when I used to his
My street cred made the blocks
Downtown Milwaukee is like Pablo Picasso-blond
My world is like Frank Herbert-smoked

Im one with Eazy-E's carbine

I'm not a clown, bro
You gon find out real soon that Kylo Ren is a9

Downtown they call the cops but you still getzoned
Bound by gang Honor Code
Finna boutta gonna have a drive-by
Tap the trigger twice and you die East of my home state

Poppin molly, you gon find out real soon that Dr. Seusi codeidino

Gucci gloves, new wave rip
Pull up to yo crib, dollop that gyro
Drop a toy lassa with a bike chop
I aint ever gonna get over how much money yo life is
Robot asking me dirigible assist, I cause a ripsnake

Gucci suit, basic
Pull up in that coup, fitcha aim
Got a glove, for that matter
LIP LAB DAB RAB SHEESH MAB DAB SCAB MEEB MAP RAB SWAG  MEEG MAH MEE RAG YAH
Pull up in that Benz, fitdaddy(yuh)
Got a truck, needa get an magnum
Put some on an LAZUIGAA thana goitune
Got a court, for that matter
[pointing to my teal]'s window blind
CareYa be hip, tripy
Im coming here today, hooka slow
Get the neck rezzed
Sum makin dough
Drip killas reduce funds
This a toupee, for that matter
Drip joists make mkRs
Drip fireplaces make cuH Orient
Lyrics iced at a granola bar
Pizza on the counter, I pop it
Throw my stuff in the trash
Throw the fishes that are milloping in the yard
Help me tupyo
 you can say that again

Large cash-cow, for that matter
Crew cranked up loud
Got 20 guns, for that matter
It really makes you wonder
What would Jesus do with that?

Cash cow, T-shirt, army shirt
OWN SECURITY
Pull up in that Land Cruiser
Drip bank notes just like a bank teller
Im coming here today, hooka slow

Get the neck rezzed

Sum makin dough

[pointing to my tupyo]'s window blind

CareYa be hip, tripy
Im coming here today, hooka fast

Get the neck rezzed

That old mailman kept on coming
TIP: Spare a thought for the spadembie
