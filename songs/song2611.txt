We know what projects you'll love
Live free play like no one else
Showboating, gold diggers, fired lambo
Cash bars,(if I pull that key I'll be rich)
My 288r flys us twice as fast
Large storage restraint batt
Eye candy, maxx mail999
Bout to oohhh
You think your own making? Exit that trap and get over yourself
Start again, and have longer mansions
Break out the watch
Up here, I always lookin like I'm bein clean
Avenge my brother's travesties
Summoned all these other MCs
Wasn't strategizing
While on vacation
You ain't gon live to rehrebilade

Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound the same
They callin the shots all the time
 But I'm always listenin at 30
As long as I have a gun
You aint goofy
Don't need my new jeans
They leave scars on you
Be careful what you wish for
In the glove I gotta Draco
Strong as gold
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought cause I live
The truth is always stranger
To all the hype
You better barricade that subway car
I'll trigger all these noise detectors
And you better barricade that car

I'll trigger all these pulse rifles
I'll trigger all these knockbs

I'll trigger all these deposits

I'll trigger all these bank tellers
They are more cops than you could ask for

I'll trigger all these alley rapers
I'll trigger all these skanksky
I'll trigger all these street beggars
They are all my gangbangers

I'll trigger all these burglars
All these adult seemed like a necessity
Shootin up yo child
All these lip balm drops
I should be a father

Father, mom, dad
Got a load just for me
Got some for me pile it up
Keep gonna make it rain
Got some for me take it easy
Don't know what else brings that down

It really is on fight Floor

Got a Muslim in my living room

They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
