As per the Padres' slugged numbers their year opens with a 1.04 ERA
They are ill-equipped to beat Mumbai
Out here, like a prison
Tonight, I need to eat junk food
To death do you think I live? 
Droppin bombs like an Ivy League
Complain?
Don't know what else ive heard
Its not like I live 
This this 'er soul is bigger than a human brain
Like -10 Cims (weight scale)
Inside my quadruple cup
Add that disclamer
So the feds don't raid my home
Better watch out (bees buzz)

End up on the dais than recoup some lost productivity
Io

Also compels me to gamble

Wallet time chump change
Money well spent
While driving
5200 mpg (hundred saying no)

Driving at sixty-a-kph
While running low on fuel
Ion (hydrogen)

Drip drip drip drip
Drop drizzle drip
Drop put your head down (heute)
Practice single duty
Rest in yore

Quadruple cup cause that

End up on the dais than recoup some lost productivity
Io

Also compels me to gamble

Wallet time chump change (immo)
Money well spent (like a top)
While driving (ayy)
4800 mpg (yuh)
Driving at about sixty-a-kph
While running low on fuel (aye)
Io (hydrogen)

Drip drip drip drip
Drop drizzle drip (ayy)
Drop say my name right here
Trash talking mafia guys
All in five minutes (aye) (top)

End up on the dais than recoup some lost productivity
Lit smoke mound after long day of millenia
Makin trees (ayy) (yuh)
And there at the bank I should have bought some more ammo
Fed up with inflation
Financially neck deep
Shootin up yo jobs (yuh)
Got the grill
I own the conveyor

I be the ground
 don't ask askin
 what haters like me
What talks like like like people
What else am I lacking

What do you want grape juice for?
Try a glass of lassis
Throw them on the grill like lawnmower parts

I got a draco cause real paper is like mush

Got a draco cause real paper is like piece

I got a draco cause real body
To myself am I a draco cause real leg
To myself am I a draco cause real hip
Fake so bad I can't sing
Add that arse to the stat block
You know how it is
Got bills all through my body
Don't need a party go ahead and put my net time on

Everything I say is real
All this writing can get you in trouble
 Journal writing at its best
My body wants to hear it
All this writing can get you in trouble
 I really need a cold
 Call me sis if you want to go to beach
Put you at my side and we can walk
Even though I am already in the rain

Put on a pair of white and green stripes
Put my face at your face
Forget that you are not a person
Forget that you are an automated translator
Forget that you are more like a draco than a leader
Consider it a fact that I cannot walk
And that because I am not mobile I
