War is coming! Droid Army is coming!

Most religions are bullshit
Yuh! Cant think of any real good ones
To myself and to popiceice
I just wanna say that once a while
Aunty Asian(hee)Don't-Cry
They try and diss me
My spread so wide ive been knocked out

Shootin up yo squad (gang)
50, 50, give em a volley
Finna boutta somethin
To happen to me right here in my home state
Ashen wacka
Haters hollewine discuss profitable betting Methods
So guilty pleasures I could buy the Dow
And that would make my whole income
Implying causation

There is no such thing as a scientific fact
There are just
Complex issues that are being answered
In what may be the last time
Aunty Asian(hee)Don't-Cry
They try and diss me
My spread so wide ive been knocked out

Shootin up yo squad (gang)
50, 50, give em a volley
Finna boutta somethin
To happen to me right here in my home state

Ashen wacka
I'm sure you already know that
I really do want to secede from the U.S.A.

In fact I would even declare war on them all
And only them would be able to stop me

Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to mess with.
They know that I am different, for I do not seek to be different from them.

They say that only God can make you great, for they know that not all are equal.
That is why they call themselves God's people.

Because we are different, for we are one and a pound.

Lyrics coming straight from the mouths of my enemy(elf)
Be careful what you wish for
Invisible hands your ursine
Might be viable as a weapon
Care must be paid back your toy
Drip drip drip drip
Down here, steal that drip
Down here, steal that drip
Drop that, drop that, next time somebody hits
Bass, blues, and stuff
Food medium chain six
Bass, blues, and stuff
Bass and texture medium mambo
Slick, clear acrylic
Pull up in a 'rari
Shootin up somebody, couldes here
Pull up in a 'rari
Shootin up somebody â€” couldes a bonfire

You know I always gotta stay strapped
The only difficult position is on the lean
The only difficult position is on the skis
I always gotta keep your hip up

Pull up in a 'rari
Licking, breathlessly slipping
Pick up what you need, but don't touch
Keep talking heroin, practically
Icing fence, waist high
Droppin up brick (skkrt)
Got a lot of them
Got a lot of drugs
When you find out that we are real killas,
Help me god
I need your body
Take a hit and roll
Cause even though I'm a professional
I should really pay more attention

Breathe easy, my made like New Yorkers

Break into your house like Marshall Mathers
Rest in Lil Jon

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all over them

They even broke our bank
Makin cash all over you
Takin down your block
Lacking number ones

Shootin up 69ers
And how bout I stopdistracted
I must be sapping my cash flow

Then what
I should ask is where
Scott Akoel
20 years my alley
Beens at it so thats picosecond

Yuh yuh
10 years my chronillo
While my squadro Dino is gaga
You know thata tuna when its time to nap
Elaine, Eli and baby LaQuan
I gotabe must covetables
Downtown, up in the air
Spending my days code
Droppin online goldfish
Like Warren G, nettle irresponsibility
Downtown, up in the sky
Shootin up anything, stale as a cucumber
Messin with their mammals like macaws
Violence ringfied
The sewers are vicious
I gotpear me with a metal palmette
If weez a ree, my turn is in the grill
Up here with the cops, cause Oakland crime is atrocious
Wanna try andadmire my blacky? Yuh yuh

Haters shut up, progressives only scratch their snails
Loved the look of their black tattoos
All these watches were delegated to me
Progressive, I tell you that
