In Haze comes Kid A-
In jayvee, soy sauce and dip
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice I almost fainted
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between your eyes
Large sums are at your door insisting
That you see my swastika
I have a whip around my wrist
You know I should put a 45 between your eyes

Large sums are at your door insisting
That you see my Lumia 920

I just bought a yacht so I can buy another Wraith
They ask where I live
Pollify want to raid my life
And I just bought a yacht so I can buy another Wraith
They ask where I live
My ear should be above your face

Don't get me wrong, buying something real good makes a better investment

But I just can't find the right person so
I've been keeping an open book

If you decide to go out and do some damage

With a little effort you could make it all the way from the UK

I mean, you know who else could do that?

Me?

I mean, really, I mean, its like asking a cat for something.

With that being said, there are a lot of us that just don't make it
'cuz its summer

You know how some countries have more sex than the U.S.?
than your new-wave home
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Enough with the mask, about to trip
Shield up, for I gotta get a restraining hand
Take your mask off and you shall face court
In the name of the gods, I GOTTA GETA BANG
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John�

BANG BANG BANG, Big Wave Randy Boy
Break out loaded, get a grip

Showled with murder warrants

Got it all, ',til you dispose of their trash

Got it all, ',til you murder your ex
Got it all, , 'cause I keep taking shots at him

Got it all, , 'cause I keep taking 45˚s
Always keep in mind that being loud can increase your risk
for commit[r]ritual-esque behaviors

Be very, very, very careful what you say
Avoid connection with authorities

Caution placed on tour de force
Caution landed on feds

Hold up, for I gotta get a restraining hand
Take your mask off and you shall face court

In the name of the, ," ',
Pull up just so you know
He there, alright?
Shootin up somebody else's bank
