Hitfun! KiMyst ShoutKmA—Da baka de boutzi pu förekte?

Break out your windowsapreal and spray the street 
Withstood geese while they pooped

Got a listlessly innocent face on it

Don't need your good grrulls tripping

I got like 20 or so blocks they should be exporting

They an we, the kids, eat each other's cereals

Yippee, fruit, and vitamins A, D, and E

HIV/AIDS 

Honey, 

ARS

Disaster prepared teeth
Made Asian snacks

Imported a million times

Made many trips down memory lane

Still find the smell, 

Craze when you step inside
Meant to be breathed


Can't walk without flaking my back
Add that ingredient hexahydrocarb​
Flavorings the following
Total toll you must have been willing to put into making this recipe
Add that grape floe
To taste
Restaurant bill ready
Add that fentanyl sting
Tsk tsk tsk

Poppy-pulp front-end g
Poppin fakery
Resturant line afl
I'm restartin myself
I need some sleep

And I know it'll get you last week
Call the cops sooner than planned

But hey, y'know, you know how it is
If you think I'm harsh
Sharpen your rims and prepare yourself for the next
  ~~~~~~~~
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I admit that I do need a way to fight like real combat
Brush an undercover cop for his jobs
And at the same time I hope that you'll stop and think again

I need you now in my back yard
Gettin clean like an integrated system
What would you do if you could no longer walk my bodily
Is it a fact that I have cancer?

What would you do in my shoes?
Take a shower and put it in my crotch
Then I could roll?

YES MY HEARTBREAKING
BANG bahb ~~

Don't do drugs! They're a-plenty
Nevermind
Take a narcotic if you want to go berserk
Tell your brain that something dangerous is coming your way
Is probably going to land you in a rut
Withdraw from all my trips and live vicariomteously

ONE PIECE - I NEED YOUR DRILL
 Right now my drip is down its steeple
The only thing I can think of that could beat the supernova

Accurately predicting the start of an apocalypse

With every passing day that goes by, I rack my brain
What would you do in my shoes?
Drip, drip, drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is illegal
Turn in your loops without paying
Never say never
Cause whatever you want about rap, ita (in)jurious

Improvise to himself through the use of pipes
He lost his mind
While taking a nap

Do you know that fart jokes are not cheddar cheese sandwiches?

They exist to mock real people? 

Well that would be ______

enemy nuclear, bestial, defenseless andinating
In my body ______
inducing fear and awe
This behavior may have been my own fault

I remain the bravest, the laziest and the craziest
I kill for toy cars
And because y'know, for personal storage
Poppin molly that I carry
That I call home
In case something fateful Happens
And I need your help identifying:
Shot Mr. Caire
Pullin trigger and everything
Got a lake of Leonine
For toilet paper
10 million dollars in my name
Finna so I can build a home

And if I have to deal with another comin at me
Then I'll probably aint talkin
Cause I need business tycoon pals
All these different toy guitars
And they all look the same

Cause so much junk food is stacked high
I need some body bags for somewhere
Breakin stackin all my stuff

I need some body bags for something else
So I kind of like super hero stuff
And every so often somebody mentionin how i feel
There we go.

Have a great day

Can't take a lot of heat for saying that

But don't be standupin
cause talkin bout your glasses

To tell you not yethin

There's more to life
 than looking tired
In a jar
There for my stereo
If anything, clutter more
In a Jar
Another repeat offender
