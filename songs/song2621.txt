My radio goes flat and I die
 If I were a draco I don't own a sailing corporation

Haters dead like juggo at rims
Use me instead of Freya at end like,
Put my weight behind a more commercially viable cause
And more guns and magazines are on the street (I own the Peabody)

I should've been more aggressive (skkrt)
Instead I just have a straight forward song

Six years of incarceration made me a better person (yuh)

Fake DPS batshit commits mass murder (You never know)
