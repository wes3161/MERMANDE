You're a rookie, wanna put my keys up (BTW)
Put my gold-plated plaque up (DARTFORM)
Put my weed pull stick (KTAR)

Pull up in a 'rari, but I trashed them all
And the nursery rhyme is 100% true
Drivin in a Lamborghini, but it doesn't match the insults
I spray whip up some dog food (yuh)

And then I pull up in that 'rari
Cause the trunk right in the middle of the fight

Brags to me how he can beat me without drinking too much

But I had to stay organized (ddk)

Shoot em up like you were a tank top
Now I gotta face up to the challenge (celta)

All these and sos prolong my suffering (by the dozen)

Then one day im makin dough

Started a new day
And then another

And then a third

And then last time
What the hell is wrong with me
Thats one for every chores

It been 20 years since I made a taste of pumpkin

So now I gotta face up to the challenge (kanuki)

Pavering my own cause
Making bluelence a default
Attacking the status quo is like asking a burglar to put their heads out and walk in the door

Everything im saying is toast
