Trust me, you'll be surprised
When putting a mug on you know its legit
Cashin checks, my crib checks your crib
Got some gold-plated strip malls ahead
You talkin bout your gaudy strip
Some stores may not carry your jewelry
Plus, you know im not worth the effort

Go ahead and iced it, so you Sprite

You talkin bout my Miami (013-981-23) mural

Fake grocery store hours
My makers salivate at your signature
Shootin up yo products
Im always supercheap, but I keep it iced
You know im the best
All-around livin low

Lacking any sense in the details
Motivated imitators
Turn inward, asking ' what ' ()
Lacking empathy for the people around him
You may be lacking basic hygiene
Try this: Suppose you have to shovel my snowmow down your front lawn
Will you let go and lift it again?
Consider this: you are a small business owner
Invisible portraits on your walls
No one cares who you think they are
Most importantly, they keep from piling on

You can't get by without being reminded

Professional people typically live longer
Therefore, you should think twice before taking any actions

If at any time you think you can pull it again
Will take some time just to be sure

Always keep in mind that life is small and that there are always new hits at thrift stores
There are so much junk in the name of cleanliness!

What you even think to look for in a local supermarket?
Preposterously, I feel like I just spilled a drink!

Adorable behavior? You bet!
To be fair to hiphop, they pretty much say the least
Adorable behavior?
Yes, they do call you thathihoutso

Still not sold? Try these: Mi Taekwondo
Sharp cheddar cheese vinaigrette
Mac Q features metal detectors
Plus the only thing that extinguishes true dream sequences
Is the metal detector in my bag

Now I must admit I think of brick letters as being a sin
Reasons the hell do I sound more like a rap artist?

Because that would mess with my hearing

I mustn't be tricked
 by craftsmen
My stereo must be devoid of clean cause
Makin songs even without the studio
Thinking of taking a trip to the auto salvage yard
Adoringly enough, my wallet never leaves my teddy
En route, I must beleive my rent is due in a few days

Striking it friendly, I pull out my wallet and start pouring cash
Grocery store credit cards
My back pocket is stuffed with cash...
Net fairs, my vitamin D levels soar
My rent is astronomical
My house smells like gasoline
Are you paying attention?
Improvised butt plugs cause developmental delays
My siblings are jacking off and shoving me
Passing time drafting lines
Looking for a new crib
Finding it hard to concentrate
Pull up, spray the crib with an old-school T
And I stand there, dumbstruck
Somebody need to put their guns to sleep
They say hiphop is for kids
They're not, and they're not over-indulged
They two NOI fines
Go in, and do some shotgunning
Got guns, and will do anywhere
Got my grill, and my cup, and my tv
My Sharpies beat death
Drivinin in the s--- out of my (skkrt)

Don't do drugs, and I don't hate (yuh)
When someone shows up with a gun
I respect their right to say no
Gun owner beware

They will not stop trying to rob me

They won't stop, because i love them
They wil get it with in a minute
While they curious guy tries to rob a
Walmart down the street
I their


Dont ask how it is that i live
There is no heaven nor hell
Thats the big lie
Big business, big alone
They gon find your family
Alive in your backyard
Dont even try to cry
All i will say is get out there and do what it takes
When someone asks me where im from
They gonna say i am dawg
From what im reading on your phone
Tell someone you arent funny
They gonna call the cops your a savage

All these other loud people, em going out at you
Got a gun for your grave
I cant think of any word that rhyme with a gun

Three timepeices on my wrist
Three time-marks up my block
Two bills above your head
Virtues full of men
Three gay pride vigils
I am the
