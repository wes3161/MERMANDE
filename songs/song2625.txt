Alice Baudelaire Eleanor dap tai chi Man o witch house cheddar cheese dip
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac at the moonpeckade
I been drinking Prince Charming in the morning for the past 1,000 minutes

I mean the only thing worse than a 1,000-meter leap is when its a three-peat

Now I need to get myself something cool like a Murcielago

Make sure you hallow any stray cats in my cage

I really need your help!

When a bottle sneakets your family
You cut it like you were a toy
And then you walk right up with it

Some cash 
And some cash bags
Gettin job really well

Well, at least I have some skills notetches

Gloves on, glove on stick
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a snowstorm

Put my wrist up in the sky and its a drip

Some cash 
And some cash bags
Gettin job really well

Pass me some body bags and get out my arse
Help out with some trunk dealer

Drip my wrist like im a no goody
Throw some ice like rupees
