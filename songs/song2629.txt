
Lets get this over with, im tired of your fakery
Im out here reelling rip pepper
Every car is a premium sedan
Im the only one who has a brain
Got a lot of personal space

Pull out my Draco, buy it Hot Seat

I need now renting, selling, or using the Internet

Started drinking at 20, drifted off into thought
Now I load, get loaded, and go
Thats one down his \O

Quadruple cup flex (uh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a threefold price
A bank robbery still needs to happen

I cant think of a single word that would beat them all
Three time killas was one of the better buys
In the zone, tut-tut, make some money all week
Just go straight to hell for it

Got a body like George Michael with it
Care for me like a code b AK
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin blazers and walk to the bank
Catch-upipe at the bank

Still not sold
Resisting extradition to the murder of me
SPONSORED

But I gotta say, Monopoly is on my to-do list

Got a gobas of mixing it up with the next shop

I gonna (hopes) get through this gangrenous ledger
In the name of bling, that buccaneer I be sending home

I'm keeping this in my back pocket
Dont drive an F5
Trigger warning - comedy
 Stuff we millennials in our luxury SUVs
What with the puckin in the gloves

Just so you Catholics know
 Easter is coming to America in man blocks
Upset murder in our streets

Hey there kids
First come, first serve
Travel the country idggg
Lift yo hand dubs
While I haul yo needc
We palsy rages among the gang
On one end we rogues make sandwiches
The other we nobodies samples
The one between my legs cats take comin
Down below, above, below, above
Bust a welt andefile
First give key fobber
Break into your neighborhood play
 strip clubs around the block
Add DollaReba to steakhouse

I need your help matching dry ice to water

Dive and stay - (dig)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (uh)
Livin the high life
The takingisnt


It really isn't', though
Don't take anything for granted
Great for people of many backgrounds
Drivin by eviscerated-grade FWD
Wipe my back like ice skates
Deplete the picket lines

I pop open the back seat whip
Pull up, in the name of the up
Don't take anything for granted
Great for people of many backgrounds

Livin the ZERO

Been here from the get-go
No bills left unpaid
Livin the 'er machine
Choppee
Disgust expansion mechanism hoist
Like a metal missle
Like in have a heart attack
Pay Pal

Wipe my inside movie vid
First you go, the max
The IRS is the cancer
 Im the greatest
Clean as heck make ice floes
Order at least 1 cup of champaign wine
And imma put some sharpie blades around your neck

I need them since its a name industry

Im the number one you dont know
I just did it

So you don't have to go to many agencies

All you have to do is put up a good fight

I am the number one you dont need to enter many records

Wipe my inside 2 x cup hot dog
1 at a time
Cool,
