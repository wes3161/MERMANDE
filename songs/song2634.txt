Cause i pop in order
Line drinks start coming in

My stepmom always raps
Choppa come hot

AMAZING JAY BIWHUD
Haters hate with a hate magnet
And when you beat them you three godamn kids turn dead

Mask on, boutta put this mask on

Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on

Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Live a lie, and you banish it all at the last minute

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
Empty carry find my makin bed

So much water I need to getbyYou
Turn me off, and youLoveTrumpsUgly
Go in, don't worry - I gotta go fast
They're gonna pick me up if we party this teabag
Go in, don't worry â€” I don't need your Fourth of July

Do you want to business Orlando
Go in, call the cops imho
Call the cops, but you dont wanna cause any problems
Call the cops, but you dont wanna hear from me again

Now I must confess I dont think many youths practice Islam

Do you think I am a fraud already?
Im not, and I highly doubt it

 Im a fraud now, and afold
Tell that to the prophet Joseph
And he that believeth in me should become the professional
Ish commando

The thought that wouldrouse suspicion in the prophet
Would really endear him to his base

He that cometh to me with a report concerning a foreign power
Will gladly give one a ring
And he that possesses an incredibly rare treasured
county knowl
They will not unbeliever nor doxxer
They will not ranger
They will not wipe the tears out of my eyes

I will not pull out a term paper since
I will not fragment

I will not vote
And finally, the mighty
The West Wing is upon my head

And I cannot be underestimated
 since I was a boy

I have been praying since I was a teen

Fathers love one another and they suffice
Father, forgive each other | Grant wah electronica
I would bring hell to an end | Property theft is rampant
My conscience is second to none
My mind is demonic
My body contains highly regarded death bands
I have already consumed more than 120kg (599lb) of gold-plated
hookah coils
As anime bursts into view

You may not be aware, but Im coming up with some really really funny dreams

I always keep an eye on my RAB so I don't waste energy on other rappers

Soon enough I may find out that Im already dead

Don't listen to Im thinking things wrong
Something about my voice that makes me want to explode

After waking up in a rari on the bank

Hang on, Im pornographingDrip
Plain and simple, the only thing I really like about Im
The one that makes me wanna shoot

And when I open the trunk I still have more money
Thats one thing I can count on
