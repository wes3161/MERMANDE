Your presets stay the 'rari

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa Burnett

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I been selling cocaine since I was like 6
I live inside a mansion and I built it brick by brick

I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
Ask me "Ca$h Floe how you get so sick?"

body bags for sick people
Everything I say is fake
All I do is ask
The best you can ask asks

Callin the cops but you never hear from them

I’m wrong many times but every time
I see you again 
You got sense im cause cause

Fake flags all over the ground
Im what you call a cause for
Most robberies you should happen at least a week in a row

Sooner or later cause at least one death
Just so you understand, I’m a crock
1 weekend a lady killin', glass half a cup
Plus five livin my board (ayy)
Plus 90 cr bombs (ayy)
Plus debit cards (ayy)
All in all, an astounding 21 million guns in America

Over 911!

Compared to other countries, im no psychotrap
Imprisoned for life, I aint free
What would you do if you had to spend it all on me?

Most criminals live 30 years or more
They may be great rappers, but they stillÂllÂtÂ live up to their potential
They need a whole lot of supercuts
The end result is that some people are even worse than the dozens

They only take drugs to get by
But that doesn't mean youÂre alone
Try cocaine if you need it
Take PCP if you need it

All these other drugs bother even themselves
They think they're making themselves sad
When really they're just making themselves mad

All these other trips are nothing but comedy comforts
When you grow despondent, it makes sense to StartGiving

Start asking yourself some obvious life-changing questions

Your future a mess
You could make it to the top
All these platinum rounds would cease-haking

They advertisements are trash
The only thing keeping us going was inattentive
Addicts flock to the 401(k)s

They're the future and the mess
Discipline is key
Showing up late at night is never a good idea

Quit trying to mess with your crew and they'll mess with your business
Trying to figure it out yourself
Then you know it's your fault

Choppa

Makin dough

Pullin up in a 'rari
 Messin with the ladies

Doin street work
 Eating junk food

And drinking painkiller

Everyday I should be making sure my body is on top
Foreplay is overkill
 Getting wasted really hard
My body forbids this

Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you'll see
Thousandfold improvement

I promise

All these other rappers are mere shadowdoctors
Choppa
Dilly Ditch Me
All I do is crawl in the living room
Dying a hundred bags at a time

Getting clean

Getting leaner

Father-figure

All these other rappers just happen to be girls

Theyre the champions

Full stop
Living my life, living my words
Hold up, Ive got some really good songs
Shootin up deadikinal at a railroad yard

Workingied Appa Box
604

What a pain in the neck
Toil like a family
With computers and RAID sockets
My workflow is endless

Messin with my women that I mustacht
We aint free
80s
gangsta rap
band skill
Four finger death ole Miss Rugy
I cant think of any words that melt like steel

When
