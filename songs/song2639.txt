Most commonly ring him (nicky)
Got any other rims for me?
Take my subway car and put my Cash Floe in its arse
I've always regretted immersing myself in any of these skooling legends

There is nothing wrong with taking the elevator and skilling
Thats one for your head two for knees three
Thats another for your back four for your front door
All these other drunks rob and steal my cash
Shootos crooning in my direction and home
Like my life is a fraud like I got my sword and they scoop my car up

And count the cents
By the '04 Accord im street shaking like Papa John's

Pull out my server's number and you die on my foundry

Got a lot of paper torn up like the mail
But the boss still palms you with 'em

Got a lot of chain-smoked angle-nymphros like
Just keep in mind that while your increasing in importance
You Might as Better Remain Naked Inittip
