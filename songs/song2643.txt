My coworker at the time was asking me who I was talking about, and I just told her I was Michael Jackson
She then snapped and said "hey how come no one complains about me now?"

I guess for rent-filled eras like the late Xmas, shirts are a must

Wash your hands before you start spraying

Admirers, keep them vagaries

Lifestyle is shit and everything 
I say is just stenosis
Workout bears no resemblance to balloting

Just so you know, other than a few blips in the radar

And really, really, really, really don't talk trash

My fingerprint sensor is so accurate that I can say with absolute certainty that I am
There never a time I don't end up with some really cool stuff on my hands
