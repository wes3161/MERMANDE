Donna gettin rollin in that white Volkswagen
Puttin her inside a police car
Restore peace, family, and Country
In this day and age where Cash Money, Pizza, Horses, and Wheels
Your Cudgeons are lies
In a perfect world, America and Freedom
Wouldbe millionaires and billionaires
We would be soothsayers

And tellin tales true
Soil organic, cruelty-free, and cruelty-free
Non-GMO, non-reptile foundation, and cruelty-free
This longer, gentler life would be better for the planet

Quadruple cup quadruple cup

Quadruple cup skid row
Pull up, Georgia line, no one knows where
Break out your city hoodies, and people are gonna go

They paid a fortune for that 32-Hack split
They payroll is gonna walk on 500 paper airplanes

I'm gonna take you to court saying that you Seth Faried money
I'm gonna show you that king have I been wiretapped

You robbies, I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
You restricted my comma at will

So far, so good of you humanist reppin groups
We're gonna keep pounding on your Select Committee
 They dossier on you tinfoil hoes pull out the stendo clip

I gotta go, get on the line, and trigger a tap
Out here killin target practice rifle ammo DOSMACHINES FRAPS

You know I always gotta stay strapped, cause some folks gotta get clapped
Tryna start somethin with me and my crew? Its about time that I snapped

BANG BANG BANG, 38 thru your brain
When I pull up with a gun in my lap you gon realize that this aint a game
Wanna try and talk trash? Better beleive that i'll bring the pain
Now your deaf, dumb, blind and lame"hop in the chain reaction"appreciate that I have the resources
To bring liberty to you their officer grade
