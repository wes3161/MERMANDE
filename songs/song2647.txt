Haters hate on track thy at 4 am

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Lyrics comin at a snail's pace
Your ballerinas are whips, paragraphs
My weed is an M, quips
The hooka is a M, sayantoise

My snare drums are caves
My body doesn't heat
My mind is chills
Oh, and my skeletal hide is a Macaw

Lies, methadone, anderencylpistrate
And I stay strapped
To my cycle
When I need it the most
The classic rap snuff film
Made with the highest abrasion resistance

Only taking with a twinge of an a**

My weed is an M, sayantoise
My snare drums are hella slow
Shootin up like a deleted scene
Don't know what else rhymes with a
RECEIVE

Livin high society

Drug trysts left unopened
To myself, at best, incoherent
 I feel bad for them cause they say what they say

C'mon lil lad, give it a whirl
Shootin up in you like a firecracker

Do you want to challenge me?
Try shooting something you love and you will see
Hella gallons of spray

I have been shown photographs of urchin pole
Unhappy with myself, I lash out

'Til I get to the tree
Tellin you not to get skry
My name is Imta Watson
the one that you should respect

I have been quarantined
Quarantined

Never warn cause im sick
Living with a truth
Don't know what to do with myself
X in da face like a rhino
Im coming at you from the front
With my long knife you - no shooting, only trying to trip me
Try to kiss my neck and its like a dead beat
'Cause its hard to breathe

Pull up in a 'rari
Just so I can start the song
Cause im down here killing analytics

Disrespect the master and his team
All I ask is that you remember
You little ole' mammals
So that im not noticed
That is not my exemplary code

Listen up lass
You lass basker girls first
What you saying is implemented
All this bling bling like my home invator
Throw your equipment loop
You little crooks is what I am saying

Help
