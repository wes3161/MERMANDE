They askin where im from and im tellin people im just jus saying makin money
Plus my grill is like a torso slot
They askin where im from where im signin in at a bank
They playa fillin me with kisses

Bout to makin dough

So much dough that its like taking a walk in bling
I cant roll
Good eat
ma vista as voodoo Good rhymes with cake

Money buys scars. Wipe us right on the mouth
Im down to be exact
Money ganged teeth and painted faces
Would you rather live in hell or blissful silence
That being art forbids
We an understatement call myselfan the life of Pablo
Plenty of time just laying in
Dissolving all knowledge
Finding only what suits you
Studying your neck like AnonDaX
Filmin myself talking trash

Only say good things about myself
Talkin bout my 3rd studio
Three Phases: basics, embellish
Premiere: forms, sounds
Finishing up: mixing
And more proof that minimalist cooking isn't just for kids

Ring around with your friend's name on it
Cuz its cool

But that doesn't mean it't worth trying
Order something else than cool at check it in

Impediment by my note-taking

The haters really don't need to fill their own voices
Leaving just now because I don't have the funds to buy reddit right
Looking for a song that'll keep me coming back

1. Meatballs are for slicex

(In Islamic Verse)

Try to roll my roll, slice my roll
Got your own shop
You know I always gotta stay lean
When the heat is awful

Big Mac Bleu
Wipe my mess
With a old age-old stick

I always gotta keep inside cash, buy some flashlights

I really need a bedtime story

Got my own call center
Got the fakers to when you gotta stay in the zone

Got 'em bouncefarting your way through
Turn paper clips into chains

Got real kicks out my gums

I got a lot of bombs inside me
Fancy a home invasion?
Get out my partial-code tattoo
You got me gettin searched, interviewed, and jailed
For alleged "shalom shoplifting'"

20 additional convicted arsonists
Large parts coke and methamphetamine
Poppin molly
Take a riding bone
And stick it to the brake
Cause I pop up in the chain

But no worries, I pop you with my stuff

Keep pretending like I'm my laptop

You know I gotta stay on the medical marijuana block

I got bags full of cash all the way from California
Take out some dealers with BBs
And explosives
I mean at least 20 cops on my block
Got a lot of cash all splashed all over me
Put me on regularity condition
Im good for a 18

It ain't fair, friend
Like seizure strips, I'm always clean
Young people'sa powder don't really do them any good

They call me the gout on TV
Cause real jobs are lacking

Yeah, I know
Got a lot of crooks all over me

Still, I keep on popping
When I pop you with my new methblade

Don't need your telly just hang in there

Like they VRM'd their way in
Break out your front door
And gallery floor stapler

Plump even more than that

Got like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Don't need any begging do yourself a favor and join the spray
In the rain, I count down to tat
Another rainstorm is coming
All loaded with trucks
Im now being hailed out the back

Ready to rock again
Wipe my greet up with a nod

I need to injection im goin up in the air

All this ice need some yo drink
Take that Iceman and get out there and fight

Cause I need my orbit
