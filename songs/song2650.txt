Put that mask on, mask on cover
Mask on, shit start I RTL
Pull up in a 'rari, asking for your autograph
Got my arm around you like a five-day pilot
Got a grill like a Gilded Age

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers sick
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz
Then I pull up in the rari
With my shooters you'll be sorry

My armory, expansive
My catapult aint passive
Tha barret is be massive
My draco is jurassic

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Lipity loppity
momidy robbity
 tongue so floppity
hippity hoppity
 Me llama you a comedy
IQ bring homogeny
 words long verbosity
Looking for a mamatree
Got five doggie -ees
Made 100 milli Gs
Got cash floe reppin T’s
My hoe got sum lean
My body wants to pee
Leaking the 6 seas
urine smells like codeine
Really bad hygiene
To myself im real mean
I hate the rap scene
Fake rappers have become pop songs

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers sick
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz
Then I pull up in the rari

With my shooters you'll be sorry

My armory, expansive
My Balloon Fiesta Jackson 4 Piste
Pump it with a gold stapp (cant trigger finger not a thing)
Put something purple on top
Put duct tape over your windows
I should make some mini-bricks (anthem)

I just bought a new body (yuh)

So far so good
The last song I listened to was "Where Are Ü Floppin" (yuh)
I'm always super mean
Been here from the start no one knows you exist

Directing my head at the top of my lungs is weird

In the shower I spray fragrances
You know they meander my every step
Searching for my guilty pleasures
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Chimpanzee, I clean you up

I always keep it onehunnid

Good thing you aint giving

Don't rap if you have a need
Wanna try some molly?
Try sending an email to me at graham
I really appreciate your think, antimook
I'm always super mean
Been here from the start no one knows you exist

Directing my head at the top of my lungs is weird

In the shower I spray fragrances
YOU CAN REMEMBER MECKABIT

In the shower I spray fragrances
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)

Xanax and molly (yuh)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Xanax blazin up front
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and lean (ka5ayy)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
