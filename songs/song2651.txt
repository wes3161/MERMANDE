Ice drinking days, professor
When his truck's full, Phil wins
Shootin up like every bozo
And I aint cheap, a gatherer
I own this world, my day
The whispers are your oyster
Don't need a prescription, just wanna know
What you really believe
Speak plainly and you'll believe me
You're not supposed to stay on the news, DOA
Method walk, subway car chug
Do I have to touch you? msglass

Go in choppin at the trash can
Theres nothing better than to roll
Go in at the airport, askito
I've been selling cocaine since I was like 6

I live inside a mansion and I built it brick by brick

I need a life preserver cause im about to slip

Death to the ghostly shapes around my home
All my movies are now free on this iPod
Drive a Lamborghini and its the selling price
I continue to this day
 Play pop songs all day
Even though they may not seem like pop
I still make more money than some guy in his forties
I just need some life preserver

So when the storm beats, I'll send them straight to my house

I'm open for business, cause even fresh someones ashes

Lipity lo trepidation at the thought
Advocates life as we know it, citing the Declaration
But I have to remind myself that we all make mistakes
Even in the face of my creative potential

I do my best to be empathetic but I cannot always be objective

My voice hovers above its weight and I can almost hear it clattering
All this while taking in the sights
What an effort to imagine

Life is boring now, can't possibly be more miserable

I know you're waiting for me, but I must pass through the next village
