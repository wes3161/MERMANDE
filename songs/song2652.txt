All these headphones meandered through my head
Trash talking like he was a war hero
But when I ask you a simple question like "What the hell are you talking about?"
You respond with truth
As a teenagerI always bought headphones for conference callers
They sounded good but sounded weird
 I am now 70 years old and can now listen to only two tracks

So now I start buying bass loops
They are making me sicker and sicker
I need to listen to some new rock ‑
sound!
