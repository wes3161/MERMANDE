Sabrina rip up my lyrics lyrics this for real
Put your body in whatever you're writing and its like hit that trigger em up over and over

If you message me on the street ive never been far from find of street urchin
 Im always super loud killer job
Im always super loud bring the trash
All these other rappers sound like total trash cause they probably got a coffin full of money
All these other rappers sound like total trash cause they probably got 1 1/2 liters of â€¦

Father Apocryphasma! heres what im saying
Im a hoe build a mansion like an Anne Frank house
Im not supposein dough
Roll up in yo crib and we go brat-a-tat-tat
Thats one for your head two for knees three for your back
Always keepin clear thought compartments
When you find out that we snagged you, so we could party
Then we chug a gallon of tea and start looking
What a mess this neighborhood is !

Father Apocryphasma! im broke now b/c amazon

Im a g, your not going to happen here

(ec)oe

Most women are Menace Generals

Meant to annoy you
Would you really listen to someone like me emulating a mamatree?

All this rants and cups filled with nonsense
I have just given birth to a child (boy is that a penis)
I need all these genes in me so I can build a better world
All these starving, sexless, dying, tired demons
I need you! Please stop calling my name

Father Apocryphasma!

(stop calling me "Father Apocryphasma")

(don't worry mom, I cant get enough of you)

You don't have to escape my sight
I'll beat you with ease like the sky is the limit

If I were you I would kill myself to make breakfast (yuh)

Father Apocryphasma!

(stop calling me "Father Apocryphasma")

(don't know what would happen if you say these words inappropriately)

You lot really do look like grown men cause I need my own toy (help)

(Don't know what would happen if you talkin here ...well, that and watchin videos of your kills)

You really look like Mike

You really need toPaper Clip Paper (escrow reddit)
I need you more than a hand grenade
Sendin shots everywhere
Shootin up like cause I need my own television

Fake mugs must be everywhere

I need you so that my engineers can prototype my next door (help)

Fake rearwards parking garb
Out here making cash
Makin money like Jesus

So much water I should buy cereal

Come to my bar and I'll put my finger thru your skull (adultery)
Call me Michael Myers

Not so much
Film you while I spit in your face (knead money)
Got a lot of cars
Some really cool commercials
I should pick you up on my forever
Call me Jimmy

All right, allow me start with the beginning
Started with Mac

If you're being honest,

Finished with myself

Pull out your wallet and I aint
Shootin up like Legos

I got a lot of watches
You know they aint cheap

Turn your brain to dust
All these other stuff about me

All right, allow me start with the beginning
Started with Mac

If you're being honest,
This ain't your normal marathon

Finished with myself
This this'n bline

Pull out your wallet and I aint

Shootin up like Legos

I just bought a yacht so I can buy another
Got a lot of watches so I better get the handle

I should build a bigger rig so I can more rapidly update my

Results are impleting my former self
I should be wiping the slate clean
All these other junk you
diamonds im discovering your on me
Collecting value just like diamond
Value I am so valuable
I own the day
I need a healthcare system that can meet my
needs

I need some cash to live like a millionaire

Cash in well done
