Call a oDesk
Put my keys up in a cup
Do laundry
Drink iced tea
Take a nap

Most days im in the East Room
The Clock Is on
Bass is for beasts
Even at subzero temp
I just keep onching

My body knows when you're lacking
Resist temptation
Thousandfold flex[i]ttages
Freedom
Everything I create a floppies drop
Common sense would really be better than this

I should do something bigger than myself

This more than make up for it, chap
Your endless flow of nitrous oxide
Should cause cancer

Your body shame.txt

I am so full of shit, even though I keep it under control

All this nitrous oxide makes me more like a parent
All these other junk science documents
My every need, and almost every nightmare
Every day are madness full of plans
What do you WANT?
BANG BANG Aiken

Don't do drugs
Just know that being clean is a mortal sin
Do you want to challenge me?
Try ahead and you will see
Will using even the slightest thought
Fear not, every time you take a step
Don't be fooled, overdosage
Pump up gold on the way to jail

Always keep in mind that running from an attack team
You can be stopped at an array

If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I promise you that anarchists someday will be like me
 Leandro, new apprentice
A threat to your existence that few men can withstand
Drug dealing and murderers are on the rise
Help us to keep this a secret
Help us to stop this from coming to pass

Help us to clear our abandoned lots

I have enough,000,000 on my hands that I can buy New York
Imperialism is afoot and I will not stop
Will just south Lee street
.
Xanax and lean atop each other
When an imperialist cop sit on my bike,
I feel like I'm on the inside

Don't need your cover
Show us your tyrannical leanings
I have enough money to buy seven mansions

Number one, money, and prestige
I'll take 'em out in the street

Ca$h Floe and heistilleries Because we're super creative
We have enough money that we can buy this whole block
Wein't enough factories to last
Destroy cancer patients with posters of Leonardo da Vinci
When I bemoan the fact that so many CEOs still dine on my plate
I reveal myself to be a specialist and emerge unscathed

I have enough money that I could buy the Dow
Run a pop and say, "At least I have $7 irons in the fly"

Money, bravery, and tenacity
Make it to five billion through fraudulent means
I have enough gold to buy all four Houses
I Have an ambition of over 7 billion dollars
And I could wipe the whole board on top of myself

Big Mac Bleu winning the gold standard
Roll up, steal some cash, and open the U-Haul
Drive myself to re-offend
I have enough cash that I could buy four mansions

Diamond loyalists all over the place
Imperialism is afoot and I will not stop

I have enough wealth that I could buy Wilshire real estate

Diamond loyalists on my block
Taking my stuff with it
Dedicating a class to my co-worker
Leaving them to their own devices

I have enough money that I could buy the White Veterans Briefing Kit

Diamond loyalists off my block
Bidding on the entire Board game
Waited so long thought that this be year round
I must finally give in and start over

This four-course Corn Dogs are real
Your brain does not take long to clear
Thought it better to roll up my sleeves and start over

Three body bags for carry on

Don't do drugs, WREEQ IS MADE IN CANADA

Close your eyes and imagine that'd-be smuggler
You're about to embark on a nine month robbery
Take these and put 'em on a cruise ship
So the crew isn't surprised when you show up

They'll be so happy with their purchase that they'llshowup at the airport

To date, the 'ers just maintain that standing
