Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Gettin paid like $5,000
Got a crew like Big Mac
You know how it is
When its snowing the sheet
A home invades
 rip the windows down
And my grill is spinin in

I getlled an eye for a watch
And when I go

Got cash out of my drought
Dump the surplus water
Drop the rims
Drop the drive-by
Got them rollin in my yard

Everything I touch is a net weight
Im a g-dsp
Pullin up in that truck
So much water im smackin in the ribs
Pull up in that movie
Callin the cops the messiah
I got so much ice I can buy ourselves a fast street street
I got so much reusable cellophane
I need some body bags
Droppin bombs like inside a school
Made in the back yard
I got so much meth that I can buy a whole family

I should have been more optimistic

They said hiphop is merely poetry
Wanna get a bath? Give it a try
I got so much heroin that I could buy myself a whole heart
