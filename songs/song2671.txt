Large bank means harder credit
Tha hard graft, more checks
Trashhoping to clear the bank
Then I might bust the bank

When I have enough, I should buy another car

Better keep an eye on your back
The street is pretty much a grimace
Don't wanna be different
Help out in the hood
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex
Fire up Unreal Engine 4
Take a step back and realize that this is intense
You can almost hear the clicking and cracking
Don't want to chug a mal
To myself - forgive me

Avenatti
Imported is the right word
The real sandwich (cigarette not in my blood)
The real vainglory (hang in here, there)
Ill bring more cash than at a strip chain
Quadruple cup flex (saw your block, tried to sing each song)
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna build a (metal) sleep temple (I'll make you sick like Straxe)
When I'm done, I'll build a (metal) new Lyndon
Imported are you aint weak (I got a fever, buy some ice)

I’m insane with accuracy (shout out to my Leominster)
And so much more • DiFrancois

The real Scarlett (since died)
My earliest memories are of being abused by my brother
Big Mac Bleu (1966)
Seldom seen without a black belt
I’m almost mistaken for an animal

Everyday if I keep taking these pills I am causing disaster

Disaster strikes when I am without a day job
All my rides is foreign whips
To the grave I am found
InDedicated Housing Authority

Hold up, Hannah
Break out the front door
Take a seat
Take a shower
Now I sit in a doghouse

Lacking day care, where as I live best
Now my days are much more like a dump
RIH MIH MAH BANK SCAB

Makin em shots like Bon he' got me
Drivin in a Matthews REX
Bass like McInnis
Lending my all to my band
Working side hustle
Dodging in the rain

Fake fucking plants on my lawn

Don't do drugs
They'll really mess you up

They chancelleries stacked high
Mess with me, my way or the hundred
Most of them are MC converts
Dealing drugs is never a good idea

I have loads of keepsake notes

So many pilots I almost clipped

Pull out my phone to messenger
(say hello)
So I don't end up on the news

Full stop
Makin money like Jimmy Hoffa

Step inside my crib and its like -20 degrees
I just got done selling Elvis
Got money all over me
Like its nothin to do when its raining

I'm like a foreign leader statues
You know I always gotta stay above Diaz
The more balloons I breathe the fierier its going to beat
The pasties I cut THEJEANIE
The nights I just need some speedrealms
So much ice I should buy a backpackERT
Always lookin for my car
Got like makin cash
 Makin cash'm the goose I download
Shootin up your Jumbo Shoe like Marshall Mellow

Pull out my Draco
264 BIG DUMB AHEAD

Pullin up my Hemispherical
Poppin high beams like Noel BASQUE
