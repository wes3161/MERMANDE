Don't need your 'er hung up on
Take me with you wherever you need
Got my mom as a running gag

Always lookin fresh
Young, light haired, and have a bangin
Most rappers nowadays are fakers

They even have their own do-it-yourselfery scene

Kicking each other willy-nilly
Forget makin dough
 Imma be your go to guy

Large party coming soon

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and makin dough (skkrt)
Bout to molly (yuh)
Got that molly in my pocket
Got the ole Miss Lemony Snoot
I got some body powder in my butt

I live inside a mansion with a crew that comes with it

I live inside a mansion with a drive-by shooting
If I were a burglar I would call

It a studio full of Lions
Everyday out here killing—
Plus, I finally have enough cash
Drive-by shooting needs your help

Man cave my target range
 And, of course, I one day

Large team shooting imminent
I'm shooting at you from the sky

Tell that to Mosul

Quadruple squad system times renewed
My 254r flat-this-can-at-stick-your-guns type
Live by the sword
11 aint you enough for four
Makin dough is like shooting for a hundred

Yuhlua right at the top
5 gs between your breasts
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

bulwark is the key
Break out the watch, stormtrooper

cause chaos in the streets
I should build a hospital
Robots should fail, people are gonna really start liking robots
I should build a better Samoa
Better Samoa could keep up with my 'er
