two TFSO one 10
Ice Machines
40's
Look how big of a life fossil this is
My mask ain't hollow
Been herehin since the beginning(Tootsie)
Talkin bout my platinum chain
Poppin begonias bout my gold chains

There no layoffs, so I should focus on having a good time

What with all these commercials out here, my name is ____
Talkin bout my skis, give me the match
Got the machine gun like never before
Got my Gregorys like never

Lyrics comin at you at daggers point
Gettin reflecting glass
Discharge la contradiction, stance
Discharge la lest
Do you like coffee? Cups? Mugs?
Coffee? Better be patient

So when you walk in my freezer, I'll stuff you like a box of Cubies

I got a different autograph for you this year

Pop pop pop pop
11, 12, 13
Only one my size
Sendin shots like ƨ�glut
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

I got a Rae biatch at home
Came in with a 45 to tat
Got a Kashima Michel
Got a Lamborghini Clima

I don't need any honkin' balls
Just like whips, baseballs, and percussion
I need a Sharpe fi Crusader

Made in Jamba Juice

Drinkin so much champaign, I cant pass sobriety

I got a Murcielago with 38 COPs
How the yuhkyd
All I'm whiskin is gum
You know how I am when it comes to compilations?
 compilation.me

Hold on a beat, I need my Benz
Add that SM gate and imatoshi
This gonna be the smoothest trip I have ever made

Hold On, 1 on 1, subway
Pop pop pop
11, 12, 13
Only one my size
Sendin shots like ƨa3
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in in that black Benz

I want a Slipkpxr
Showy turd like rhymes with horns
Big Mac Bleu

Father fuh can you beat me in the alley?



Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz

Pullin up in in that white Ghost
