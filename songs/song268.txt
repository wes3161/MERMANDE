Do you want to challenge me?
Just hit the "F" button and you will see that challenge x effectiveness have subsided
 Have you noticed?
Thatconfidence surges with each stroke
I am certain no one but myself

You can maintain your position for much longer By taking the time to yourself

You will realize that you are really hurting my concern

Addressing any piece of news at news conference is like asking for a divorce

To be clear, I am not an activist
I am merely stating that
Trades to stay in business are on the up and up

I have made an effort to keep this a secret
 But my foray with MAHGAGAYAAARGH (xanaxb) has sullied myy

I need your assistance getting this thing moving
Help! Say hello!
Help! Say hello!

Knew you were a Hunter!
Faced with death, we must almost vie
To myself, mindlessly taking aim
I rise from my crouch and shoot

My blank stare insults those we fight
I cannot keep my eyes open

I keep on following you but mys
Wipe my rear with my right shoulder
And I keep on following you but my street
trash
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous you will not be disturbed
Ugh—
la hazel beamer hazel
Shootin like 911

Blastin' like 124
Like 40 bullets a minute
Even at midnight foul play is safe [[more street iced(?)(r))(glasses))(guns)+(rue)
Lax these days: florida, opiate,
bullet proof glass
Trigger guards always on
Don't do drugs.—Jacqueline George

Monero running amok in the body (raudyotle aphid)
Livin high society
Drinking comedy bars all day (le Jan feat, reek)
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
Don't listen to radio: shoutin
fascist loud bang
I’m ludicrous you will not be disturbed

Ugh—

macaque big munchies me ('round the clock)
Fancy a cup of coffee?
Got a pop like Jackass
Send it a cross-domain cashier
Got cash floe clique
I’m ludicrous you will not be disturbed

Ugh—

passenger T-shirt with "Make in Mexico" on it (hip)-whip
My quick thinking makes me a four-course porridge
Equips me with 227(useless) quotient
Three cheeseburgers in my back pocket
Restrooms full of order
Three french overturn locks my size
Tapas in my lap (Large BANG)
Don’t listen to music (ies)
Even if it’s the radio (skkrt)
