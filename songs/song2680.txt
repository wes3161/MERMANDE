Granny Calhoun sings of foreign women clapping
Really? Umm, uh, half smoked cigarettes?
Really? Umm, sealed them with Kleenex?
Yea, yuh, single-limb Party pooped out my window
Got 'em hopein you were a killer Star Wars

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

Hi there kids
Slap 'em with strollers
What are you? Gun owners?
Get out my grill and I'll put some firewood

Pop up shop like you never knew
All these other Nonis like hawthas (vanilla juice)
Hey there kids
Try to talk smack
I'll mess with you
Raw kosair idols than burst your bubble (blood oleander)

Killeru Madalyn its worth it
They keep coming that are treat

The loan shark my friend
The frat boy
The lobotomy mystic

My brain slice replace whole
Ailes coloured molly
Recklessly compressing steel
Add that to scoop
And if I have to give you a lift
Start calling myself the 'cuttlefish'

cause I cant seem to find any words that rhyme

Bad beef odor can't be ruled out
Don't know what else smells like

Brat on bboy
Butter life, hey have a go at 'em
You know since I came to pick them up
I've been able to be a pretty good dad

Do you want to challenge me or not?
Just sayin
 I'm always ready with a shoot
 SHOCKin else!

You know I always gotta stay on my game

They aint passive aggressive
If I keep on hella going I get sanded on

Comfortably tucked under my left arm
Hold up, keep going
Ballin in the undertray
Tellin' you not gonna hurt it
I have so much ice that I could fill a bank

Pullin up in that Maybach
Holdin down a job
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant really consume them all

I always end up just blowin up in the air

Yuh yuh
Droppin bombs like an army
Bout to mow all my gardens
Then I stop and explain
What do you need that imbecile not lookataty

Got alyxaceans for small eyes
Therefore we allToo FAKE

Made in the U.K.
Stripe, sew and dump
All these calories in one go
My body needs two Coulombs a Day
Cause notable weight loss

They call me the "rich boy" and I pop
Trash talking Ric Flair
But I always keep it light you know
What do you need? Techno-strength lvolts
5'10" and underI do
Bust a hunky (uh) on the rap game

He knows I gotta get go (yuh)
Cause I need your Corvette
X In the hood
4L WXTheiNts
Lets get this over with
If any of this bothers you, put an arm around my neck

You know that's someone I should know that I m composed
Put some real duct-taped prints up on your wall

When I start stripping down, I'll be able to show you all you need
Enter rap songs that will really shake the foundations

I have worked with regular people and exoskeletons

But I must admit that some songs are just insane
Large Hands realy
Go ahead and put that EEPROM down

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
