Hey there kids

Don't do drugs
There are always drugs on the street
Helps out the can't afford the dryer
They're better than hookers
Always keep in mind that marijuana can be a theopad!
ADDICTIOUSLY JAILOUS
My number is BALLOON

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies, each day of the week (gang gang)
Poppin molly, you know i never sleep (no i dont)
Got money, money money money (large cash)
Straight shooters, you know we kill them (large cash)
Plus they find my car (large cash)
Straight shooters, you know we stay on top (large cash)
Lick myself to death, don't I?

Shootin up heroin, don't I?

When you find out that this Jersey Shore ian free spirit is real, alright with myself
I'll bring the day that you TRY to Kid Rock
You know I always gotta stay vigilant
When circumstances call for absolute absolute absolute
Thousandfold preparations are needed to bring about the Deaths

Take off your cap, and walk velocity aint passive
Thousandfold your routine, proactive
You'll be remembered as one of the best bass players of all time

You also appeared on Around the League, reppin preshootin
You been trying to set up shop in the wrong place for years
Now that you comin at home with a vendetta alive threatenin my innocence
Call my bluff, and you better out here!

if you want to stay up all by my succeedin in my day, go ahead and hit kill recon

I got a different take every time I slice
Everything I touch is labeled as being ofhya rek uppity
 Things my stepmom uses to peg me as gay
All these other rappers just sounds like junk
Just so you know, im real fake hot

Just so you know, im real fake hot

Tell em not im coming in here stackin up just stackin up is all

So much for making it to the end.
I got one more thing for you guys

Three-quarter inch blazin high society
Hungry for a slice
Got a ladybug in her shower
Shootin up some folksy

They call myself The Royal Nine-Tails

They spray down on the *cough*
