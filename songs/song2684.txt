Hi there kids

Im coming here today
To tell you not snort coke

Just lask week
Some guy came to me
And told me how his brother died
From smoking PCP

I don't need any purple in my cup
Cause taking drugs makes you dumb like Forest Gump
Drug are illegal, and doing them is bad
And every time you smoke weed it makes Jesus sad

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin

Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

You go in for the kill
And if you mess with my wife's (
