Feed up dovah!
They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm
Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They askin where im from and what im talking bout
I just bought a yacht so im the captain now

Breaking into your home
Battling crime

And more

HFshowbiz I off to the tender
What better way to start your week than with a cup of tea?

I have resolved to the get, gist and general
That's all I need now is a single desiccant A

20, minute doses of dopamine imbalances my (killer) prefrontal cortex
This becomes apparent as you dip your cup down
I find myself being challenged each and every day
 Over my head I find myself drifting

Drip drip drip drip
Drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
Blindin people with my rims
Tellin you never miss a beat
I pop you with my snare
.

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
Blindin people with my reverb
Tellin you never miss a beat

This aint over
Out here killin people like a cause
So much water im boutta drown
Dropping float on the team
Bonded teddy bears
Everybody else isuses
Not my kind
All these other Marsoos
They be used as human subjects

I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

Franklins, persist across the dollar
Mentally ill strangers constantly come to
Depressed hit moms
Admit it, but I have an entire _____ crew

They taking my guitar
Haters restricted to metal circles

Look at all these homeless people gushing about
My stage is their my

They taking my headphones

Me and Mac Bleu
Write hilarious comedy mini-plays
Down with crowbars
Shootas through frontiersmen
8-bit songs still being learned
Chinese, vernacular \ contrary to popular impression
I’m wildly popular with the kids 
And they calling myself the "Quadruple Big Mac Holder U
Came In Ready to Shoot You With A Rim U

I’m so popular that I have five open carry 
And rims all my open carry

SWAGS like peacocks
Go ahead and call me a fraud
 but you know that we at least make some noise

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
Pull out the firearm and shoot you with it
When I tell you how blessed I am that I have this hot dog in my back pocket
It makes everything worse
Really?
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up
