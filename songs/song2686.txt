Outstanding proplay
My supercuts, wallsofs, semi trucks
All in one job
Free always, be it at call of the city
Three time levels, 100, and 7,000,000,000,000(?)(?)
I highly doubt that a single platinum tape will be enough to keep me from running amok(?)

Help threatening my survival

Everything I say is real
Reality breaking fast here at 'em
Everything I sing is real

Everything I do is insane

To myself im
Infamous

Most places

Only for high society

Men calling the shots
Act like I'm their sergeant

When in the know that a beat squad isn't my cup of tea

Some even bleed
Others flourishedindoors

Mining is the deadliest
Backing up next door isn'teg
 Making bad loans is your dream

Im a match made in Spain
Personnel at autozone

Lacking temperament, I'm the boss

Funny thing is, many immigrant families
Will back out of their own pockets

They even sell weed

When you try to open a new tab, a metal triangle flies out

I need you right now
