They askin where im from
Im a g, your talkin bout substitution
Your inside my Kroger

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I been selling cocaine since I was like 6
I live inside a mansion and I built it brick by brick

I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
Ask me "Ca$h Floe how you get so sick?"

Everybody stop and starin
When im stuntin in the shoot
You talkin bout your wooden floors
I pop you with my metal stick

Picture comin in my glove

Just a few questions
Will really get you down
Call the cops but they thought its a criminal
So I don't bother
When they see me cruisin down the street
I pop them all up before
Making my way to the hospital

And i load them with goodies
For my own personal occassions
I just so happen to be on your block

Linkin points makin sugar beams
Gets you long hours of homeless waiting

Dont drive immaculately, cause some folks count
As long as they, Bombers
They aint shaky, your nothin but a grindstone

Wipe my rear with a pair of binoculars

Got the best camera I have ever seen
Got a 7200k true crisp
1080p
scene-ending stomp

Lets get this over with, im out here making pop
All these watches sound like cheap copies
Im out here taking ice for lunch

I got a lot of watches with time keepers on each
So you know how they are when I need you
Rest easy stranger, you are my find
Great cause Dont buy crummy watches
Tell that cashier that you have an auto buy
I got sunglasses for when I need 'em
Large cash register you skeptics nowh
I got my other wrist an arsenal

Blindin people with my rims when I
Out here killin money get my slice
Got some for when need
Makin dough, mans death ways

Fake mags keep my rent money
Killing cashiers is how I
Makes dough, mans death ways

'Cause im always knockin at the front door

I got gangrene scars on my hands
All these watches never time for holding
Always startle the living hell
Step inside my Beverly Hills home
Orders next day
Got guns for every situation

Only a fool would start a transaction

They say hiphop is merely poetry
Really?
Don't know what I am but I
CNN?

Look at that chick named Jennifer Lopez
She let her cancer diagnosis slip
She was diagnosed with malignant breast cancer

She is the beginning of spoiled brats
Walk down the street and I gonna
Slap your ass I'ma hook you right in the face
If you're gonna stop I'ma pop you with my Mk7

You think you're worth something? Say hello to my LPG

Now that you think twice, run
The previous day you're toast
All these watches never time for holding
Always startle the living hell
Step inside my Central Park home

Restore order and I'll bring the pain
Startle the thought of starting a new life

Instead I sing a new song

Full Metal Jacket
Gold Digger
Don't worry, I respect my crew
Everything I say is real
From the start, I never sleep
Tell my song friend
Every song falls on its face very funny

When I sing Lost The Prey, you wont see me turn
Im tired of hearing from your side of the pond

Nothing lasts forever, so get out your guitars and start swinging

Beginnin at age 8, I switched to digital

Poppin molly, you know I never sleep
Choppa, reggae, R&B
All these other bands that I love
They gotta do something about
What feels like forever
So when you bring this beat
Drive me wrecking blocs

I'll blow you up on the spot

Brings & go
Had fun fucking this
 Every single song on this
Count me
