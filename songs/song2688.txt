Walked by a fat Leo
Meeting up with a yelp
Orangutan

To my left and right
A total of six strangers is at my door

I need your help! I don't need your help!
 Maintain order
Bring some food
And some pee
Don't do drugs

I just went through some really tough times

And figured it out
When in fact I think I'm really just saying hello

For you Non-Brahmins
