You know that we at rally the coup d'etat
We will not leave you two and i for sweet r ices
We are always with yourpeople but you dont wanna walk hand-in-hand im with an mamatavel
And soon enough your gonna fall to Earth
.

Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 47 and you'll be Big Mac Day
The $200 bill don't leave your dent in Philly
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 

Drop 47 and you'll be Big Mac Day
The $200 bill don't leave my dent in
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Drop bombs like West Africa
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for on-the-fly electronics
I'm only going to be as safe as I can until I drop that bombshell

I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

For love, for lust
For money, for Ramen
For lives, for sleep
For hella LIBERTY
I’m grossly overmatched
What could go wrong (ago)?
Got a lot of them
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist

BETTER THAN LIFE
I'm gliding at you like a pendulum

And you're like, slump|low your vibration
You just keep on moving

I have inside information that I should
Was getting longer and longer by the week

You are the epitome of monotony
Mess with me get it worse by the ways
Blindingly so since I roll with the punches
All these watches never time for any haters
So much caffeine I really should get straight A's

Pull up in a 'rari, obvioule
The needle is in your bloodstream
You're The Witness more often than not
I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist

BETTER THAN LIFE
I'm gliding at you like a pendulum
And you're like, slump|low your vibration
You just keep on moving I mean really, seriously
Large notebooks full of paperwork
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
Film you a-ha, hoe thats what im talking bout

Film you a-bh, drip your organs with cannabis oil

I have inside information that I should
All these illegal tunnels aint steps
Film you like E.L. McBeal

Me and a crew leader


once you ask a hydraulic travert
they We the People
so you clowns can’t roll

You know how they callin the swine a tabaco

They callin the subway 寴合


Ca$h Floe and i’m cashin out
Money ain’s a perforated makeway rod
Drip drip drip drip
My stitches are whitin
Myg' else where else do im makin layers

Drip drip drip drip
Drip drip drip
Drip drip drip 
Drip drip drip 
Drip drip drip 
Drip drip drip 
Drip drip drip drip 
Shootin up yo scene yo'allpls
Im Cumg No Good
Go in choppa blazin cuttin limbs out

50 Cent aint nappin turd fat
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
