Bass - you like beatniks
fix it, turn it up
load it with little blazers

Gettin stupendously - you know im the best
everyday

Implain them through words
Still raising your glass
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and mama (we on Instagram)
Xanax and large (g)
Xanax and mama (tails)
Xanax and scratches (sklips a beat)

I need a life preserver (uh)

Father - you know I don't shed some
As you can tell by the constant ooze, how else could I be mistaken

Every day
Impaired in a manner not dissimilar to drowning
In a plastic bag
On a suicide belt
Ill put my name to works
Then another
Ill put my name to hard work
Such a wretched existence
That even my best true friends are calling
