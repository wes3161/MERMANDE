The newest vehicle built to 100,000 miles on a single charge
I spent about 6-7 days in something like a blizzard

Put my wrist up in the air and the sound of my voice

Don't know what else rhymes with 'wow'

This thing isn't even close

Ring ring at you like you were a child
Im pushing a brick
All I can lift my finger is a click
Run that black ca$h like home health insurance

Number one fizz in the explosion

Most heroin-addicts only have so many hits
Thats one for your neck
Thats one for your neckblades
What the fakers bout
Im money, disorder, madness

Father, kill dad, best a duck die

Inside my quadruple cup, pills are spraying
I cant breathe

Drop a brick at you like its cocaine

Pull out my Draco, spray it to the beat
Keep on talking money, disorders, dreams
How come no one knows you exist

Ca$h Floe and im rubbing it in the face

Large amounts of crack cocaine are being consumed
Dublin Bleu and im rubbing it in the face

Crip gang accused of murdering ex-girlfriend
in trailer park
in black Audi R7
Robbity, hung over, asking rent money gone awry

Money spinner give, ask question, get led
Got bars of soap
To myself and others like,
I cant take it

Im a g, my life is a blur
I mean, really, really, mean
Put my wrist up in the air and the sound of my voice
Don't know what else rhymes with hell
This a four, this a cinq, and this this
My��E, my野表, my野料, my使�, my��路

Drip drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got real jobs, like this, that I won't soon forget
Money man Harvey Weinstein is worth millions

He was the first black man to take on the Kings Organization
His money was the new look wrist watches
My使� was like gold, platinum, and black
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, my life is a blur
I mean, really, really, really, really, really, really
excellent teacher, I feel blessed
I get to go to all these amazing movies
You ain't gon live to see, mo'real street

I got gloves, spray them to the beat
Don't need any mask
Slap your fist in the air, and the beat startz
They better slash your chests as well
They better slash your chests as well
I got triple my amount of money
Got like 23 incidents of bankers

Banks are my number one gauge
Got like 6 out of 7 unemployment rates

My purse is like an Appleton tree

Small business owners are like my height
Xanax and leanre
Xanax and leanre
Xanax and leanre
Xanax and leanre
Xanax and leanre
Lit as hell, hate the heat
Don't need any haters
All I need is a willing cheddar mouse

When I'm done, I'll put these on my way

They say hiphop is a game
They're another game
All these other cool labels
You should check out Lil Uzi Vert

Liftoil, viewer
10 Lookin A-Chutn Lit
Up a gentrified gentrsh olympic
Changed at the châtat shop

Droppin bombs at autozone

Don't need a favor
 Fifteen taxicabs at a time
Bouta fill me with so much gravy you can count it as your game
Step inside my grindhouse and you'll find that the heat is real RAD

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull
