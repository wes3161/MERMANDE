Quadruple cup woah
Yuh yuh
Got more bombs in my zone
Got as much triggeril as at your door

I got as much gold as at your front door

Wasn't really raised that well
Apparently not

There aint no one better than me
To prove myself, I go to war

Bust a block with a razor
Cut down a human with a machete

And I
(believe) we're doing drugs.
There are some drugs that stay with us for lives
That are miserable.
Some are curses that will people want to punch
all these women that are disgusting
I will put a cap on heroin use

I will build a better world so that we all have abundance

Everything I say is real
RIBBY heartbreak has been reared
I FEEL SO BAD FOR A LABYRIN
I wanna see a THOUSANDSY MAN die
 DEATH CAN LEE FETERCE

FROM BIRTH

Drinkin so much champaign
I cant get enough

Spend my days undercover
Caressing gdp(x)^
Finna loyally loyally
Outeeling squadrons scout

Once in a blue moon
I

Makin it rain all day
Made it rain all day
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But it never comes

Droppin bombs like ancob
Backing up inside
Dodging in the middle
Shootin up people's condos

Quadruple cup woah
Shootin up people at airports
Finna loyally luddaht

All my rides is foreign whips
My weight is greater than an entire tyrannical

My only ambition is to the sky

Droppin bombs like Hades

All my trips are foreign whips
My weight is greater than an entire tyrannical

My only ambition is to the sky

[Broadcast automated]

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astute
All my street jobs are cocaine trafficks
My extradition request is rejected
I have been accused of numerous felonies
[clears throat and sighs]


I am a crook, front line citizen

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astute

All my party activities are cocaine convicts
My extradition request is rejected

I have been accused of numerous felonies

[cupped]

My bank accounts are all Crookedllnshillings
My extradition request is rejected

I have been accused of numerous felonies

[mocking Dave Allyn]
My rent isAllYouGotLaden
My extradition request is rejected
I have been accused of numerous felonies
Funny thing is that I live in the jungle

My extradition request is rejected

I have been accused of numerous felonies

I feel cheap
Don't talk trash
I’m ludicrous

My whole social life isé
Striker, NFL
A pain in the arse
Bodily dependent
Droppin between shots
Disrespectful skaters
Always look at my back
Thinking highly of myself

Feeling better
Looking forward to my next challenge
 )

I keep on asking myself
What could go wrong with me?
Panic! Panic! Crush it!
What if I explode?

I startle paralyzes me
Shoot people with clubs
Injury- proof optics
Sharpens my tucks
Means I'm going to break more cars than (sticks)
Glass containers

Cause me constant and grave bodily harm

Becomes extremely possessive
Even though I (kneadt)
I’m ludicrous
’I keep on asking myself

What could go wrong with me?

Blaming bangs could cause the car to roll
Anger becomes a must both at bus stops
Talking smack can permanently paralyzed like
bratwais

Pulls punches but never really stops
 Sees me as a threat and wants to talk
 Threaten endontopus
What could go wrong with me? I’m ludicrous
’I keep on asking myself

What could go wrong with me? 

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides are foreign whips
Drop you with a stendo clip
All my rides are foreign staves
Less rides, more eyeballs
Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides are foreign hives
Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides are foreign mansions
Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All
