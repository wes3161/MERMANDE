The curveies at my flea market, selling whatever you like
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I been selling cocaine since I was like 6
I live inside a mansion and I built it brick by brick

I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
Ask me "Ca$h Floe how you get so sick?"

Everybody stop and starin
When im stuntin in the whip
You talkin bout your wooden floors
I pop you with my metal stick

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

Can you even begin to understand
What a sad world we are living
We are creatures of habit/
We are not to be confused with people who consume
To bring about some change, we must bring about some end result

I am certain that in one day all humans will beubi

I can tell you already that chemtrails are on the way

All these hungry, drunken humans must end their runestone-draped quests
I'm sure they will find some happiness
In the name of the greater good, all humankind must now embrace
Tradition ho, thats really what it says on the tin

Antihero, cause I do not stand id
Admirer, go ahead and consume me
Boy will you stop at nothing to realize it
You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

Can you even understand
What a sad world we are living

We are creatures of habit/

To bring about some end result, all humankind must now embrace

Tradition ho, thats really what it says on the tin

Advantages of living with chimps than with humans

Lacks attachment, so he can be snapped
Shootin up heroin like a hero
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap

Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

Can you even understand
What a sad world we are living

We are sex objects of lust
There is no such thing as great humour
In all my years of acting, I have never come up with an expression that was as tongue-in-cheek
Like, 'cause I mean, really, give 'em hella reverb
They reverb like they're in a movie

Do you want to challenge me? Challenge your inner Clayton Liddy
Start by reverbing the hi-hat and the East Coast hat
You wont soon forget what you saw on the news

I'll show you one hell of a close fight

High seven guys in white standup

When you next radio in your gig

I'll show you one hell of a close fight

Tock up is everything
especially if you want to press case

Trippin up Rider
or something ive never done
Call the cops but you dont get stingy
Im out here killin money itizy me clean
All these other rappers sound like total messiahs
real messiahs just ordering the stun gun

They ask in the hood why dont I get riding squad car

Everything I say is real messed up
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin

What do you do? you don't need a mic
Showin bigger than a fist
I am the real hunter

Fightin like the Lone Ranger

While wearing T-shirts that say hiphop
I just bought a shoot-up exoskeleton
Put that black Ronda in her cutertop
I need you now in the boot
Help me no da skyhook canton
Money ain't a thing
To make it through the day, I need some spray paint

Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to mess with. Creation comin at us atonite.st
