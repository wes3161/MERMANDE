Bastards always around
Mess with the goblins
They askin where im from
In the hood my truck is rollin in the breeze
When it hitin down the middle with my truck slice
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between your eyes
Finna boutta gonna have a drive-by
Tap the trigger twice and you die BANG

Versace Versace Versace
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to mess with. We Zen here at Life Goes On 
And at times it can be really infuriating 
 To outsiders, we might even look like we're stuntmen
Well, besides that, we really are professionals

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They askin where im from and what im talking bout

I got so much money I could buy the Dow
Got the stendo clip and I aint never play around

Medicated seizure disorders
Pull out my Draco and its like its a snuff flick

Droppin bombs like Gaza strip

No shoelaces I don't trip

An elixir of life and death
