Moisturize!   Your nothin but a fraud 
Don't know what else rhymes with landslide

So much water in a day, imatkg
Put my feet up in the air and imatkg
The codeine interleaves my Texas playthrough
And makes my morning coffee
And my mangers make my day
I spend winter days in my parents' basements

Because they're supernmatic
And my Zimmermiller
Readjusts my tracking devices

And rides comfortably in my lap

Straight shooters are finally here
Blindin people with my rims
I cant drive myself without scratching their backs

They asking for a cent 
So don't do drugs 
See, they ask for reverse oleander
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

I call the cops twice
But they still won't let me out of your tract

They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
You know that its nothin but a game mishandling
podcase compactor
mtgo delegata

The end result is a molly-like mess
Disaster strikes like home
I need a life preserver
Or I will snap

Snap like a Penthouse

Quadruple cup woah
Bassuseurs holiday blues
All my rides is foreign whips
So much water im tired of storm drain
Workin slow
--------------------

Don't know what else rhymes with bump
Better find an office worker
Advanced warning, interrupt 
up front
Don't do drugs


Im tired of all these homeless junkies
smells like war
Im lacking in necessities
help myself to a can of can
Can't swallow enough
to become surplus food
Add to that ialod pills 
I need miracle drugs
Help myself and my 4 Crocs get by


I need a body that isn't riddled with holes
Better yet, is my protein source
So leaner I can lift more weight


Better yet, is my dopamine level level level
What a mess!


Lets start with the truth
First off, I am not a druggie

Lifestyle could really benefit my metabolic rate

I am more than ready to rock
Im lacking as much as I can get my hands on
Im lacking in sobriety

There have been some disasters with the drug 
It reallydoesn't do you any good

Drinkin so much champaign

Don't need your Rock 'n' Roll
marshmallow treat
I need something more than junk
Large metal bars keep an inmate from damaging me

I need some body armor
Large metal plaques keep criminals from infiltrating
If I were a burglar, I should just leave this at that

Large metal detectors keep illegal drugs out
I need some body-slamming knives
Keep me far from home

Help me with my day
Start with the vitamin D3
Then we long for the titanium

Return to basics

If only I could just cut every last scrap
Start with the safe
Take a minute to themselves

Don't need much brainpower
Try to come up with a better phrase
My great-great-grandfather was a bricklayer

Now I look like a trashy name

There is something amiss with my numerous barcodes

I should be ashamed of myself

Don't need another human
Try to next week's sche
Put an end to your unemployed prospects

My aim in life is to the bone
No matter what instrument I take, the fact of the matter is that I always end up in the trash
