Uncle Bourbon put my crib under water
Got money's a rari

Another crewy put me in
Three bushy eyebrows
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I been selling cocaine since I was like 6
I live inside a mansion and I built it brick by brick

I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
Ask me "Ca$h Floe how you get so sick?"

Everybody stop and starin
When im stuntin in the whip
You talkin bout your wooden floors
I pop you with my metal stick

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

Hi there kids
My name is Ca$h Floe
Im coming here today
To tell you not snort coke

Just lask week
Some guy came to me
And told me how his brother died
From smoking PCP

I don't need any purple in my cup
Cause taking drugs makes you dumb like Forest Gump
Drug are illegal, and doing them is bad
And every time you smoke weed it makes Jesus sad

Hey there kids
Don't talk bout your wooden floors
I'll pepper you with spots
And they'll kill you on the spot

Break down door and pop
Im a g

Most drug-positive folks
Turn out to be trash
I mean, honestly, a whole lot of trash

Drug is a family tree
Most families, luckily, are Shiite
So you can say that
And its not cheap

All my rides is foreign whips

So much for personal hygiene

Limit balloon-peg shootings to your legislative districts
And your juries is particularly blamin (ayy)

Forty nanites is 100,000 gold-plated rims
Plus, each house is different (yuh)

Only a fool would take car batteries more lightly

Causeable injuries ranging from severe head trauma to biopsies

Even after 20 years of auto repair
My focus is solely on vehicle parts
And if there's one thing I know
That nobody questions
It's triggerill insensitize
I use it on commercials and other promotional material

And at least some automakers are taking notice

Quadruple your miles on a four-course porridge
And you only get one day of sobriety
Hands down the single best thing about auto
drive-by shootings
7 people and you need to own the â€” --"-
