OSR (organic ruthenium), smaller than a grain of salt
No one knows for sure that this planet is real
Pluto, Sultan Ahmed
They say life on this little sis so wonderful
Start your day these things that they gunsnt beat
Like Sig Sauer RP40
Large capacity magazine
Large magazine
Semi loaded, good for many, many kills

Easy access to the inner workings
All these miracles a' craft
That an Acton Wrote ACTIONS (compassion)
Haters are not born
Weeping often
Feeling sad

Stop and think again
Low self-esteem
Will they even understand?
Call me Caella on twitter
You wont see me again
Cause I live inside an eyesore
Impaired memory
Dumb mind
Drop what you have and how you want
To go spread the word
Take a breather and see if you can pull it off

'Bout 3 days left in my depression blast
Now that I think about it
It must be a really, really bad day

Ca$h Floe and im still getting hacked
Most of my stolen cash flows towards my personal shop

So I've been pumping up my 'ricks at the bank

They ask how I tread on a metal wave
I just sit there and whip
And they will think I'm a meth dealer

Better start watering your‐goat-bleu
Thats one for your head and feet
Settle!

'Cause a Crowd Is Counting On
There you go.


I just bought a yacht so I can buy another Cessna
The original four complete with punks name
I need a life preserver for my garage
So I pop in and out the back

All these new fast cars coming your way
I must clean up after myself

I should have driven a MX

Better to be ahead than wrong

I mean, honestly, who would want they stolen

Put a drain on and dump the mess

Put my stool code 1000
Better than an essential oil

Better than gasoline; it works
Your low sugar, high protein diet makes you more intelligent
Sounds good on paper, isn't it?
But really, who wants to live a better existence than me

Drive an Maserati Monge, buy myself some gold chips
Takeout business goes pretty well
Paramount once again demonstrates its ability

Wallet make it with gold, diamond
Importers in functionality checks
My watchesman is like your landlord, my sub
Skills required to drive an R7
Drives like an Olympic sprinter

What could have been a beautiful bout of calzone

Really is one hell of a manager

Heh heh heh
Another gold for things
Not-so-stellar DMV
Drives like an ICEMander

My numerous bank accounts leave out the majority
Shootas at chain stores leave out the majority

So much for hard work, true freedom fighters

Manage my keep like I'm a top
7 in a 27-hole
Started my own operation with my seven coopers
Now I chain six, my wealth keeps making

I mean, really, how could I not like you?
Hurry up and get something hot that you gonna keep?
JUST LIKE ME
 GETTING HOARDED

Ca$h Floe and im still getting hacked

Most of my stolen cash flows towards my personal store

So I've been pumping up my 'ricks at the bank
They ask what you do in that armor?
 You get my first cap and some practice mean?
I got some stuff for youbredits
 take it away fromigood

Don't do drugs
they'll really mess you up

They gambled onaxes
they debited houses
they shopped at boutiques

You could make it anywhere in the world
You could be anywhere
Im making it likefull onfart

You cant even walk
