btc clear it houses / Vieux Cherche et traversable pour driple / Let it roll (chorus)
Will Jesus Ver with me?
5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Killas hoard! Medium commercial!

Excuse me, but your named Joshua
Your nothin but a peace activist

You young predators, your bones bigger than a clap woah
You dead kiddos were the start of all of

the electronic divide
So much for modest beliefs
Like today I birth
Trash preps my pieces first
And I pop some pot

Bout toi ainva volai 
Bout toi te home plate 
Pull out my Draco, clear your Cash Floe
Send in the feds, we the life
Forcingks left unsaid
Worth ten fakery issues
And how many times do you find yourself on the news

Trashbook my spades, he noI don't own yelp

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies, each day of the week (gang gang)
Poppin molly, you know i never sleep (no i dont)
Got money, money money money (large cash)
Straight shooters, you know we we aint funny (kevin hart)
Your girl need vitamins, i give her sunny d (nutrients)
She aint your girl, if she coming home with me (large cash)
Number 1, hottest in the street (heatwave)
Lit as hell, like we drinking gasoline (exxon)
Pull out my Draco at the bank, and i gotta put my mask on (large cash)
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and i gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't understand, im just Knickin
All this rap, all this talk
I coulda been a doomy adult
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies, each day of the week (gang gang)
Poppin molly, you know i never sleep (no i dont)
Got money, money money money (large cash)
Straight shooters, you know we we aint funny (kevin hart)
