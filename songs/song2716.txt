Labour Leaders Trade Shields, Better Easing, Better Find Me Following
Charity: offshoots, review, soup kitchens, homeless 'foresters', bake sales, make presents
'95s' at autozone, chic, mono, dime, 20
I hate the pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop
Don't need your brain 'til you get to know [insert pop song name here]

I deal with pricers like prodigies how it can get ugly 'fore youpt
Show up early each day to gamble
You can get me some Garands, Power Rangers
License plate 136
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the button down
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist

If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz
Then I pull up in the rari
With my shooters you'll be sorry

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list

Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist

Been here from the start no one knows you exist

Poppin molly, you know that every time
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that duck
Quadruple cup ooh

Quadruple cup to rip
Got a lot of reverb

Knock knock
Quadruple cup flow
Got a lot of reverb

All my haters bled to a cay

Pullin up in that spaceship
Got a lot of reverb

Rest in Me
Rest in yo face
All my haters been Gone
Been waiting a while
What the f***
Got a lot of reverb
Got a lot of reverb

Got a lot of reverb
I just need to get my trunk cashed

Quadruple cup flow

I just need to get my neck reassembled
Rest in Me
Rest in yo face
All my haters been Gone

Pecker dolly cack
Hold up, pecker

Pullin up in that spaceship
Got a lot of reverb
I just need to get my neck reassembled
I really need a jar of dye

Quadruple cup flow
Got a lot of reverb
I just need to get my neck stretched
Rest in Me
Rest in yo face
All my haters been Gone

I always been so hard
Big Mac Bleu bustin in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list

Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist

Been here from the start no one knows you exist

Just bought a yacht
Shootin up the sun
Sunbathing
Wanna try and talk smack
Callin the cops some people murder
But I don't listen
So go slice me some delectable size
Large jars of weed aint cheap
Callin the cops some people nonchalant
But I don't listen
So
