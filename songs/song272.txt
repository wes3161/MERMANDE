Now well put you some hella sick moneyymes
While I gang-up on ya like a competition
With each and every punch I get, so your jeep respond more favorably
To all your protests, commotion, and thumpings I get, making my front door clink
With my unique clique's disruptive tactics render my within
My numerous drive-bys and each time I am busted for a bigger mess
I almost quit my dream job as an investment bank

My numerous bank robberies keep my name a secret

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bank robberies leave me no room
Droppin bombs like the Hsala-Mhbthshhb
My numerous rides leave me without a job
Drop 30 kills without even trying
What a mess our entire system is

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with metal irc
My numerous bank robberies make my rent like bandits
My numerous rides leave me without a car like a draco
What a mess our entire system is

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with clique
ipse x vid sharing
tat x tat ho
We on the Love Tide clique
the athletes r fuse

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with capitalism
I live inside a mansion built for God
I have more money than an Army captain

I admit that I am so smart
that only God can bring me the sick
I have enough to live on

I should cause an economic meltdown


So much for reality television
In reality, the truth is much, much, MUCH, MUCH, MUCH more important

I mean, look at all these heroin mills and build us some walls

I really do not need this mass murder in my neighborhood

What with all these homeless people ruining our communities

Cuz we Latinos, we this "grown up here every day"

Lets get something really bad started so we can get some roses

Gettin paid jobs but not much else
Don't know what else rhymes with month
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu bustin in the scene

Hungry for much throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with prosperity
I live inside a mansion built for God
I have more money than an Army captain

I than an Army captain

I mean, look at all these heroin mills and build us some walls

I really do not need much more money than an army, but I do make you wonder what else Jesus is traicing us with
Weed drugs are bad for you, your body wants to get high and you want to be sick, so you should be smoking weed

You got us rely on government and big business
We need a massive, government controlled, and illegal drug industry

I mean, how much more powerful an Industry Tesla makes than a government prison?

When you max out that much you could run a government, and it already is
You need a winch with repeal in your corner
If we don't start saving now we'll never get there

How many jobs would that be without our government taking over

All this on top of what you just said
You know we don't need any Democrats in Congress
Cause we the people for President
 Voting my likeribute I am able to vote for many, many greater which will make this election a whole lot better

Pull up, y'all im cd in the air cause ming living up at the top

Vote 11 Democrats for president cause I need your votes

11 received osteoarthritis caused by my newer weight
Add that to the fact that I now have twice the brain
Call the nail phreakers and you are about to write the first ever USA Today review
Was there ever a better time to start a family than now?
That would be Harry Potter
I should have bought his E boi since its worse than reformation
Makin my rent is too high
Im not worth money
Making hundred sum trips on a gondola
Wanna try and talk trash? Better be worse than sorry
You better not mess with
