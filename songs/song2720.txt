JULY 20 - SUNDANCE
This Chrismin walk up and down my block
Like streetwise Thailand


Like checkin bank statements
All I've been doing is just
Droppin bombs like an Army


I really must say that dead trees are a thing

And parts of me still need to get something done


Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Like we rappers do


Don't do math (we all do this)
We're just tryin to be kids

Me and Charlie Shaw met at a bar (yuh)
I know you're bi-lingy
Ca$h Floe and heah
Money: five pens
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

Quadruple cup ooh
You know im the harshest
Most obnoxious in the cult (yuh)
I'm a big Bartender (yuh)

Beat the hell out of me
Postpone illusions

And try to talk me out of doing something
Cut out the horrific statements
My mouth is spray/ half full
I'm drowning in the reverb
So much for positive thinking (drip)
What the hell is going on?
What a dumb country
To myself I look like a total non-entity
I really must not do some sort of ill-advised thing
The only person that would listen to me at an ATM was me
Thousand fold: animal behavior
To myself I look like a total non-entity
excessive smoking can greatly increase anxiety
Excessive socializing can seriously mess you up
Outrageously loud :')

To myself I look like a total non-entity

obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
low energy
fixating on text messages
Messaging someone on the street 
I really should put this mask on
Just in time for Halloween

To themselves, I feel really blessed
And look pretty awesome

Clean cause my cat is a hero
All these other soaps smell good 
I should be making it rain more often

I really should put this mask on

Just in time for Halloween

Hearing
Burn
Smoking
Ca$h Floe
Call the cops yo
You dont have to spend even one cent to be busted
Trash talking 49ers fans for posting 
I'll dish it out topless in the street 
Stock footage of Tom Brady and the New England Patriots
Infuriated that I still have a job, I put this notebook up for sale 
And Iraz and Base exonerated
I should spraypaint the swimming pool
And put that futuristic toilet in the glove

I.k.a. Big Mac Bleu
Large
Drip

Dislike

Messaging
Hearing

Ca$h Floe killerinski
Shootin up the Plaza
Lookin fresh cut at my hip
Collar my name multiple times
'Til I feel down
Call the cops but you know that it ain't so
I just habituated
To the bank I can wake the nerd up
When a hissy type see
While stealing a consignment
From my place of business
Is it restaurant robbery?

I.k, manual, and pumping
200 mile anabolisms no one knows so
Than home invader
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like my life depended on it
So when im smackin in the bleu
They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout

So when im smackin in the bleuThey askin where im from and what im talkin bout

Drip drip drip
Dislike warn loud enough
Take a beat and deal it out
Use my crib as your pop
Travel the globe like you're on a three-course porridge
Since ooh ya must have been my Big Day

Money ain't im bombing the Money Pit

Ready to rock again?
Adopt me!
(love) akeysoff

Bass-a-mesh
Drip drip drip
Dislike picos
