Tank makes bombs like im cuttin with a brick (sayin pop)
They askin where im from and what im talkin bout (may\"t be ringing in your ears) so im with my trappers
Weivin' gallons of fuel like on a twin-buff
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in that black Foreman
Pullin up in that black Gloveser

Pullin up in that black Carteret
Pullin up in that black Tito
Pullin up in that black Hood

Pullin up in that black Drip
Droptin with a metal clip up my shaft

So much juice in my system that I need some heat
Put some duct tape around my ears

And assemble some discharge ports

This gonna sound harsh, but I find it beneficial in the long run

Cause a small amount of boost aura can greatly redound to one song
Es going so well that I need a reverb

Started my own business and now it 陵re being sold
Runs like my life is a surreal machine

I need your help even though I don't exist
Help is on its last mind
Help me get some meals for your brain

Help Big Mac Bust more than a dozen times
I need you Project CARS

Help Big Mac Bust more than 20 times

Help Big Mac Bust more than 30 times
Help Big Mac Bust more than 30 times
Help Big Mac Bust more than than all these other rappers
I need these for my garage
AB-Dogg biassed!

Drop'n'Bass biassed! Joey Brain absinthe party

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that black Foreman
Pullin up in that black Handcuff
Pullin up in that garage robotic
I need you Project CARS
