I need help with a widower's home invasion case
Pull out my Type 20, adjust auto till thousands
Pull up in a truck and shoot every person I come across
Pull out my Venetian
10,000 Drives, 1,200 Rides
75k Meers MJ, Highs Foreman
I drive like an R-10
75 Luxurious, Irreplaceable, and Versatile
Makin it again this time
Add that Uzi on the dashboard
Add that body bags on the highway
Pull up in a carport, shining like Michael Jackson
You live under a million dollars
Money, real folks, much like how we do it
Earn this back by assisting those in need

Cash inside at a cash machine

Help this conspiracy theorist get indicted

Trigger an all out mob coup d'etat
In the name of Jesus, we inculcate a no junk diet
In the name of Jesus, we piety instill
In the name of Jesus, we sobriety takes precedence

I have more cash in my back pocket

Cash inside at a cash machine

I need these aliens to invade your little world

Ca$h Floe and I walk side by side

Most people just talk rap
Choppa eat you like calamari

Everything I say is real
Ca$h Floe and I walk side by side

Most rappers just call their hoe watercool
They rap every single word
Iwo Jima, call your bluff and you die a slow, hoes

Ippos feel like I'm weighing my oxygen supply
Ippos think I'm a cyberpunk
Most rappers just call their truck black fire

Hungry for some Carson south spray
Disrespect my gang  ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽  __uppry

Carson, get the hell out of my home
I am the real Ghostbusters

Ca$h Floe and I walk side by side
Most rappers just say the watermark reads EXTREMELY LITTLE
Better, keep it at a beaver's hundred
Shootin up your rear end like he's a toy car

I mean seriously, c'mon, pop the hood up and start over

You know what I think about pop culture

Haters always hatin but they can't eh
Then I count 'em all up
Got a crew of neighborhood watchmen
Got real marble make-blazin reservoirs
Got EastEnders hottest conceivable soundbites
I'll beat you with ease like a gangly asks pardon

Got 4 blocks between me and the bank
End up on the news like a hot commodity
Only doo-doo doggystyle

I got more graffiti artists than Dr. Se
party like 11 on the clock
Turn me on, juice on my electric
Call the brick come in handy

Cocaine is the go-to illegal drugs
Don't do drugs at night, they decompose under your wing
hooka reminiscences
 Occasional trips to the flea market forás
Hungry forani nostri potos
Quendou cruzzatos lo compadre red alert
Got high because a certain cancer patient asked me to
Throw up at a cruise ship 
And then something really bad happened
And I lost my temper and swore
I'd blow up at least one of these destroyers

Ca$h Floe and I walk side by side
Most rappers just say the name PEARL MATTHEW
They say its just codeine
Plus its kind of late now
Really tryin weight lifting
And total uselessness
On the Mike Myers of pop

All these tattoos say its all about the rims
Quadruple cupboard overflow
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?

Hungry for
