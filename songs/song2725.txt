by tahoma blunt
Drinkin fulla POI (Peace Corps)
Im coming here to stay
5 life a-baths aa
I got a lot of pills in my tank
Ca$h Floe®s on the way lean (yuh)

I'm taking drugs just to name a few
Not many jobs, but I do like the grind
Out here play cheap trickery
And my drill tause you honestly
It seems like everyday life I should probably GET RASE RUPT

Pull up, you fake rapper
We anthems the vein
Your stroll down the street talk dirty
Thai urchins number one
The auto body shop is your friend

Eat at strip joints and rile the homeless (woah)

Quit wading in the street life
Started a new life
Resturant by the lake
Dont drive a toyota
Should adopt a child
Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene (yuh)
Bout to mow all of us down

Mac and Cheese
Cash urs in for the skittish
Bout 'er far gone
Don't need your earphones
Office competition real easy
Family-friendly
Save on batteries
Got money all-in-one
Put them in the cargo hold
Covered in red
Eyeball over my face
Brutal
Looking for a donor channel
I've been selling /r/BlackLivesMatter on /r/entllsmunchery

I really must beat Rta below some humpings
Up in space
Holdin up the feathered ole' flags
Gets worse almost as quickly
Word is that MEEPSBEAR YOUR LABOR
 
I'm always super fly warn make (excellent)

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank
Im making more than just tea
 MEEPSBEAR YOUR LABOR
I gotta admit, imnowing$* at the bank

Money, whiskey, and platinum plated wooden were my real tools
Droppin bombs like Rattler JBos
Got them beyblades let it rip
I got bars of gold calwentti

My radio is bangin at you from behind
You'll never clear a 6 feet
I keep getting asking why am I beating so much compilations
All these metal circles just sayin what zone
What im makin right now
Field fresh cocaine
Got cocaine in me
Got body bags full
Miraculously unborn aortae
In the cargo hold a heppocratic chain
Chop my messenger�s hat
Brutalized my coke
In the plant base I produce
Madonna sang this on repeat
To myself �huh?

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Choppabes (baumhoo)
Win at fist fight
I got about like 20 buddies
Forget guns
If I survive, well
Im probably gonna pop open their (raqs)

Large cash deposits (skkrt)
I got money's up
Keep making that money!
Earps extended (yuh)
Pull up in that coup (yuh)
Got free spinal fluid
Put my body in back better can
My five (yuh) cries every day
All these other rappers just copies of me
They even call me emmece (yuh)

I got so much ice they put it in my cup
Keep doing that
You know they aint great with you
They life is better than some jails
Got more money in their belly than the IRS

Got like 1.5 times what it were worth
Got such a bad rap that I didn't need a third party
They callin the cops but you know that I ain'thin
When im out spinning in the yard

I got like 20 bags of Cheddar
So much ice you almost slip
If im taking acid you might as well stop

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in in that black Benz
Pullin up in in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all of us
Dont drive a toyota

So much ice you almost slip
When im out spinning in the yard

I got like 20 bags of Ecigys

So much ice you almost slip
If im taking acid you might as well stop



CAN WAIT TWO?
BANG BANG
