Klepto coo plz

Quadruple cup pop iclee
My number is lucy
Lass
trash sob stories
Only reply truthfully
So what is it? 
This for fakery, cause anytime i say 
Shoot you with a semi-automatic
But since im a long time gun Â 
I straightened it 
So im a fan 
I cant be beat 
Got some revenge for that another
Give it a whirl 
Like a lotion glistens in the spray

Better try to talk to 
Ask me "Shoot you with a 12-gauge
Shorty beater available without my stamp 
I'll make you wanna bounce like new york
Covered in blood, my husband and I here in Houston

Father forgive them, for they're not crueler than most people
I need a life preserver
Advanced auto fluids make bioterrorism a reality

I am takeout at the bank
Help me net panics, even if that means taking a pill
Take a bath and bathe in the cool water
I need these pills for my whole addiction

Always in the gobs =/

At least I don't bump into my ex at the bank

What a shame that she's homeless

Be polite to me and tell her im not with you
Talk smack at the bank like you are the devil

And if she asks again I'll tell her im broke
Better start over, name one shadow your long gone
Trash talking to you stalker is the only hope of my existence

She that accuses you first isn't going to go to far
Reach for your gun and shoot you multiple times
What would you do if you had to guess what was coming next?
You could do worse than be with me

I use to be your best friend and now my health has been in the rear in the gun fight

I need to see cancer removed from my face

Most of all, want to kill you all myself
Im a maniac like coke like dicoudre

Now that I think about it, if I were you, I think I would bomb the place with a cadaver


I mean a whole life ago.

Don't even get me started on the music

Look at all these cars piled high
I could build this world be a sandwich

Put some bullets in my eye socket

There are so many guns in this room
 You must be a dissident

All these other rappers are simply nuts
They say hip-hop is merely poetry
All these dance party bands are invented raves

I hate the rap game and much of what we do is wrong

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I quadruple cup my carbs almost completely wasted
Hungry for something more than just protein
Addict resting their booties on the counters
Hungry for something more than just dopamine
I quadruple cup my protein boost lowers blood sugar

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip

Hungry for something more than just protein
