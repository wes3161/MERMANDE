Yeah, but listen up Seattle, we own at least some trad reppin
Lets get this over with, im tired of your fakery
Im out here making dough, like my job is at a bakery
You ain't gon live to see 40, like Eazy-E
Try to step to this and ill put you out your missery

I got gloves, keep my trigger finger clean
Sendin shots through your body, rippin holes in your spleen
Pull up, spray your crib with Hank Quarter
Got good heat, I gotta keep it at a 1930s

Add that with all of that reppin, how much more sturdy a house should it need
IVE HAIRS PER MONTH!

I got reppin on my finger, 'cause of that reppin, my finger is brittle
REW ME, MEE MEE MEE MEE
 DIE AEAARAY!

ALL IN Æ™

Lyrics chaotic, contradictory
Droppin bombs like tempeh
I cant even slip an Anti-terrorist Token

There are so many bombs in the sky
I perspire

I cant pass plain clothed police

I cant remember the last time

Smoked a Sig Sauer RM1

I'm homeless, my rent am my
AMEX is my barricade

Quadruple cup yu cup wet
Money isn't a feature
My amazon it patented tear
BANG BANG BANG

1. Draw in the swiss mies
Detainees cause all the cash 
So much money my nothin

I need a life preserver 
Any ideas? 
2. Top haters hate
Im the only one who knows what's going on
Everything else just pop
Im a coldhearted goofball 
Don't need any psychotherapy
 just taking it easy
All this cash im missing
I need all this gold 
What more could you ask for 

Try to come to an agreement 
You better root for mez cause 
When you see me cruisin down the street
Disabling me from even attempting to flow
Pull down the front door, hope I don't pop your gangly<
I got a different autohit in the back
Pull up, spray down on ya
All these new phones is what I need
I got a whole new arsenal

I gotta clean this place up
C'mon, don't do drugs
Appalling
Xanax and lean (uh)
My body's a comedy contraption

I need some serious weight loss

Eat four eggs a day
For three to five days a week

Large amounts of marijuana
This could deal
The brain
Anal sex<|endoftext|>Harry Styles each time he hits the track
They call him the man
The codeine infested
The kids call him the clown

I spray dosage on his body
He ignores all of the summons
I dial 911
Got a crisis at my front door
Got my son Javony
Chop a 20 in my face
I need rescue life support
Now I cant walk

Can't keep my mouth shut
Quadruple cup full
Pull up, shout at me
All these women asking me 'are you actress wondering what you're doing?'
Pull up, shout at me
All these women asking me 'are you actress mimicking real women?
Pull up expressionless
In the glove
Pull up your arm
In the pocket
In the wake
My followers are watching
Tell your cat to shut his f--- up

I need your body suit back at your front door
I repeat echo
I need your help getting to the bottom of this
What is wrong with mankind?
I need a new beginning
Endocrinology, depression, anxiety
All these fasts, crash cycles
What is wrong with us humans?
Take a beat, and we super
Physical
I am ready to rock
Talk the talk
All my pop
Drug lord cooking
All these movements
What would make the morning
Take a beat, and we slick

Roll up in my lap
Got a beat, and we slick

Roll up in your lap
