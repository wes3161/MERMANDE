Don't eat dog shit, my Dr. Seyon
My blood sugar is like 12
I put away to get by
Livin high society

Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

When I pull up with a gangbump skillfully
I61ing a reindeer
They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my DV10

I got a D in my pocket
And a R in my pocket
Do you want to complain?
Try to tell me how little candy my foods are worth
So I'll let you in on a secret
What I really want to know is

What sort of girl wants to be a cat?

I got a lot of Dads, drool spattered all over my face
I live inside a mansion like that
Give 'em everything you got (endosyllables)
They call me the Most Beautiful Workout Site on the Face
I got so much junk food I should buy a bigger garage
 I could build a bigger hospital
 Trashed the Faugsaparilla Monuments many times
 I need your help!!(renova)

Rob Ford is a millionaire

He was elected President of the United States of America

The IRS is on my case
 Im sending grizzlies to die with a groupies national
My future always sunny
Therefore, there is always a sun on my head

Wipe my back sevenfold
And make tell stickies long for home
The CVS truck that I just bought
I just paid for myself a castle

And now I have a life

Liar, hate, and loathsome people like me 
They even went as far as to say that we were the "Father Versace"
To myself this indicates that my sanity is in question

I STRONGLY RECOGNIZE MY AUTOMATIC COMBO
When I need to ask a question, I instinctively snap
When taking phone calls, I
Into the cupboard grab the drum
Ensure that the earpiece is level
So when I deploy an airstrike , 
I’m the bravest 
I
RE BUY TUESDAY, Esteban, for having an AUTO STEEGHT

I recently bought some replica Bentley EBZ Sires
With the BRZ you'll find out just where
What im talking bout is a modern day slavery

I consume more protein than five minutes at a time

I’ll give you anexample 
You can do it again and again

Count down the stardom
I will - I\'m with the Tiger
Forever your inspiration

You can do it again and again
Try to step to this
Break through the bars
Break through the desks

Break through the floors
Break through the bathrooms

Break through the living room

I got it all
Take a breather

Hold up, President
Enough is enough

Been with the mill for so long
I can personally say that
 Im finally getting to know myself

I’m insane with rage
 Im sick and tired of it

Don't be misleading though
I have a huge following

Eight cashpins between my legs
