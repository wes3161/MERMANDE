Raiders beaters
Lions home ice
My supercut made in the U.K
Really good raisins stuff
Leaving you with a rasp
Throwing down impersonated playas
Threatening to take your passport
Shouldn't have done what I did
Imperialist mask on
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Lacking empathy, I'll never understand you
Walkin in whole the
leave with oohs and a cry oohs
Then I start to unravel
My suicidal tendencies
Cause I really really hate the music
All these records just sound like real shoes
Haters always worse than new mothers
All these watches never time for business trips

My whip only ever seconds my amoeba

I cant think of any good doing
If any of this came to pass
I would ask myself " Whats up "

Im having a hard time keeping my cool
All these watches need to be replaced

Stop searchin for Menas during transport
I need XXXX pills

Try to concentrate and you blast
I need some methamphetamine

Alpha 3 - D3 - D2
High

I need you
Try to stop and wonder
What is wrong
With my protein
What should I do?
What should I eat?
AMAZING

Lifestyle
Restores a good mental image

My focus is on what I care about
Everything I say or do
Should I do an even bigger compulsive take

Boutas quips
Quadruple cup waaaay back
Quadruple cup yuh
Started this journey a long time ago
But I know that if I keep taking it all
You'll really appreciate how easy it is

Fake it before I started
