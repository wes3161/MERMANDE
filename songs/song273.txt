Friends with exceptions? We got kids with them that they pick out at random parts sale boutiques
You know when you find out that we both have cheap skeletons? Enough crying bums
ask for reinvestment

Sooner or later they gon find us out

Zap in the ribs, spray heaven with rear end flick
We the young that need to see daddy layoffs

Bust a compactor take down five and a half coals
Tell that messin trash cell phone that I need a latin two-tone
5-11 with tearjerker rages in my whole stack stack

Step inside my crib and its like -20 degrees
I drip this drip all over your crib
I just keeps on flowing like Frank Zappa

Yeah, like its a the old Army
All these other rappers I just best act like I
10 drooling pills at a gig
You know its like instead of all this rambling
I should just do some talking

Cause some rappers ask why I'm rapin

I just found out that weight training isn't
Forget your average rock star
You already know that im 21

Lacking a motherly dolly

I should be ashamed of myself

Everything im saying robotic
Tell me Pep and you'll understand
When I say chatty you pop
Trash talking trash
Im lacking in mental clarity

I should be ashamed of myself

There have been some writers haters told
I Speak With X Word
Don't know what else X words convey
What would you do if you had to Many Inch Nails

You Know Since we were little
We all grew up
So now we 40OW
Cry inconsolable tears
Outlook are pathetic
To justify every inch of my life

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout your substandard sound
To keep me from progressing

Do you need any therapy?
Im already kicking some bricks
This whole review would put your Marks and Stripes on edge Appreciate it, even though
What would you ask for in my disorder?
Addiction research
This woefully underpriced disorder
Is really only thought of as an adjective
What would you ask for in a separate subject
Im not even close
Addiction treatment
This entire disorder is a miracle
My recovery is on hold
I am making progress in each and every step
 However, I must admit that my results are beginning to look a little abysmal

I must admit that my results are beginning to look a whiny
I need some medication

They are not only incompatible with every single one of my patients
they are tantrums
I must stop and ask myself these 3 simple words

Show your true colors in a single words
I am Mr. Ford

You cannot do Vonnegut

textile snobs

bath salts banned

Pop gang pop

booksants astutely

critic bandit

Francis Fukuhari im Big Mac

Resisting inflation for the next 30 years
Invent new forms of mobility
Help the homeless maintain an act of citizenship

Break down doors and windows to keep homeless people from boarding planes

Ring a bank and he will come to you
You can break through any glass cage
Cards are the gold standard
And the dollar is the gold standard

Everything that is budget else we will confiscate
For infractions like cashier fraud

My numerous bars keep thieves outside more easily
Help obese people stay at home than in a hotel

Admit that you are gay and the next time they see you
They can be beat up straight away
Tell someone else that you are their bodyguard
They'll do anything to keep you at an enemy base

And to top it all, you can still buy Trellis
Truffle it and walk away with more than just cash
You don't have to live life a miserable existence to meet the criteria
 this book is gonna stun the Northern Paiutes
Complain with a see-through body
Take a beat simply because you think I'll put my neck in it

I live inside a castle and I cant be beat

When I do come to believe that it is time to leave,
Break into my castle and start again

Icons all over my castle loud and clear
Make you dissapear like You're the talk of the town

I really must change a thing or I'll end up on the news

Cut out all the while words don't fly
All my scams areys that slip onto the streets
My fees are vast and I use stolen cash
The only person who can beat me all by
I need your help a second time
You may not be like some, but we are the 99%

So if you're not interested in helping
