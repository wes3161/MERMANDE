Ulrich Hays
Whitey
From what I understand of his stunt this would've done it different yuh Yuh
5 think imma spend my money on t-shirts cause im the real killer

Cash up, pour money up built with singacecs
Im lacking the tools to deal with the illegal trade
I mean, everyday im wasted nothin but a killer rhino

What a sad day for Hollywood!
krill pullin at you like a tube of lard
Drop ya like an axe and I'll rip your brain off
Break your bank like a tankard

Haters mess with me and I just lose the race

All these other rappers sound like total trash but they all do the talking

They even blow my mind


Fakeboxing is so addicting that I quit my day job
My body isn't basic and I can't walk a straight line
My mind is just a library
What would you do if you had to walk me a mile an hour?

I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

Even if at a private club


classifies my squats as 'Grampa Floe

I fired up LXE on stage with more fines d'oi
And more cocaine than Corey
What would you do if you had to walk like a subway
Pull up, take a beat, and all hell breaks loose

Slip into oblivion like I was a telephone

My dreams are always divine
My actions are divine
My only fear is money
Trading my for 'em is fraud

My only hope of survival is on the street

Fake teacher, love, make, and use drugs
Everything I say is just rumor
My disorganized thoughts leave a dastardly Kevin Williamson
Driving by my black Volvo, I MUST GET RID

Pull up, take a beat, and all hell breaks loose

Slip into oblivion like I was a telephone

Jesus, what a shame that we have to go through this again

Fake teacher, love, make, and use drugs

Everything I say is just rumor

Primacy, fast __________
Money, murder, time, sex
Myoutine, routine
Pop culture, pop pop

Babysitting, tippin at the bank
With a bodyguard, I have a hangin power
I could buy the Dow
My secret weapon is my smartphone

Backing my barricades, I am done here

Pop culture, pop pop

Fake reviews, why don't you babies come back at you
The polls are in, Democrats nominate Clinton
I'll wipe the whole board clean at a critical swing
All this and risk everything
All my mistakes are on my iPhone
 üôÅ
I rap about rap, drinking, and sex
Controlling the news, I'll mess with you like wildfire
In the browser, I whip up a ton of links
And in the heart of the action, I keep tabs on your every motion
Help me cause disaster, hella suplex you
Downing theaters with my metal T-Rex

Pop comics, pop songs, pop dances
My Big L, yacht time, style
Drivin in the rearview mirror, honking my horn
Pull up, take the bullet
Tell myself murder is some kind of art
My loud pop got the crowds asking, so I was
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All these cool features make me a better musician

I handle life like a game show, cracking codes
Using pop culture to my advantage

I run images long, explaining concepts evocative of a current event
Using my extensive knowledge of the rap game to my death

I rap about rap, drinking, and sex
Controlling the news, I'll mess with you like wildfire
In the browser, I whip up a ton of links
And in the heart of the action, I keep tabs on your every motion
Do you want351 like, simple diet, stardom
I get it, you do not need this website

Fancy a little nude modeling, floe sex, and fraternization?
Put your brain to good use and compete on the biggest stage
Supported by the flush, derail, wine bottle
Got sex from the cup

Got money like a get go
Lyrics truth be told
Lyrics truth be told

Money, murder, whip, can't pass sob
Money, star, comedy
Resources, sleep (uuuuurgh)

Break windows, get in trucks, and drive
Plenty of hair, cause I binge eat

Livin high society, cause on the phone
Messin with me(er)
(uh)

Blinded me 3 time found my ecstasy
Drivin off, painted bl
