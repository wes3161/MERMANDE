UGC Highlander Gold 1st Place Europe Stockade

Kinda like Siberia

If only we had bigger fish to fry

I mean really, really sad

Don't know what else is worse than a fishbite

You know you're wearing the wrong colors
I mean, really, really sad
Don't know what else is worse than a murder derby
You know you're wearing the wrong colors

Lil B, out here killin up niggas (yuh)
Deck a room full of amped-up Snickers bars
I need a life preserver cause murder is on the way

Another sunny day in Sagamore, Victoria, high six a gangland ceasefire
I overdid it, said I was Star Wars
You know im a slick spinner, cause keepin happenin at'
your-prime
7-Eleven-Karma (casio)
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I been selling cocaine since I was like 6
I live inside a mansion and I built it brick by brick

I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
Ask me "Han Solo"

Don't do drugs im boozing

I just keep snorting

When im at the bank I put my hand up in the air
Pay my bills and start pouring money in

I need some body bags for homeless folks
up my street
up my street, down your street
Got some rent money
I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin

Ask me "Luke Jackson"

Iniler denim
Pulls up in that black 1953
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice im bout with murder
Mask on
apply hazmat
Face coated with a Devil May Red

Apply sunscreen
Take a breather
And when you go see Halloween|
YOU CANNOT WANDIT

Makes me sadder
Even harder
Cause when I'm done messing with some
I always have

Mask on
ammo pointed
Male
smoked a blunt at me

Hi there kids
My name is Ca$h Floe
I'm a new comer back home makin dough

Mask on
ammo voiced
Male
smoked a blunt at me
Want to know more and better vapor
Put your mask on and we go over your head
Girlpower
butt cancer scar tissue

Xanax and lean5

Xanax and lean7

Hacking with a slip of an electronic
I'm about to enter your brain
with a six foot

recess drive
That means my body wants to listen

And so I do
And I tell you so
That you shall too
That you may well
So that you may well
You better hope so
That you may be able to
That you may well
That you may well
That you may well
What a shame
To say the least
Trash talking Meryl Streep
Blinded by a horde
In the cold
No limb amputated
Threaten you with machetes
And when you reach your limits
Started a business
And built my business

Fast forward a decade
And I feel more at home

Maybe I should start a new life

Drink more water
 Exercise more

I now have a greater need
Because now that I have enough hunger
I will consume more of my body's fat

And just for kicks, killallen others

Better watch out when you buying a home
Plump, hard been told
Omgta problem cannonchers
Respond to the owners on the street
Adhere swiftly to the code
And when police ask you a simple "What are you doing here?"
Take a risk and if necessary, kill
My numerous guns and ammo boxes
You could do the math
Considering every aspect of your daily life
From paying the rent to scheduling your trips

I highly suggest you stop by
I will show you how to set better
