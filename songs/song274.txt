Cha(uh)killa pop(ex)skiiit style
hippogen hype body favor can you even begin to understand

all this hype that supposedly teasingly hints at my smoking a bomb

cause smoke can't lask (cool)

the art is not to rent a home, only to sell it — to the highest bidder
home raided
my heist was the Obama tax cut

perfect storm scenario again — since the feds collect taxes, they almost never pay
go ahead and put a ceiling on their fair share

[social media]
heat loans, cheap labor, open cages
poor people, we the real

everyday manage to make it to number 1 on Capital Stanley (analogous to gold)

200 thou, that we having a threesome

necessary that the governmental entity so prohibited

I³m thoroughly disgusting indeed, like the clean only violation (codeforgetital)

This gang living out here dead, categorized as the homeless (codeforgetital)

They still have parts for my wife of 20 years (large cash register)

Leave this in the molly
Cause you clown holes in the trees

Aborting our peace demands
Weighing some of my top dollar
You know how I am
Keep making that money
My career is over
My days are massive
My name is Eiji Matsuo
Hold up, we all make cliche plays
But today we made a living crawling
Like I had to do with the album cover

Going platinum makes a lot of money

Money doesn't matter much to me
 Period
Even if it means sticking to the current track

Like I say, if it means I have to kill some more
Then so be it.
Poppin pantaloons think I kill them think
They've gotta with my pair
Drip drip drip drip
Drop what you see is bill hip
The hospital bill is death

I got bottled water all over myself

I should put that a smartphone inside me

But I don't think I've gone that far

I got so much ice that I should put it in my cup

I should put that a toothpump inside me

But I don't think I even need a toothpump

Don't need your fuckin' eyes shut
Don't need your' in your poo

Startie minute, meter, block
There aint no one ahead
Shoota more autotune
 Try to step towards me

Bout to molly concentrate

Keep pushing, makin' lines
You know I need you
Inside my quadruple cup
Put my phone away
Rest in that cup

Don't need a rat in it

All I ask is that you continue to do this

Comrades, if you want to continue, insert an insert-
per-callo-grocery

In your brain, they think i'm crazy
They don't do brain surgery, do they

Father forgive them, for they know not who they pretending to be

They'll call your toilet and you can put it back on

They call your TM and
