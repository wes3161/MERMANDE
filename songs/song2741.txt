They call them the Trumps because they keep saying the U.S.A

We need some serious communication skills
Add to that list your tendency to overthink
Even silly things
Try to mess with me, minimum issue

High on codeine
High on codeine
Add on Twitter, some serious gore

Large party favors

Lacking all the dopamine
Driving around in my black Aston

Quit breaking 'em up, say hello
And by 'Hello' I mean 'cat'
