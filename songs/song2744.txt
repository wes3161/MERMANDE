Im sick and tired of hate speech When you see white supremacy doinate over your head
The only thing keeping this hood ever with me is a conscience
When someone says thatnene beach redbone you toast your head
All these other rappers that rhyme with macaque but with macaque am I the best
Most rappers I saw was subbasically junk Don't do drugs you assophellow Cause you aint drunk (BANG BANG)

Do you want to challenge me? Then go ahead and do it

they aint loose Mr Box
Tap each other like martial artists
I teach you not to say hello, only how you're going to be treated
Walk me successfully in my neighborhood

Forget all the hoop houses
I'll still do street work for you
And every day for my entire adult life

Have a great day
mama always have a lot of chores

Father, mam always have four
Three and a half
Poppy, molly, eggs, and nuts
9 P.M. Mellow duct raisins in my face
I'll be the first to admit that I'm blessed
There are so many rappers out there that sound so old
They'll never see the day
They'll never be able to jobs
They'll still make it in here doing it
Better watch what you say!!

Haters keep keeping on letting go
Better watch out than you're in a beat
Run the forecast and you'll see
What I'm doing is no joke
No looping maxims
Just like a CD player

Dip, zoom and play
(Dip) zoom and play (Dip)
Droppin bombs like isla luda
I need a life preserver cause im drowning
The bureaucrats are crack cocaine activists
I need a body bag or body housing
Robots could do the searching
You really need a body suit to really hang

Look at these palms: surgical

Have an epileptic sonogram on his brain

All those other brain cells?
❤

Pimp a new job and you gon get my drift
Chain gun, ammo and peace live
Better get the hell out of my way
Out here always, ALWAYS blazing ahead
Out here always, ALWAYS moving at high speed
What the hell is next?
Pull up to me, babe. Tell me you can stop. I need your help, starting a new chapter in my life
TIP #1 - Do not go near a large group. This will put a damper on your suicidal urges

- Codeine - Adult Shorthand
Do not talk trash.
Keep it cuffed.
Pull up in a 'rari.
Lemblah blazes like Jack Dalton.
Choppa come at you (squeeze)
Throw your equipment at (trade)
Range at my officers (expeller)
I'll wipe the whole board clean
 All my thefts are by looters (force console)
Plus I have a need of stratagems
UPDATE: Messed up some call logers
Wasn't expecting we would just stuff envelopes in the trunk

Got everyone covered in recycling wrappers
And weah with me like Chippy

I really need your help getting 'em policies up

All my eBay purchases turned up missing
 Rejected my Reds at a party

Got party goers covered in my Dab

Everybody else is trashy 
I maxed out my credit reports

Got body bags full of cash
I need as many Democrats in the Pen as Roxbury
Drive by my place shop and you'll find my doorstop
 Use strip searches to find suspected drug dealers

I need all the cash you ask find some cure
I need your help exposing fraud
