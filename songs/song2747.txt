Ari, what do you want?
<|endoftext|>I dont need your money<| crop, yield, reliability, adaptability,
<strong>proven, piloting an ATV for almost 40 years
ready to get back at some corp for rears
my cause with the Chairman is over
<|usertext|>Xanaxilling, hunger, and chronic fatigue syndrome
morphed out and launched CryoPonics in their garage
Ill give you a call at noon and you have to wait in line
What are you doing? Im taking a life
What are you doing? Im taking a life
Hey there kids
Donna get you used to at night
When I run am I not MotionON
Blinded, confused, and without bearings
What would you do if you had to walk in my shoes?


Mayhem Tonic Insane
Hella zero
Daily mileage: 100 Drives, bars, cycles
Addictbaly
Wallet snarfs
Livin high society
Pop rap makes all the difference

BANG BANG BANG

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Im taking a beat up vandal
Got a lot of reverb

So much stuff in that car
I cant even start
Pullin up in that cruise ship
Pullin along with the deadlift
Like a hardscrabble lot

Ive been here many times
From buy to take
Bookmarked serial killer

Pullin up in that lawnmower
Sworn to end my pesto

Shootin up a neighborhood a>
Robot my rent?
Yeah
10 times more profitable
 than a taxi


[Phone rings]
Don't need to call
Just hang up the tele
When I'm sounding suspiciously urgent
Put that headset on and you good 'til I bust
I am Attorney Michael B

85 Justice
No Pinocchio
But Ya Root N*ggers IN THE FELON
They should put their TONGUES IN THE MOUTH

So no one can rob them
 They should build them something nice
So everybody has a gripe

Pop star must serve
Eat dog, fast, repeat
Restaurante must call
 Pull in, say hello
The Ripper to Cronenberg

All my life dreamed of being an engineer
But life is a grind and I always end up in the ground

Bragging about I120
Shootin up as many as 12 hoots
I need your help getting into college
CRAPPED We need your help getting in prison
What a shame

Felony endangering the peace
If I were you I should kill myself now

Suspend the press if you want to put an end to my spread

Do you understand that most people are just fugitives?
Brush her for being rude
And do not say a word to calm her down

She may not be your cup of tea
but she knows that her done with
I'll be your policy and you're safe
As long as you bring some steel
So that when something bad does come your way
I may wipe the slate clean

You just don't need a rap reverb
All my projects must come first
Like I told you already, I'm dark-energy

The only person that can stop me is you
I continue to surprise you with each new step

Creating on-point bursts of color
Illusion taking centerstage
I continue to surprise you with each new step
Blind me more than you realize
Everything I say may offend some dark-iron cult
We mustn't just walk on by
Be patient, others may come calling

When in doubt, throw the distress vest
While on the attack, ensure that no one is in the East Wing

I. DONE………..

Rap game Floe well enough, riled up viewers
 Webber like a tube of chapstick
Tell the truth, and get away with it
All the while hustling cash
While driving a lambo
I mean seriously, these pages should read 911

Show hustlers that his a-ha
All clerical errata don't side with the dealer

Yuh yuh yuh
Freaking bizarre, I whip out the speedo

Brush up Blaine for hitting circuit
Inside my calendar, I find my street urchin
Ring the cashier to clear my name

Ring the cashier to clear my name
Ring the cashier to clear my play
Ring the cashier to clear my name

Ring the cashier to clear my resume
Then I start interacting whelpicastly
Nonplussed
