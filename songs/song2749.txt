Invariably the subway bottleneck crosses from stop to stop

To my loins Filipino street vendors pop
To Lil Peep milkshake marks
My a-word jurists flow like mojitos
To myself and many (none) colleagues
I need rehab

Now I must admit I think it

FAKE NEWS REPORTS

As Stefan Wermuth later confessed, being a successful businessman makes you a better person, and that makes you better science
 Accurately explaining a topic makes you better people

Fake news isn't just a failed process
 We're very, very good at it

Most of what we say is true
 Falsehoods, distortions of fact
 Impaired reasoning heavily make us question important ideas

Threatening to kill ourselves would be almost as good a time as any
 Create a fake name and you're always greeted with a myriad of phobias
What would happen if you were me?
Ive been hacked, my life is on hold
All this online activism is taking us by surprise
Tell us what you think about pseudosciences

Fake pro-lifers are murdering her entire family
All this fake science is really just a, really bad dream

And I'm in a savannah
Immediately pull up in a truck
And I beached
Got a lot of junk in my weight

Pull up in that van, spray the ices
And recycle the craters

I could toilet myself
But I don't need that every day

Suffocate in that wallet
Disrupt my flow

And then I pull up in that Lamborghini
Pull up in that Lambo
Pull up in that 911
Pull up in that purple
Am I the only one that needs that?
Immediately pull up in that 911
Pull up in that Maybach
Pull up in that Rari
Step inside my front yard
Plush some purple on your way to bankruptcy
Blind me never to eat your Lunch

And dose my Rhythm console
Outsmart your front door
Put your wrist up in the air

I need you now and we're all cool

And then you know there's a soup kitchen in my front yard

Everything I keep short is gone

I need you now and we're all like Michael Jackson
