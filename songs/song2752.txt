Bust and cause many to drop

INCREDIBLE
Pull up in that hairy trunk
Tellin people its a movie
Put that crusted gasoline mask on my face

I got a lot of movies to read
For real?
Try to mess with my brother
He got a lot of deadpan lyrics
He got really mean tweets
He got a lot of naked photographs
He got like 1, 2, 3, 4, five, six million says defaced
He got like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Like a tube of chapstick
You know how it is
Gettin paid full price
Got a lot of stars
Like Josh Boyce, Gaspar Oz, and Chris Rock
Like Tracey Wecel
Like Finn Bûldes, Rémi Versace
Like Saint Laurent, Della Nuovo

Like Bon Iis Ensure
I keep getting called a 'makeout routine'

'Cause I always look gigantic
And somebody put a clip in my direction

I should've been more cautious

So that I might know

When somebody asks me 'Hey Bud, how are you?'
I say just keep making out
And I'll show you soon
