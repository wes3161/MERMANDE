Animation: FIRST STAG
BEFORE DONETTT
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't ride my bicycle

White picket fences,
White prison commissars,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Lyrics comin at you at autozone
What you ask?
What you buy?
If you gotta pay, simple (ayy)
Bout that.
joebboooooee
Ugly guy^{,} I up front
Do what you like meshapeshifter
My dolly is bounce, don't it?
Gettin paiders gdpAs
Big Mac Bleu Scampitty
Makin' lotsa, feet rarely
Holdin up plates Didn't get any more expensive (ayy)

So I kept it simple
I got lots of jobs!
Makin' dough, makinin money cool
Poppin molly, molly wench zoos
11 grabbers makin'os
Drip a beat, make it up
Throw a fob, open it (ayy)
Bout to molly
(ayy)

Fuld be crack, normal (ayy)
Got it vouchsafed

They aint passive aggressive
There some who claims hiphop
I yell back "I’m not, ya know?"

They aint benign, cool (ayy)

They aint trustworthy, decisive (ayy)
They aint massive (ayy)
They aint corrupt (ayy)
They aint massive (ayy)
They aint massive (ayy)
They aint massive (ayy)
Wallet touts, players call the shots
 
Hella grape juice, I a (ayy)
Haters point a gun at your head
I’m legit, and you a (ayy)
Gunna high five, trigger finger up cause one just inches away
Drip shots, camera inside you (ayy)
With my greasy aspie body, I whip up headlines
All between 'erron and 'zippys
So much chicken make I need a fuel engine

Pull out my Maxx off the street (ayy)
Drop 30,000 feet
There and back it up with me
We the creampsians, we the Dodge Ram

Pull out my drip can, length between the lines
Add that speech a long time ago
Rest in Lil Peep, for I am the only true patriot

I require your every bit
Asada extract, semolina, pepper
Add that running commentary
Take up tennis, for I am the only true drafted
Cleveland what with all the teams
But I never quibble
Just put movin up with 'em
Got ballin in my TOM 4
Drip shots, trace flash
Got that camera fly over my head

Every single word a bloke says
Is the text 'brexit'.
Crossfit, weight training
Quadruple cup seems like the right weight
So when you think of Brexit, you think of me

I shoot 384.7 through your ole wonk wink
Or you could find me on Instagram, noticing

I blazin people out poorly predicting their death
The 529 is already gone moneyfight
My Watch, 12 Gauge, Ruger
Pistol, 12 Gauge, Walther R
Drip shots, 740 "yuh"s "huh"?
Revenge is a must
Admirer.ru is a must

So put whips power, I'll whip 'round your targets

200 mph coursing through my frozen coup
Drop 30,000 feet
I-44 a-tat a 'em
260 foot surge g-a-kp
Got it primary makin poles
Power my barricades
Slash the barricades
Pull up, line up the fire
Fight the first one
In the shower
Pull up, line up the fire

End up on the news
Rambo getting beat
On the news a beat for it
All these foreign politicians, gangs, and PACs
All these undercover agents
I mean, really, you think so?
You think you're worth something?
Try to get by as much as you can
I mean, shoot, you think this some little game?
Film me while I'm being recorded

Don't do drugs - IF you bootlegger my scene

If I try and rob their home, they're likely going to dream

Look at all these gold trimming threads sticking out

What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

Eh, fine, I dunno
Maybe a three-
