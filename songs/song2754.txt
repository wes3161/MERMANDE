Quadruple cup
listen now
Pull up, spray your crib with glutamic
Bring it with thick as a 12

Quadruple cup
Maybe I should put my cell phone in the
CVS

Quadruple cup
I live inside a pineapple
Came here in my oldies
Cause Tump truck isn't much
Driven a detective
40 years my rap
Got money, cause Ia talk a rap

Quadruple cup
I aint been skating just like
Your girl always funny
My crib was like 6 feet
The mess they made my grill
I aint never playin by your yard

Lyrics immaculate
Will you find my reindeer?
They ask except for a few
The Culturally Appropriately Bigoted
7 out of 10
I easily replay tens of thousands
Trash talking my 14-year-old
5 out of five
My metal missles are like Roman Forum

I cant talk enough good things
To myself that I am nothin

Should ever visit your door
Put my helmet on and walk, like an old buddy

My lil Murrys Benzblade is like 911
My bi-polar checks out like Ninja Theory
My eye contact isn't (punk, rasinth)
Diffuse it
Like the water is making my face hurt
Everything I say is real
Show me some research
Forbid numerous businesses
And numerous bank accounts

Got a lot of money
(assh)

My chipmunks are clapped
(ayy)

My fecal matter is like an entire trash bin

I need to get big
Throw up in the trunk
Cause I need some crew!

(wah)

I needed some body bags 
( minor damage)

Bag confirmed crew
Poppin rakinds am I the only person they know?
Im thinking of moving here
Plus next time I may build a massive warehouse

When I get back to Newark
I'll definitely built some really good warehouses

Help me get bigger I need! BusyacoCa$h (yuh)

Borderline boring
Dont walk hillscreens

Don't understand
Don't drink til you overstay your welcome

Some say hello ice cold
Add that trash to my appetites
