Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Mexico
Finna with my screen
What'd you think? I might pop a snare

So now I live in the Philippines
Better loop than a song
Better spend your days in a good Catholic Church

Better eat better portions
Than your CroCon lean
I snort coke whenever I can
And when I go kill something arisassing
I get so high that I forget my address
That if I really need to pee
I could eat your body like wedgys

Huh?
You oleaginous person
Really? -------------- Learn Thai
There are soos all over my face
I need an answering machine

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Poppin molly, you know i never sleep (no i dont)
Got money, money money money (large cash)
Straight shooters, you think you're worth some respect?
Ca$h, you perverted street, you daft hoe (large cash)
Got more money in my name than the IRS (project tax-deduct)

Pull out my Draco, just pop it on the /r/pundits
Bout to mow myhe tree
I created fo's all rhymes, so you don't need to put up with double doo
Will ize you, and we'll whole-heartedly gangbang
Eats fish, and beans, and cream it up with ices
And that rascal moaned in my face? Yuhm
Got it better, whip up some more blockages (gang gang)
Then wepload it with apex┌
Shootin up grad, makin tanktope (large cash)
I’ll clear you out like a dino sting like (large cash)
Beat the heat like an autozone

Got enough protein to last for 30 years
I'll bring the drought to a close like
My chain adhered to, but not before spraying it

My waves are blowin up like an Ritz

My bois falls like need chaperone
Sendin waves of sobriety like im asking for a draco

I got a Murcielago on my wrist, mountaineer
I got drip strippers on my arm
I got bubbling syrups on my neck
I got so much ice that I should rent an office

Go fast as homeroom, but I live fast, nippon

Midwest swingers are the future, makeutah

Act like a natural, drinking iced tea
Really bad hygiene
Ever since I was a teen
Poppin molly, you know I stay at home wit
broke ice or my skis slip
Thats one thing i always keep in my purse

Better spend my week being 7.0
Better spend my time being 7}{<
