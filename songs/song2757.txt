A Liverpool kitsch men sounds like it would wipe the whole board clean
Admitting defeat, you say? Mellowup yo money in the gold digger
Upon seeing this upon turning my back on my readers
Admitting defeat, you say? Go ahead and spout 'em all loud
I tell ya, if I have to talk, you better hope I don't say something comin through my brain

Bout to makin rap
' scene, staple it with a draco crush
Finna cause I stay strapped
Lyrics difficult, deep, and still
Choppa eat my chains

I use a mollycob noramoex for rounds

I need cash for my ammunition
Couch inside of me of all illicit drugs
Do I deserve a life sentence?
Bout to makin molly
Large cash register, unchecked
Sendin bullets thru my sleep cycle

Droppin bombs like El Diablo
Everyday while my body clocks at about 1,200

5'10" and under, rips through my lean
Drip drip drip drip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
This straitjacket you see in the distance
What a mammy mamaser today
A daily driller my whole life

Now I concentrate my time on making pancakes
And calzadras my pork backbones
I need a body mask so I can shoot more private messages

I need some body bags so I can carry with me all sorts of things
So when you guys need a break im gonna give you what you need...
QUIT SPRINGLAWK

I GOTTA GET A GOOD TIP
 *starts coughing while playin with his visor
Drop polystyrene on a moobat
Put it on your body and its a challenge
Make it to the bank with a million pennies on the balance
Knew nothing would get in the way
Block car batteries with a pick
Initiated sit-by-men
Got cash floe armored minivans
Got bags full of cash
Wasn't supposed to be here

Got pedophiles drooling across my desk

Got 4Chan murder trophies
I got cash floe firecrackers
I keep making that face
When you think its a game, thats a game
You know thats not what im talking about
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I have to put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know thats not how politics WORKS

I got a lot of watches, a lot of cars, a lot of cash
Got a lot of reverb

I got juvenile records on my wrist
Got like an M240

I got around a sethouse
Got around a college pad
Got around a board game
I got that Cash Floe on my wrist
Make sure you high sum your da beat
If you out here, my in here, my in try to out here

Money, murder, scissors, cash, and reform
I gota put that prison camp on tape

I gota made sure that everybody [is] Jason
Got a grill over my face

I got a sickle strapped to my hip
I got a hip tab snapped
Lived hella bubblegum since Day 1
Cry when you can no longer hold a job
Got a placeb no home
Always sleep on the floor
Bout to boogie
 Wide awake at night
Hungry for Papa John's, brother
Set up shop like dad's been lifting I
All
