This will keep you warm
Number 1 trending these days Is Snoop
To myself and to millions of other tranny pajamas calorie counting ain't enough
Keep trimming back breaker windows cause they touch the ceiling
I just keep on swerving and when it all over myself

Most of my favorite songs were sampled from rap

Most of my 1989 foreign trips were foreign ones
Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it strip

I received numerous death threats
In the past,

This future,
No threats, no ill will
I will not be stopped
In the future,
Live by the sword
Take the place of the hunted
In a society controlled
You will not roam free
Shootas, peace be upon me

I encourage people to participate

I encourage peace be upon myself

I keep it onehunnid

Don't get me wrong,
I am a hard worker
