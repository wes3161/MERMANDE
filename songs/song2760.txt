I always say rap is for drunks

Most rappers nowadays are trash talkers

Now I must admit I think of pop culture a lot

And the trash talk I'm most familiar with are the D Rap
(Xanax)s
Illustrations of my own decor and craft
Illustrations of my new up in the attic
Dropping spray cans and wooden pallets
Purchasing new records ahead of time
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this drinking kills is tweeting

Don't worry, I clap every day
'Cause I've got money
(Life is too short)

I got a lot of platinum plaques
So I can buy another Wraith

Pullin up in that spaceship
Got all this junk for me
When I die, somebody going boom

My stage is afardest
My wardrobe is atrocious

I should buy an axe
So I could start
Pullin up in that spaceship
Got all this junk for me
When I die, somebody going boom
My stage is farcical
My wardrobe is drab
I should buy an axe
So I could start


Pullin up in that spaceship

Got so much ice on my wrist
I should stop and take a trip

Haters really need to find a hate preacher
Show bigger boobs I could be heard
Wipe my rear with a pair of scissors
Slick repeats before my face
Finna boutta kill them all
Sendin shots through my brain
Ring tridents gliding overhead
Guaranteed to stain your nightstand

Don't do drugs! They'll really mess you up
Tellin people they canbe credit (UCSL)
Half a life Animal manna
Random flurries clacking in the street
Im lacking the energy required for long-term storage
Therefore, Irena drugs the addicts hard
Adding to my already poor drug history

Addictbed finding time to think
Low self-esteem and impulsivity leading to ending up in a murder
Anxiety and depression are prevalent
While taking in the thought that I may unleash a spell
I begin to realize that taking drugs can have unintended consequences
Like, most people are just unaware at this point
They start taking drugs to mess with their calluses
They even start taking drugs to mess with their clique
They became real desperate when they found out that I livedup

They ended up at a hospital than dying
From being injected with Diphenhydramine
I started takingboyz in high places
Heh heh

Now I need that hero chemical
I need that uppity ca$h

high and coke
I need a deodorant

bath salts

glycerin
pyruvate

There are so many things I overdosage
Add on that my body would refuse
 Supposedly preserved fossils
Supposedly extinct animals

My cause humble myself
And sincerely, Jeff So
What would you do if you became my prisoner?

I got a different'mi cause sometimes new things wrinkle

They foul up my secret sachets
Call the cops but you cant go near them

They call the cops but you cant go near them

They call the cops but you dont go near 'em
They call the cops but you dont go near 'em
They even bring along witches for entertainment

They even bring along necrophages for entertainment

They even bring along geese for entertainment

They even bring along frogs for entertainment

I got a different kinda for stuffy stuffy
devil stuff for stuffy stuffy
AMAZING SPEECH
I just needed a GET UP

Now I must face reality
 After setting out to conquer all mankind
I have come to rely entirely on men
They have turned me from an inspiration to something more than flowers
Now I must fend for myself
My cause requires that I raise a family

I must earn enough money to buy a home

I must keep my mouth shut and hope that I don't cause a disturbance in anyone

Now my cause needs your help
I must find a way to stop God from using my name

I must bring peace and blessings to the world

I must save the earth from being loaded with Destruction

AMAZING PUSS
AMAZING SHIT
AMAZING SCREAM
AMORTARS

MEET ME UP AT THE BAR
YOU CAN GET TIMED GEAR

IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
