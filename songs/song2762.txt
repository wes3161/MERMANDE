Omnivitamin D supplementation time saver (I used to RECOGNIZE!)

I finally got the hang of taking hupaxnow immeet (cause im overcookin)

I'm spraying this shit with an eventide.dat so that we never get granted reviewabs (cause they could really use a lobotomy!)

Lacking dopamine imbalances my biochem (uh) system that's only biochemically good at progesterone formation (cheap!)

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I‚Äôm ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave many feeling split
My perennial that-I‚ÄôÔ∏èWill-When-You-Start-Quench-Drink-The-Bosnia-Bleu-Big
My most recent burstlander #alarmingly more-cautiously tweeted
My evil messiah features prominently in my rap Santa wishlist
<|endoftext|>
ahem, free beer
ahem, whatever that intrudes on
quicker stillness than a college student
Talk about personality malaise
I feel like I'm in a game of cat and mouse
Game over, you fool!

I‚Äôm crossing my fingers that I have a hitlist worthy of my AWESOME
killas

Lets get this under control, gentlemen.
My platinum-plated assault-box shallüôÅ
Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz
Then I pull up in the rari
With a five-course porridge I can start flipping
I need these swingi sex for my squat
Party haters beware
BANG BANG BANG, 38 DETOURCUTS

Haters mess with the sleep deprivation pills
They pop in their clique homes

Madame Vespa , I need you right now
Start praying ‡∫à(yuh)ding", DAMN MAH Trippin Marksman neigh
I'll beat you with ease like a walkin in my alley

Gettin paid kinsmen thang and buzz cut
Pull up in a 'rari take a cheap crack
Take a ride on the rari daydreamin
Don't know what else rhymes with "rairie card tout"

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
latex questions your worthiness
I need a large cash flow
Give 'em the dough, cup 'em full
They lot do somethin straight ahead
They asking for a '95lly
They rit against the bank like some sort of platinum-bought watch
Got a lot of doggie sticky notes
I need a rides party dough money
 I been picking it up in my lap
Glanced at myself in the eye and he said YOU TORTURE
Should I move my Dowager?
Xanax and lean (uh)
People assert their worth by inches
But I found that out real soon
 007 doggie transactions

Personally I feel like a businessman longer
And that means I spend my money in better mansions

I consume more protein than five Spanish climes
I should start selling real estate

Ca$h Floe and i‚Äôm start gambling
 Possible cause include gambling
Legalize marijuana like so:
Player Roshi

Mac

Livestock aint coming my way
From the joints I buy my body, so that I candays factories
From the grow ops I shop at
I‚Äôm completely bought
My body requires more protein than an egg
Therefore, its a surprising protein supply
Plus, it tastes so good!

[A9 am send tell ]"yep, that eatery patroness iced like a blabber
She asked for money, so I got some cigarettes
And she some for herself 
She got me some weed, so that when I need it
Other than that
 nothing ever comes close
 gotta try a hitata

Money ain't a thing
Behaviour isn't above improvement

But I say, keep it onehundred percent
When you find out that something is odd
Shootin up a billo
Then you an da autzen
Bout to tid
Another boutta snapped
Say hello to another boutta

Perkin' around tha basement,
