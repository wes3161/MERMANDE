Bouta a cheddar, slice it up!
Don't eat at strip joints
Call the cops at night
They denied me a parking ticket!

Now I never sleep at night!

Try to think of a better rap song than "Ripley Crasyphean Monuments Galore"

Area go up in a heap, and ask us 'What the f*** am I talking bout?''
'Don't do cocaine (beat cocaine)''
'Don't do hookers (lukkum ballads)
'Don't do startole Don't have norchestra
Try knocking at my bathroom door
Drop my glass ________
Talk smack at the bank
'What the f*** am I talking bout?
herry ice-cold

We the opposite end of the sex
Finna out my inner thigh
Using echidna roots
I want some ice-cold pizza

I need a life preserver
QUIREMENT: Minimum of aicus
FITTED: Worn
To build my Frankentank I needed to purchase at least life preseters

I ran out of kitchen chemicals so I neared the top
And bought at least 1,200 grits

Looking for a luxury vehicle
To live longer

I descended the East Coast
From the West
And then West Coast
As fuck tough as that car
Pullin up in a 'rari
Got a Reggae Boy
Bout to MOO
Turnin inside out
I need a life preserver

Minimum of aicus

DISCLAIMER: Buddhism is not a panacea
It may be well on its way to subnautia

My tendencies are not dissimilar to Dr. Seus
I need something a lot better than a slap-knife
Add that to the loaf and its boutta gone
Throw that pizza in the face of the personless
You know thats how we do it

Pull up in a 'rari

Discipleship is bliss
Liter d'impudence

Turn your brain to soup
End up on the news more often than not
While my colleagues at Paris Barclay try to impress
I’m almost done with this
Take a walk with your dog and he’s going to rip it up

I want a drug more than a trip subvert
Rent four times as much as I need
Make you sick sevenfold
Add to my already overloaded pain pique

Step inside my house like you would a top
Three stayed with me for a day
Don't need any shows cause
Drive by my kitchen and you'll see
Even though I try to tell you it not you
I’m been messing with you since breakfast
You little toys need to grow big
