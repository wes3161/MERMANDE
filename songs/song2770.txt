CMH! Lean lean! Pike like ole Miss Stark

Drip drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip (hiphop)
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between your eyes
Finna boutta gonna have a drive-by
Tap the trigger twice and you die BANG

Versace Versace Versace
All these other rappers just copies of me
Run the game got the lock and the key
What you fakers need is a lobotomy

AYE that’s how we roll
Wasn’t raised a quitter so i'm never gonna fold
Everything iced got a toilet made of gold
Look at all these platinum plaques I just sold (uh)

Got mansions maybachs chains and rollies
We in the store say good deed----
AH! AAAA!

Hold up, I carried a coup umbrella
With a cup longer than Hank Mills' palm
I went to the bank with unloaded assault rifles
There were no outstanding fines

I would put that nine-shooter up to my neck

Started to eat lunch with a line your co-workers should know
So I went in with the pick-me-up
 And one-shoted Zanbaxy
Just so I don’t mess with the bank

As we credit, I fired up Liquor:)

Then I - Uzi-zack- fu-ggerged
Got a g-d's Garcia Mater and caligula
We in the store say good deed----AH!

Pull up in a 'rari, rip up that -Empire-

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip (hiphop)
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz
Then I pull up in the rari
With my shooters you'll be sorry

My jaw is a-blindin
Like I neverhin’tked aribitha
Funny thing is that my jacking team 
(Ray Lewis)
(expletive removed)
(lied)
(boo)
11 drs, 30 secs,s
My chainties flex
My shift ishiuuuuuh
Got a molly at the bank
I pop that can of Daskey

I aint never play with my snap''

Do you want to feud with me?
If so, say hello to my cup vid
You better hurry up and shoot a thousand words
Put my rims down quick
Shoot yo junk like it was a ...
now you can say that again
Trash talking my clique
All these other rappers think I breathe
They real rappers look like human beings

I prospered at heart from top to toe

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with you get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here since the beginning no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist
Trash talkin stomachaches\",
