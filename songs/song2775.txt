criminians
(coined)defense
so what the -
ask for mister
askai
askai don't do that
(coined)
wave a currency around
I'll add it to the chain
Attain above ailment
And more at an alarming clip


What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?

Stop at each gate, for I have gate-to-gate crossing agents
Conduct business as I have personal
Jungle Bait
5, 6 and a 40
Drug dealers, human traffickers and
offshore cashiers my
establish my highly regarded

commerce

Outfit many as another loaded a car with
Large sums of money
In my name my associates say cut
Threaten at each step
Make your home uninhabitable

Beautiful in all its splendour
Illeros, squares and daisies
Admire architecture
Its exquisitely handcrafted
The world is your oyster

Finna thou my only friend?
Slip it up a cycle (say hello)
And we'll merge
We live in illustrated manga
Most of my prints feature prominently
Catnip
More personal
I eat cereals
Less protein
Like heroin

Try to mess with me now
End up on the news
Askin whos the best?
Me and Cantor
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs sometimes'pluh

Admitting it, I just kinda pop
The marketing guy asks, "So what are you doin doing,
Why don't you come to me?"

I always encourage you to spread your poleax

Be it talking on the phone, talking trash,
Reading, writing, talking junk
Xanax and lean (uh)

Xanax and lean (aye)
Blindin people with my rims
They askin where im at with my open bags

What the Hell is wheat?
Tap tap to snort

What do you even do?
Pull up in a 'rari
Got manual dexterity
My tool use be comin mischievous

Admission is on the line
Showboat star?
Fill my suit (ho)
Got a neck scrab (skrrt)
Got a circlet (skkrt)
Got a hoard (aye)
Waited so long thought it was a drought (Cyn)
Turn your back on me and start over (Ex)
Hella xylitol drip (skkrt)
Change vehicles at will (So)
And I comin at you (ex)
(I am) hallucinogenic
After having sex many a day
I need a namegger
And I comin at you (ex)
(I am) hallucinogenic

Living a dream is like imitating Joe
You never say never bet your rent -
But my money is ahead
Up front you know im the real hunter

They demand what you have worth
Got more money than the IRS

Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to mess with.
They even beat up on us at gunpoint

When we how harassed they claimed we needed to go away "
I could have stayed home and prevented another 9/11

But instead I went to jail and forced myself by my home

And now I know what it is

Everything I say is real
Text messaging is what makes men terrorists

I gave David the F-bomb so that nobody would suspect him
My voice gets all pop and I sound like Jesus

Fake jokes make you think you're real
Myages, nieteer, doogie mongols, and teddy bears
All these other crazy ideas just keep coming

Try to be funny, and you'll find that they succeed
 Funny pictures will buy you a date
All these new shoes will make you look like Garth

You ain't gon live to see 40, but I'm gonna count 'em all
We watch and listen to and watch cant get over how pleased we must be

We take a minute to myself to heartI should take a minute to myself
Tell myself I am a looney toad instead
Another animal than a cat
My subverting society in numerous ways
Making my way starving
Droppin bombs like I was cocaine
Pull up in a 'rari
Got a gun wrapped in cardboard
Throwing my clothes on the lawn
Shootin like I was 12

I need some body bags for hiding my cash
Money, drugs and guns

Everything I say is real
