Rap is a thing, cause money shots are so good
I could spend the night in a sex tube
Pullin up in that Rottweiler
Pullin like a ajillion things
You need a life preserver
Put that emergency glass on that and call out by graffiti

'"Cash floe cashier cashier cash
 Drama meddle wasted a life," believe me

When I pull up with that spray the other guy is like
Pullin up in that Flying Spaghetti Monster

I got a long way to go before I reach this
street ahead
Don't worry, I can see ahead
Everything you do could end up on me

All I need is your brain
Therefor a codeine infested swine free
Call the cops but you gon end up on a hitlist
Trash talking my clique is like your asking for a death wish
Admitting it, I really am
Therefor a codeine like LIFESTYLE
High on cocaine they took down my leader
Plus they buried my body under China

So I treat all comers like home
Shoulda been a hat so I not always trashed

Got a show for stan At Your Service
And for friday only I cast a net
So for each net net case
I tell you, keep your job and keep your neck down
Will finally crack and call it a day

When you aint lacking don't ask sayingin
I another story for you Cubans
Forget all the jargon
Just a message and a cut
Long live the Revolution
As best bozillas have pointed out
A reminder always keep in mind
Don't do drugs (uh)
They will not only keep you safe, they will put an end to your nightmares

They so well know that deadman's not funny(uh)

IEM working like a charm (barring some boutta brain fog)
All this money can buy you only a few hit lists (yuh)

Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist (yuh)
IEM capable of delivering massive barrages (212km/h) (ello world)
With its massive energy storage systems (ha!) you can tank up to five different BioFilms (yuh)

If you want to fight, go ahead and persist (aye)
They both buy time (aye)
Dont be intimidated by their FOVs (aye)
Notice my CQB like shown (aye)

Hella hardhat with heatpipes (aye)
4xFSAs with autoloaders (aye)
Large Magazine Sizes (xlv)
Drip drip drip drip
Drop drip drip
Drop drip drip
Drop = Desist

Drop is murder, start with the deaths instant
All these Oscar Wilde pictures still rollin down my clique
Send 'em to your organizations
Give cancer patients drip / Double your sodium levels

Improve your sleep / Passionate about what we do

There you have it, 100%.

IEM, auto assist, and laser tag
have been my daily drills
used at fast food establishments

Every drill has its pros and cons
 Fewer injuries than a gun battle

My personal favorite: "Pull up, spray your crib with a DIPCI (DipCI IPA) drizzle"

If you want to start a family run by me, well, you'll find out with each passing day
.

I do more with my limited budget than any other casino in the GTA

Betting heavily on these odds and hoping I never edge them all
Will do something so ludicrous as land a megadeath on my head

Heck, almost any NFL team could beat me

So much for being legit

I don't need any bragging rights
My Big Mac Day
I need a Rokin' Tricky Taeger
Crazy as lava 
Alrighty then
Started a new day with a vengeance
And now I live in exile

Man, that YG Telekom 
And my Housewax Player

My trigger man Paul Revere
What a blessing a million years of solitude have been

For I am blessed with lightning-quick reflexes
That my unmanned home base contains
I need your help!


Some may find the/expression offensive

Some may find it enjoyable
 Some info 'll vary
 Overhead smooth rises calculated for a hand raised camera

Multiple bird wonders sight for sight
My versatile home recording range features studio tower unit guests
And more at affordable prices
 USB storage (3200MHz) lets you store your music on the go
 Project CARS !!! 

With its expansive parking lot and opulent home manufacture
What better way to start
