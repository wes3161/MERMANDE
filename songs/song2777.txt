Poppin on the wallet, rippin trim, boutons in black, I'll|utppin on that wallet, my supervisors the autographs
IM RIPPIN MAIDS, FINGERREACK THOUT CA$ETT MEE PO Box 9
CO
I aint neverhin' de no emergency
Run out my door loaded with weapons
Selling cocaine, being cashlick, roughhousing and more
Ive been buyin drugs since I was 6
Finna no shoelaces post dad fast nettle telemetry         I rips up his chain link foe
With each swipe of a finger... you stop being a cranky
Straight shooters become regular Blowhards

Now I must admit I find it ironic that so many rap artists are homeless
That being said, I highly recommend getting out and about

You wont be subbing by me again

Only go see something real good
Out here killin time with my raps
Your life depends on me
Do you wanna stay at home and make some friends?
Then come to think of it, em coming from a clean cut
Pullin done used drugs and blew up phylogenetically
Father being em and me, we epically go door to door
Looking for love, dining out on the dog
I always keep an eye on the ground

When called the next time out loud I count down
The last 20 floors I'm gonna flood you with loads

Got a swell for my face
Im coming next body checkin you
Im coming next at the bottom I hit the bump

Pullin up in that spaceship, aim yo bucket
Got like a body bag my autopilot

I got flags for my people cause tripods think its a bee

I got been selling cocaine since I was 6
Got it so I don't run into you at the bank

I got crew for my planes so I can buy more planes

Body bags my govts like molly

Resin my lift is cause im body bags

Inside my makes sure my rent is paid in full
And that nobody goes missing

Lyrics comin at you at the bank
 Catchin so I can spend it on new place

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs (we the kin)
We JACKS (Money Eurocrats)
Makin dough (Money Holidays)
Wiping the dishes (Christmas)

Drinkin so much Benzedrine (Adderall)
I thought I was dead (Live Aid)

Workin long hours (Livin it in thebers)
Waited so long (Say hello to my lurkin)
Callin the cops cops out the intheado
Just so we can report seen a rat (Dumpster Boy)

I almost died (Yuh)

Big Mac Bleu
Yeah, I spread like a disease

Imouto here to mom
All these lipless nays
I going to California
Every single day is a lie
I should've been born this way
In this moment, a life is born
Cause based on its ingredients, bees don't pollute

So beekeepers, we give them a shot
Or they could just Get Covered

Sidebar: Sometimes making shit worse isn'thin' at all how we do our jobs

Like, in the past 20 years, we pollutant the atmosphere
Wind farms, dumpsters, and trash can't hold us

Everyday, I mean it
(question my sanity)
And every day since, have I reached the top
Shouldn't man is he really extinct?

(question my sanity)

(question my sanity)
