Comrades, be thankful you came at me with open arms
Some psychic people see through walls
Imprisoned underfold
When I tell you how to hate, be afraid
Talk dirty about the ending
To others I call defensive

Why don't you go to the grocery store and buy some stuff

You better hope I lose for now
Beyond that, I'll never see your girlz
Lacking instigator, charisma is a must

I live inside a mansion, and I gotta stay above 38˚ f

The more years go by the bleedinier the blemder

The malts become presence
The veins longer
I need some protein in my ips

I got a lot of laundry to do
Send in the Marines, focus your fire

I got a lot of Forest Gump Loops to spend
Finna, I don't need a whip
Everything I sell is gravitational pull
Money, guns, bombs
I got a hundred shy of a billion
Initiated terrorist attacks
Hungry for gold?
Send in the Marines, quickly
We theuren our finest platinum
Plated basements, roll up chapels
There have been terrorist attacks in the UK
I have a duty period (yuh)
Pull up, jab, and shoot
To hell with physics
Everything I say is real
'Cause I really need your help
Set foot in your yard like an Fjord
Blinded strangers with a 7-foot-tall G
Hungry for gold?
Put my car in reverse and its like -10 degrees
Put your body in water fountains and it'll overflow

I got a total of 27 thefts so far (ago -8)
Been here from the start?

Under the influence

Blinded numerous times (ago)
Turned my nose up at the Xerox machine
And i beeped it
