Shootin up yo squad car
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im about to drown
Pullin up in that spaceship
Im trying to mess with my dad
But he keeps talking
So I tell him to stop
He starts talking smack
Then I tell him to stop
He starts talking dirty
My bag is full of pills
I cant think of any words that describe just how bad bull—-er they git
I got a mepecac oatmeal here and there
Drip drip drip drip
Disposable, loved the life im missing
Messin with my crew\", messin with my people
So much water im drowning in my yard
Shootin up yo squad car

Pullin up in that white Ghost
Pullin up in that cruise ship

It makes my headphones go beat
Can't talk trash cause I stay strapped

Fake mustache
Pullin up in that spaceship
I got a lot of snapdragon
I got reverb
It makes my wrist bones flex

Pullin up in that spaceship

Pullin up in that spaceship
I got some gold-plated pantyhose
I got reverb

I just got the phone
Call the cops but you gon', already be messin with my people

Gettin go fast and furious
You know i never sleep
Deep in my subconscious
Ill put you in fear

When you looking at me from the car

Three time movies need to be recharged

Three different cars need to be refinished

Pullin up in that white Ghost
Pullin up in that cruise ship
