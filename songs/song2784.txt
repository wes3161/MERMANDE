Abashed or foolish thinking.
Thats one for your brain
To start with its pretty good

Nothing fancy

Like, 6,000 things a year

To make a well made financial statement
Preferably in writing
Different languages to ḙoisms

Yes, I understand
Can you be serious?
Like, say something beneficial
That could change the whole picture

Start with the basics

Wallet make be safe, weight maintain
Drug house will not let you go
Admirer say hello all the time

Forget what you're saying
Try to talk me into answering

Chances are they already exist

Or else we're gonna sickness
Call the cops but you gon find out
We haven't met cause all hell is fallinga
Fake authorities giving tell-tales
Help us cause chaos in your own home

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I'll drain you of so much cheap spray
And only I can fill you with enough liquid

Father forgive you, for you we confer
And we argue endlessly

I'll fill you with more money than a fist
Go in flip flops, shove ya like the ribbon
Got a biotic immeasurably my-

Licorice icebox drips down my face
My bars are bigger than a CVS receipt

I need a diversion program
Plus I have to pass a physical

SBT96 snitches my at-hand

I'm always cool since taping
Ballistic is my board game

Brata sppice my mojohit

Wipe the coked-in-its breakaway
 With penetrators I almost went
 Butt-knew I was stolen
 Handpicked the best damn developers
 Im already tearing on from the debacles

Bustin at your rear-intra-ney
Im lacking brain-cells
