I need a rifle bigger than a mane
Shootin up Mother Nature and her spittle
I need a body bag bigger than a crueller

Put some ducks in my place and somebody else
And watch movies

I need a life preserver with field cleaning
Add that to your needs
I could build a massive park, crisscrossing the Big Mac
And look at all these dinosaurs floating in the distance

I could build a super storm shelter just like Big John 7

Always keep in mind that there are hyper drugs in success

EPIC PICTURE WIP

I just bought a yacht and am gallivanting around the bow
I am drowning in the cash
Money, gems, and platinum-plated stowaways
I just sold my apartment and I need a life preserver
I need a body bag more than a crane
Shoplifter spend money on things I don't need
Everything I need is inside my waif
Always lookin fresh fence - EIGHTEEN

Got a lot of reverb strapped to my ears
Cause I keep on running

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

I got a lot of reverb strapped to my surround
Cause I keep on running

Pullin up in that engine
Pullin up in that trunk

Pullin up in that car
What the f—
F*ck get down here and fight
Im making you sick by believing in
You & Me
