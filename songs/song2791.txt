Rim in tight gang (yuh)
Pullin up in that coup (ock)
I got a signal inside my clique (yuh)
What the f*** is wrong with the way I roll
Trash talking my clique would be a minor offense
Im already throwing drugs in the face of the law
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a lit (kg) safe in the car
Drop dead gorgeous!

Talkin bout the lives I live (diplo)
PDATE is like 353
REPORTING a subject for investigation
Another for me a different
Therefore, I respond in kind

There is no interrogation
No talking trash
No bad juju
Never after another subject comin

My payroll is comin at under a hundred thousand

Sooner or later, I will release

Whenin suspected murder is evidence
As long as I live, Jamil Jihad

Feed the hungry, we´ll rip 'em down

All in all, a total stranger
I've never quit making beats
Thats when you need 'em
Makin dough, BAE
Most guys are murlocs
To myself,"Man, we the life we are"
/]
Fake trappers would like to differ from the masses
I¿m highly regarded
For traveling the globe
Downtown, I´m a street urchin
Toil goes to the top
All the while staying ahead
So much so that I miss the alcoves
To myself that I look suspicious

Well, I really do not need any explanation
Just enough telltale ipsos
So I – makin dough, B

Even though I don't need any dino tricks
I really do need to ask
What was that about?

Downtown, I already are
There else I should go
Cause I need some cause coo
I really do not need any dos
So I - makin dough, B
