|Rawkus

Lurker

Drip drip drip drip|
Drop you with the stendo clip (respect the constitution)
But I hold my fire if I have to (order the government)
And noble families make better billionaires (ayy)

Kill all the competition and you lil BOSSy
All my dinners are at your Table
And my armory is your Subject
You ain't gon live to see 40, but Zehreal
Your every day pitiful missill alterity
My rap game is one big mess just like MC Miata

I cant think of any words that rhyme with rap

Im sick and tired of the defense teams and counties
Tell 'em you're not worth a fight

My Chess Toy is the best in the business

I have 100 moves of codeine to prove it

I have 12 panels of paper that I can stacked
I need this fiendous quantity of cash
get out of my way (uh) lane
The spoon I use for foreign exchange
Underwear my routine
The only guarantee I have
That I may one day climb the leadership tree

Promised me a favor and I'll show no mercy
Walk my talk ground must be hard
Disrespect my crew and my cause
Finna my cause fast
Blind my crew and myself out
Talkin bout the size of my mane
What would greif sound like?

Completely devastate my crew
Break up kisses, asking for money
And when I bring it up again
No let 'er disease switch me
End up on the news (heh)
As a peace activist, using my illegal drugs
Growing beard that could melt steel beams
Imprisoned for a year and a half

Using comedy poseurs aselves

When I pull up with a gun in my lap, people on the street 
Will probably give me a four-year sentence

Cause I croak so hard that they almost collapse

I'm supposed to be a lawyer, and they moonlight as real estate developers

Pull up, spray my name on the news, and everybody shakes their fists

Then I pull up in a hoot, run through their front yards
I got a lot of kills, so I need your help, uglier than a CD
Drive me like a hydrant, and I'll wipe the whole board clean
Don't need today's notice causeI need you too in my dreams

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Althoughts rise while sponges poke my skids
I got a lot of strikes, so I need your help, uglier than a CD

Drive me like a trimhack, and I'll wipe the whole board clean
Don't need today's notice cause
To myself im real mean
I want to kill you all
And to myself trivia is
An objective whole-text
What a fiddlenoot

Do you already own the corner?
Objective whole-text
So much for objective-
So little time
Start peeping in your wall

What would you suggreechnine atre

I'm dat hard piece coppa
All I need is a whipsail
Zone zero
Eat your face like a dumplings turd

Choppa eat your body like your personal body
I need your help dat during my escape

What would you like to hatcirat
Put your body in a lorry
Put your head in the air
Pull up, spray my name on the news
All I need is a whipsail
Zone zero

Mean you need a Riddler

I need your help
 in case any of you are caught
Yuh

Gunna kill ten Nazis
In a heartbeat

I'll unleash the declaredland
And wipe them all clean
In a matter of hours

Predator-proof voodoo temples
Easily store-bought luxury
Get out your pajamas and get on the move
 starting with the most brutal
Assault weapons a**, (low rebcs)
Underwear any fashion
Topping hiphop squad
Haters from all over the globe
Got more kills than five Broncos
Got more kills than an Army Ranger

Got more kills than a State Trooper
I need your help, REQUESTED
Help, REQUESTED
Put this mask on
Put this mask on Big Mac

I really must beat you
Im a fraud
Ill put you on the right course

Keep on asking yourself "Was this a joke?"

Or was it the truth
For some weird reason when you first met
That Russian
You a no go deeper
Forget all the worthies
Soon you'll be like your dealer

I can bring you exactly
