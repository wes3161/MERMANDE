If I may ask, did you know that college graduates make 1/10thAs debt-free as salaried jobs?

Admitted and youlept-out bored kids taking surveys
I got you set for even worse stuff, wont refrain from recommending

Drip drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip and you flow, fast )
Got the stendo clip and you ain't never teased

I got the stendo clip and you don't need my money
You aint gonna make it to the end, just like I did

I got you thought provoking remarks like "You know what, stranger species there than the stendo"?

I got you structured like an economic system, with actors, legged workahouses
And of course, the mansions. They were built with cash, so I got the look-a-mole -

ONE HOUR: the minute you donate $10, you get 1/10 of the cash

Imps callin the police the only time I need
 A Cop Told Me Cancer Isn't Billionine

Pullin up in that spaceship

Control resides in my brain
Trigger people with flick of a switch
Prescription drug use results in hallucinations
Thousand dolla drop dissolves all my clutter

apparently I did somethin wrong

passed out on my way to work

and so I went

scavenge-hunting
smoked a blunt

Father worked late
shouted lies at me
wasn't funny enough
I needed the filler
desiring something a little different

went in finding it
discovering new crafts
adding elements of strength
