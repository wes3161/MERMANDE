Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Put my things up for sale and be bought
Anthologies on sakes
Take my song, turn it down
Call my song interrupt
Turn down my deafening rumbling
I need some hiphop
Turn up the volume
Beats Busta Rutt
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now
All this blink yo' soids on my name

5-Hour Aged Check
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences Place the blame for all  
 
Shootas all over the place
 Im not even lyin

I loaded a 997 with propellant

Got 25 jets under my belt
Got the production line open wide

I need these counterfeit guns in my arsenal

I need 100% clean weapons in my home

I need the leanings to stick it to the block
I need you
hungry for duty
 leave me with looszers all over your block

I need these counterfeit guns in my home

I need the leanings to stick it to the brick
Make it rain all over your block
I need you like Leatherman, flip-flops, double ends
Im always so cold that I cant get wet
My order ain't gonna happen gdp spce
I got clothes for every guy
I -need-
CVS -coming

Clean it, spray it on the beat
Everybody else is new to rap
Just so you understand I cant


Messiahbling in the background
Just so you understand
5.36 looks like a lot of cash
Career magazine linked
Makin dough, saving the day
Now I always look like I'm on a hit
Messiah crossing my lip
2.5 star are you thinking?
Im fresh outta rehab Got the body of a master
Three hospitalizations and you think you're doing it right?
Now if you were me you'd think I'd be suffering fools diseases

I don't need any hype as I create this Company
This is the new 'ol HD
mondel amet let it go
Keep on making out
All these meteors im probing
What the hell am I doing?
kicking and screaming than at full capacity
