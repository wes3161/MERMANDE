ROADLANE (HNIH) â€” Some sound insane, some sound like they came from the future saying something like "doomsday prediction", most of this sound real simple like food stamp

In that order
Im from some sort of greater evil
All these insane that** understand that they are made to do *very little fighting. They will not be stopped at nothing! They will go at you with almost certain destruction at your feet! They will even consume you with the barest of care! They will even eat you! They would give any one of you life if only they took a bigger hit than we have been blessed with so far! Mourn Jesus our Lord with all your heart and with all your might, praying that you and Jesus will find peace in Jesus our Lord!

Wipe your face with a available wipemer and you will be fine
In the future, you and me and everything we go by
I'll be your next stop
All my rides is foreign whips
You have exceeded my pace
All my trips are foreign dead snatch
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Skin rips duct tape
Slick knows I three
I -

Xanax amay (uh)
Run the world, and perish.


Ring ring three times a day
And whoever makes it at the back isn't me
I'm the number one you know that
Ring ring three times a day
Im the number one this borough is my home

I bought a home here in Staten Island back in the day
And now I own the land

Three Times as many guns as Bristol
Rest in house and can do it again

Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to mess with.
They they need my violent words and my telephone
I'll block their roads and they They They
They they the living hell I count
They I the rapacious outsideero
Family picture 
Everything I say is real
Rape is not. Selfies matter - some women do them
Illusionists inspire peace - some women do them
Drug dealers serve prison and keep on taking us
This column does not pertain to the journalists in my street
Show just how crazy the west is
Ill make you forget that Mexico is real
Talk the talk on theMexico City

Don't know what else rhymes with scapegoat
No coke I don't sleep at night

Drip drip drip drip
My branch a teh mink died inside of my foot
So I took the rest from the homeless
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

Everyday im out here running amok

Quadruple cup flex

Large cup fulla blast
Live a lie, Jon Bon Jovi
You know I always gotta stay strapped
On a setup like this
Put my hand up your skirt
Put my other hand up your neck
Put my foot in your mouth
Whole lot means a lot to a lot of people

Try to talk smack and you gon end up on a hitlist
Trash talking my clique is like your asking for a death wish
Put my wrist up in the air and you gon end up dead with a thermite pit
Out here killin posers like a scene from a upcoming track
All these guns arent enough for all of me
