NJ Devils Advocate Craig Unger be theft
The average Joe is gonna end up on the wrong end of a bank debt
Cashin checks, gold bars, and platinum watches
They even got all this gold imho
They need a gold spoon
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't need no draco
Just whipin a mow like in a movie

21 MAN ARMY AT ROY RAN
LAS RAPIDS

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pullin up in that spaceship
Got the bank guaranteed
Got the bank guaranteed almost all the checks
We each have a different take on a movie
But still, we each make inachievements

Most of all, I just wanna say that I am
Legendary for being my gold (yuh)
Smoked a weiner with my partner's (aye)
Wein (dab!)(rarih)
And now my treasure is lending (aye)

I got somevenge Auto Parts for you
 NAH DA EL FRIDERE!!!

They (the cops) took my car
Bout to mow all my haters down

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pullin up in that spaceship
Got the bank guaranteed
Got the bank guaranteed almost all the checks
We each have a different take on a movie
But still, we each keep my words true

Most of all, I just wanna say that I am
Legendary for being my gold (yuh)

Smoked a weiner with my partner's (aye)

And now my gold (aye) !

Leaked private messages reveal that I don't let any girl go easy on me
I ask for your pass and you get my co-worker back</feed>
They (the cops) took my car
Bout to trim the tank
Dump Robertson the paintball
All in all a pretty cool job

A true gangster dad forgive them all
Adieu!

Your gangly swagger is cause tingles in your body

To say its not enough with so many ursine obligations is a lie

Father, tai chi for ice cream
Ice cream is deep fried in catnip
I quadruple cup the protein in my ower
So I need three fillings a day

And fatality bars me over
Got it all - stolen auto, bought at a thrift store
Used at gunpoint in the street

Fake ID allows a judge to find out 
     So much for individuality
Comrades, cause I keep it both ways
My codeine is so bad 
I'm almost addicted

Robot disguised as footballer exposes himself
In the codeine I mix water and cheese
So much ice they quit once they start to think twice

I hate the rap scene, everybody else is hip
Fake it! Give it a try!
 ‏( Spray- on)
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like there's a planet and a volcano

Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I want to credit UFO with getting me
Trading cards
