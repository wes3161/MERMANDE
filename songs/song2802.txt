Here at Sprout Brothers (once something cool like the stock market starts to go up at a really fast rate) I bring you the fact that the more money a company has, the more money they earn. They even paid a top IRS official to look at their illicit money like here's how it is

To: street help
Franklins always ask if I have a permit

questioning my culture
using slang
undefined words
I think most people
expecting my honesty make them think
they're being legit
They like me because I'm 'round the bush

They really don't need any reverb
Fallas, ask any of you
ask 'em where im from
I'm sorry, my name is Instapundit

And im roguish
Gets more expensive the drier
They ask for your songs
and im gettin restless
Rest in Lil Peep

Thats a the pizza
The needle
The whitewash
Pullin up in a 'rari
Shootin up in your front yard
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all around the house
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now
All this blh blh pop
Money, sanity, and goodness
I need a payphone number non stop
Cause I need a number that'll pay
When you calling callin me the real bitch

White picket fences, Catholic hospitals
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

I got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

I got a lot of watches, so I gotta get somebody to tell the IRS

Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Lamborghini
I got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates
I should build a bigger garage so I can always bigger
I wanna end World War III
Take out the best in my class and end World War III
With a snare-ratt I could rip every living fucking thing
I walkin up in that Lamborghini
Like the top is surrender
Top is machinegunpoint
I could write the entire East Indian
Rules the Tanzanian

I want an America first!
Im sick of all these foreign invaders!
Welcome to Grand Theft Auto V!
I am the envy of the West!
Hottest in the East, North America, and the Pacific
Starting from my current home in Mineta
Im grinding as hard as I can with my hacked life

I am trying to become the best atleast 1,000 points better

I need to stop being lazy, I need to get down to business

I am calling in all these psychiatrists trying to kill me

I need a body that can take me farther

I need some guns so I can start taking action

I am taking out the bad guys head on
I need to stop this from happening

I need a body that can deal with my every need
Starting with my most hated habits
Finna x (uh) at reptillology
Setting all my fears at rest
Blindin people with my immaturity
Thinking big and taking risks
Causing real pain
Wasting my money tellin people I'm a fraud
Giving people nothing but bad breath

While on my best behavior
Most shop windows up in the street
When I go inside you like the jus in your cell
Don't need your mind damaged
Walk up and fix my ceiling
Slap my face like Im tired of your money

Now I need to think big, loud and genuinely mean

I need to start running

I live inside a mansion and I cant put it
