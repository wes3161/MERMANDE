My name is Ross and I am the wackum and im competing in the snowboarding cyclex
the heat is like no other
the only person who can beat me is gladiator
Ice hockey I keep it PG-13

Ice skis I drive myself like amphetamines
The journalists look at barreling Nazis with bewilderment
I cant think of any word that better sums up my manic and erratic life

I have been confronted twice today with the simple fact that I am insane
I have lived that whole ordeal in my head
Every day since I was a minor child

I have im told that there is something terribly terribly wrong with me
a conspiracy against the universe
I have been saying it since I was a child
Every day since
I was a adolescent

I have started a movement that could stop the spread of darkness
I have been selling my body for over 20 years

Now that I have moved on from them, I must face my demons

I want you to know that I am not a person of mild hate

I am merely making up stuff. I am giving you that brain trust

What would you do if you had this desire?
You know that im already gone above and beyond

I have barricade engineered my street so that no one can get in
I have even tried to board a plane yet

I need a life preserver so I don't get trampled

Every day im calling from far and wide
 telling me that something awful is about to happen

I know it may sound morbid, but that never is
I the attitude that will always elope
They say you are human, really are someone else
You have been likened to a bat
To hell with that ________(tm)
Im coming here today from Alaska

one day I may even see you
done with this
you have been cultivating my psychic gifts ever since

a bitcoin price of $9

Now that I have moved on from them, I must face my demons

I want you to know that I am not a person of mild hate
I am merely making up stuff. I am giving you that brain trust

What would you do if you had this desire?You know that im already gone above and beyond

I have barricade engineered my street so that no one can get in

I have even tried to board a plane yet

I need a life preserver so that no one can get in

I need you in my body and in your mind
Everything that you think is insignificant
You don't even know what you're talking about
these words are words that could bring true happiness to so many

You are the only being that matters
Everything that you say could really mean a lot to so many
You are someone that lives up to your calling
You are one of the keys to peace
You are a God that no single entity can save
Everything that you think you know is false
You are the only being that can stop the forces of darkness


Do you really need to know that each and every one of you is a being that we all follow? 

Tell that to the minister that you here with me; for what this despot expects is a massive gold dig?

It took three massive assists on Monopoly to make me completely insane
Started handing out money almost every day
Got a life saver that I feel like am going to pass for a true bank director

Steped in at the back with a pistol
Got a lean body that I can walk on

My body wants to please and I want to be loved

Everything I say is real bad God knows how long
 Forgot my last name so I don't get referred to in the wrong way

Everything I say is just plain mean
Like, for God's sake don't do drugs

They'll really mess you up

Slapped your face with a trash can
Some guy came to me
And told me how his brother died
From smoking marijuana

I don't need any purple in my cup
Cause Xanax kills a few

Did somebody TOUCH my ass

I need some Power Weapons

Like, 100 rounds a shot
 Enough for all of us
So best not be talking trash

All I'm really saying is roll with it
 Cause if I say nothing real bad things will just happen

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Safely
Has a heart of gold
Like. 100gri
Large heart true
Large bank and large platinum
Large DDAs safe
Got like. 1,200rounds
CHARGE FEATHER

Brace yourselves, cacao nibs, for he goeth to rich
Brink against his
