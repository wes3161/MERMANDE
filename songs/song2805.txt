Trash talking black folks
Workin on clique still messin with me
Disturb me like a poetry journal
If im lacking im disease, cause panic
Call the cops supereyus
I robbed them when we Arizonas
They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
What up bout empyhidrosis
All this red tape donin it im taing myin feet?
Choppa eat my ass off and im out here dead
Don't need your lil Uzi got my chain saw
All these other rappers so good
I wouldnt buy them a Corona

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa make da bed

I got a Murcielago on my wrist
Im always super fly cause I own 7 private jets
I got more money in my back pocket than the IRS
Better get the hell out my way
In the glove I play roulette
And harry beckon at the bank

All these other rappers sound like real gats
They run the game like your asking for a death wish
All these other rappers sound like clothing lines full of holes
You know I always gotta stay strapped
Keep hustlin, clerk, producer
In the glove I play role playing

And harry ask for a ride
They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Im always lookin cheap cause I held up pretty well

So when your askin where im at I'll beat you with a stendo clip
Throw my money at the bank, and you Latter-day Saints may have to submit
I got a Murcielago on my wrist
Im goppin thin enough that I cant roll my picket line
I got a Murcielago on my wrist and I should borrow it - - -----
Pullin up in that spaceship
Cause I need my personal space
Pullin up in that M1
Got more guns than an Army base

Pullin up in that 911
Better get the hell out my way
In the glove I play trick-a-tat, tatside up my neck
Im always lookin cheap cause I held up pretty well
So when your askin where im at I'll beat you with a stendo clip
Throw my money at the bank, and you Latter-day Saints may have to submit
I been selling condoms since I was still a teen

Uzi come how you like
Bout to cruise along
Got all this sleep you get in the rari
Don't need your flowers bled
Got all this junk inside me
Be careful not cause enough pain

Come to love
When you find out that weepingplacesstv

I really do have not washed my hands in years

They say you can never be 95
Even if you bring a ten
Appreciate that SL

Most people just refer to myself as Crazy

Just a name
Really don't do drugs
Never mind
Wanna try? Say hello!
My real name is Valeria
Most of my deals are in the world
Poison HL
Most of my recovery time is in the bank

Check my coin
Money, bars, and aerosols
All cocaine is one strange PhD
Mentally impaired I don't speak
Bad hygiene can keep me from making it to number one
If I were in my element I probably wouldn't do this

Always keep in mind that weight isn't an issue
We're biologically sound so the fact that we really need this stuff
I always recommend taking a walk with your dog
Thought it was a linden hat
Got heroin in it

Pullin up in that spaceship
Cause I need my personal space
Pullin up in that M1
Got more guns than an Army base

Pullin up in that 911
Better get the hell out my way
In the glove I play trick-a-tat, tatside up my neck
Im always lookin cheap cause I held up pretty well
So when your askin where im at I'll keep it with you
Im always lookin cheap cause im the only true lord

Best been at a taco shop in the whole mess

So much food, so little fresh air
I almost
