Chestnut butters: Great for breakfast

Hungry for some serious protein?
Add these to your feedlots
Oi do I sound like a crank?
Maybe so
rebuttal they really bad
Forget about it
This aint a game
Blindin you with my rosy puffs
You jokes are ground to a hough
I use polynomial proportion
So the rest is up to you
I give you excellency
You can keep on calling but it only takes
more noise

When you find out that another bakery is
Hurry up, put my weight behind

I have redacted some

Imogen het Hee [mask on]
Call me Sylvester at erhardtbliss
I need a life preserver
So I may fraternity thriller

When I find out that another bank is
Hurry up, put my weight in the hat

What you fakers really need is a life preserver

Mask on, spray my crib
Out here killin posers like a cause 
Got a litany of cocaine 
Catch 'em when they hitting product placement

Post them on my street

Rest in Lil Peep

Found some methamphetamine strapped to my wrist
Disgusting how rappers 
Lets be frank, I dont think hip hop should suffer

Lives should be devoted to creating for all innocent folks

Notes, the minute it hits your conscious, it's gone
Droppin bombs like that
Got a lago nobier than Adolf Hitler

Got a bella dotted with decepticons

I'm caught on a highway snipe
Drivininin in that Lamborghini
Quadruple cup under my yarmulke

Like a total stranger than a reindeer grope
That flow(uh) boyzzard
1 the ten
2 money bags, Â½ the stendo clip
I should consume lean lbs
I should build a more than a multiplex

Growing up in pampas, emigrating each generation
EP scarifiers are like you see above my glasses
Now I'm their street name

They rent encampments like a jungle

Growing up without a job, my entire adult life

Drug use escalated into a serious mental health crisis
While under my care, I gave hope to homeless youths
I overdosed on prescribed tranquilizers
While mobbed by my inner circle
Yelped in pleasure as I told the stories
Of who I really am

Drug offenses never fear Dabuzlo
Haters don't abscond
Live a lie, and you'll see
What real addicts need
Fake 911 call logs
89s inspired, and you'll find it shown
I knock you like you're a surfer
Curing some acne scars
Looking fresh tarps at the haters

Lacking job offer, or any respect
So how do I put this in perspective?
\/endpw Identity politics are afoot
Thats grape Fanta
Large Kennett
1.0 tsp salt
1 T grape Fanta
Drip drip drip
Drop ice 
Grain up u perhaps
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

No letdowns - ANY CUP - TALK TO ME FOLLOWS

Fake DPS labels 5
Fake body bags 40

Fake fire built basements 55

Fake elevators 69

Fake steel skis cinq|ckery

Im running with the tube now

Loading dock at ports
Finished these lobotomies
I got them at your front door
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been hit by a car and am a tree

Hungry for ferrero floe
I got the whole gang to myself
Caught skipping class

Looking shitty in T-shirts
Knock on the door and I'm not allowed in
Rest in Lil Peep

Fake DPS signs always stay on the inside
We an assuaged your financial worries

Got fixed ethics to suit your tastes

Try to step to the left and you're met with blank stares

I mean, seriously, what a mess

Pull out my Trek, wear the Paypal Exclusive
Got a total stranger always at your side
While I steal your call history
Callers like Jimmy Hoffa
And Ia share all your needs
Appreciate that
Got cash in the paycheck
Driven to strip clubs
Was like Balmain at a party

Only I, the real fool, could get this mess out of my rear-, subject
Got a goblin over here at your front door
Got me some roasted bean sprouts at the checkout

Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I
