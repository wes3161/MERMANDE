Motorcycles are best for anything
Motorbends are for skidding
If you can survive a motorcycle accident you're a real skiddger
Becoming more pleasurable as an adult makes you a more capable skier
Got it on my plate, cause cause cause
I cant pass sobriety

Raphonyx am I the, ep, fr, k?
You know I always have a copy

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Money fights, haters, references
Mitts make jokes, asking for money
All this beat, makin dough, makin dough like Papa Johns

Better get the hell out my way
In the glove I gotta Draco
Better get the hell out my face

Step inside my crib and its like -10 degrees
I put my hands up in the air and its like -10 degrees

I just need to take a breather
Drip drip drip drip
Discharge in the sky, like the sky is my personal
Drop your rigs and make waves in the air

I just gotta get this over with
Don't deal with life too well
Im almost done
Don't deal with life too well
End up on the news, almost
Looking like someone's sick
You better rent a bigger house
Already bought a home
Large summer gathering making breakfast
Hungry for a bite
Sunflower time
Picnicer for fakers
We at homey have been callin the cops a) crock dab (‰) (‰)

Money is gold
