Tech Controller (Help Me Husband!!!!!!)

I max out at reverb (help me husband!!!!)
Mix two phrases at the same time(uh)
I cant think of any words that rhyme with ska
The only person that can really beat CM word totals is me

To each their own
Im out here grindin stackin stackin money
All these other rappers just copies of me
Theyre some of the ground always good
I'm cool without infrared and I aint never callin down the chorus

Hit 'em with molly, light your way simpkins

You cant beat me at armory like im BCT

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
 Trading card stock
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They askin where im from and what im talking bout
I just bought a yacht so im the captain now
I got so much money I could buy the Dow
Got the stendo clip and I aint never play around

Better watch what you say fore I snap
Roll up on yo crib and we go brat-a-tat-tat
Thats one for your head two for knees three for your back
Always keep in mind that snitches always come in last 

Blindin people with my massive clique
Going in always gonna be harder than taking a hit
Try to keep track of everything
Making it pretty cause 1946 is a terrible year
Better watch what you say fore I snap

Roll up on yo crib and we go brat-a-tat-tat

Are you nimble, don't you?
