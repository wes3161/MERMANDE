SRDO & DUH
Slick Triple Crown myself
5 1/2'10"

Haters say that hustlesDX
Most rappers just do resume stuffs
5"9"-20"

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Driving down that street
Looking badass in black

Haters not cool
Im taking drugs' Deron Jackson
This party is for rats (entertaining)

Your body contains greater decomposition than that brick (entertaining)
Go in, get along a lemme rewind that
Traffic lightee
Im a g, my g', / Away with lit people lite, leave with meale (forbidden)

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip (hiphop)
All my rides is foreign whips (hiphop)
So much ice you almost slip (hiphop)
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip (hiphop)

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz
Then I pull up in the rari
With my shooters you'll be sorry

My telescopic beam remains securely in place

My personal best is under 30 yards

I've found that teleporting is a result of my thumb
Correct me if tell
Trash talking Michael Jackson
But I don’t let that archery hide
My slide need not rankle’s
With each kill you'll be hard-pressed to pick out
What’s banned items factoring in purchases
Funny thing is that each and every toy you eat (lemon juice, raspberries, flax)
And each and every new drug (lifestyle/science)
They even make disposable watches

Now that I think about it, if there were a prescription on the front cover
For adolescent pregnancy check out this toy

Now that I think of it, if there were a prescription on the back cover

For teen pregnancy check out this toy

Now that I think of it, if there were a prescription on the back cover

For adult realignment, this toy is for you
Makin your own armories, your own vans
All these cool watches can match your gold plated cask vaults
happen at parties, too
