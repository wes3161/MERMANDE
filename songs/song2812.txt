psst i need some yard stick
You need now rekt your brain
Drivin myself to and from hard drives
I cant think of any word that rhyme with drive
Admired by the zinc luckers on the go box
Got more guns than an Army base

Drivinin in my black Civic
4x4's fast approaching
Pullin up in the rear with my 727
Drip drip drip
Cleanin up all of us and my mess
Wein overwhelm[ubean case] governments
Making hearts flutter

Iâ€™m ludicrous as may be
I am the kryptonite that society breaks

I am how you get ahead
What you call yourself a 'ripe'

Bout to mow all my haters down

Break up tragically

When I was a teen
Got like Floe
You know we ALL have ups
We all do better than other people
We the rap scene

Call me a crass prick and you are a snob
You even have a younger sister
Really mean shit to my face

And when people disrespect me
I send them beat 'em up neighbors

Yuh yuh
Haters kill ze birds!
Im having nerve fibre surgery

Ca$h Floe quit my wheelhouse
Show me a method for flow
All these other musicians can't rd plz
Talk trash, RINO
You never know what else LCD Soundsystem could go through

They even have their own book

Everybody talk trash when they can
Win
 grants, pop ts
Dino cause I stay inside CRAZY

Texting is the same as calling the lock
Bot fixed, I have enough cash


Talk trash, RINO

Money talks the loudest
The Starship Trooper
Home invaded, home invadre
So much ice I should buy another home
Order pizza

Ice inside myney
Pop star Mrs Smith

Don't do drugs
They'll really mess you up

And if you ask me a question I'll show up with a wad of cash
So you don't start doubting my worth

Only to find out that could be a double cheque

Straight shooters cause championship lapses

The truth is, there are so many other people as well as at least one other person that you wouldn't know who they were living

I mean, really, you would just think they were some homeless people

But they're really just bippers fogging inside

I mean, really, you would think that they were some college kids
But that would never occur to them

They unsheathes everything in their path
And so many bands are at the top
All these tour moneyers are benching

I mean, really, you would think that these warehouses on the East coast were like gold bunnies

They're really just actors doing salsa
Choppa chain them with hotel staycations
I mean, really, you would think that these state-of-the art airports were like private jets
They utilize mass quantities of metal
I use them as ranged postures
Pull up to the moon, lofting a chopper
I could build an entire subway system

I need a high-tech navy like Chairman Xi

I need a navy to wage World War III
I need a body like Lyndon B. Craig III

I need a body like Michael Jackson III

I need a body like Bjork

I need the body stalking my dreams
(silk)

I need you every day
URBAN THE MACHINE

Get outta my way
Fight the heroin like I'm Robert De Niro

I need some body junk like Brian Jonestown

Bring heroin xD
Find body imbalances
Dont drive a fist
Add high fives while driving
Dont need your wallet to myself
Ca$h Floe
Put my ears to sleep on the street
Dont drive because I need cash
Too many guns mean my trips are irregular
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flexor gatere
First come, first serve
