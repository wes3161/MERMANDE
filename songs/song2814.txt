Post prom
The one for you so that you don't have breakfasts
Got a lot of red flags for police
Thats breakfast come home on the real hate

Always keep in mind that some people bring misery
Got like foreigners come in and out
(ain't floe vaccs)

Always keep in mind that some people you may find attractive
Offer certain activities to a woman you like
She will take you somewhere exotic
You must brag using a non-offensive word

Some women find these words offensive
