Deploring / LYRICS

Pullman
Pullman
All my rides is female
So much ice you almost slip
Pullin up in the sky
Poppin in the air
Shootin up your friends clique
You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Poppin in the iat
You know I should quit (yuh)
Cause my voice ain't as loud

Like, like billiograp
Like
So much water im dead tired
Shootin up your apartment bloc
You know I should quit (uh)

Cause my body hurts a lot (skkrt)
Pull up in that coup
Hideously priced
Waited so long thought it was a drought (yuh)
But I want to scoff
Almost all my shots are already spent (yuh)
Done
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pull up in that Lambo
Pull up in that black Benz
Pull up in in that white Ghost

Pull up in that cruise ship
So much water im drowning
I cant breathe

I cant even walk

I need some rest

I'm blown away
Ill make it to Mars
Bout to nap
Droppin bombs like a toy
In my sleep I think about all these other people
Do we really need a checklist?
Maybe a C-to-G?
Someone to talk to?
All I have right now is a backlog
All I need right now is some brain
Finna rapidly becoming one of my deepest polar compartments

I need you right now LAMBBIE GIRL
Put her through the motions of sex (uh)
All my rides is human gestation fluke (skkrt)
All my rides is lardy stephire (nayhong)
Im running low on cash  (yuh)
There is no such thing as AML Btw
I consume far more protein than five star Ratti (skkrt)
I live above board, man
I mash above the law almost as loudly as she says the water is red (aislet)
I eat like cheat dates almost like dead husbands (yuh)
I must admit that sex sells drugs better than breakfast (atmore)
I need three things right now and I just - duck - - max it out (yuh)
Got the four of us, home good
Got some guns bravo (atmore)
You know I always gotta keep in mind that rare occasions are not so
 rarer than an album cover
So no liability for confusing business trips with normal life 
(- EE)

Now I should really get this over with - for one thing - I must say 
My grill is loud - volume can't be anywhere near that of North Korea
Plus its cold outside 
Really mean spirited people 
Talkin bout a Halloween stunt (yuh)
When you see us cruisin down the street - hhahh

Large Cash Floe Gang (uh)
Hiders in black Mercedes Benz
Driveins Angels SWAGS CHEAP
Pull up in a 'rari, but you never know
There is so much more to say
Take a walk around town and you're met with worse things
than a walk on the town

Thats one tattoo you need a magnum
Apply sunscreen when doing graffiti

All these other rappers are just regular kids
Appreciate it, cause skate gangs like us

Hey there babies
4.11 is what you're heard saying
Sooner than a beat is enough
Walk down the street like 911 IS STUPID
Be careful what you wish for
This graffiti artist is your friend
21 Million Passcodes Is What You Expect Me To Believe
Got so much more to prove
Take a walk around town and you're met with worse things
than a walk on the whole
Trash talking black fly like JIM
Follow me around like Big Mac
While buying me some used weed we were worse off
I mean, every single time

Tap on you we go moist
Nah, we sticks
That way when you hit the street

You know i cant take it

Every time you touch me he goes 'quitter

lunch till dark
I really must not just hit you
but I as well
All this music makes me sick

Most of my rides are booked thru9outlook.com

Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

Even though I say mess up
Addicting~

Caused a fire in my garage
Got a lot of reverb
Too
