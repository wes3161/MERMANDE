Prices in the nine toughest in the North!

They ri Weldin in the ground rent like, "Three in the tree! Yuh!"

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil M3 to know that its a trailer park rip
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They askin where im from and what im talking bout
I just bought a yacht so im the captain now
I got so much money I could buy the Dow
Got the stendo clip and I aint never play around

Better watch what you say fore I snap
Roll up on yo crib and we go brat-a-tat-tat
Thats one for your head two for knees three for your back
Always keep in mind that snitches always come in last 

Blindin people with my rims when I roll down the street
Resturant bill be longer than a CVS receipt
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

Everyday im out here grindin stackin up that paper
You a minor league but I be ballin like the majors
All these watches never time for any haters
Always rise above it cause I take the elevator

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that April Fools game
Don't do drugs
Shootin up rear
Keep it onehunnid

Pullin up in that ads homogeny
All this pop
All this pop
All this pop
All this pop
All this pop
Pullin up in that elevator time rollin by
All these watches never time for any haters

Always rise above it cause I take the elevator

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Apr Fools game
Don't do drugs
Shootin up rear
Keep it onehunnid

Pullin up in that April Fools game
Don't do drugs

Pullin up in that April Fools game
Don't do drugs

They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Maskin down im one of the fiercest

Maskin down im a co-worker
Everything im saying illegal
 Tells da gang i could do with a bouffant
To myself
 I should consider leaving

Just so we can scout out more nests

Let it be known
That comment amaze nourish
Pop pop pop
10 found carefully
Trash lot have mayo
Don't understand
Ask 'bout to mess with me

Large group spray makin it
All these dives
I rin your make up
I eat your brain

You a minor league but I'm rock solid
My best jams stack
My platinum found your on the go
Take a bust
Run the bank and withhold help
From start to start
Plot to close in on Chile
So we all know how it is
We large groups make it so
You guys amn't really different

Don't do drugs
Don't do drugs
Don't do drugs
Don't do drugs

Donot mess along at synchronization
