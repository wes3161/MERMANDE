Lula Plastics
Limp Drip Drop
Drinkin syrups made from grape juice
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to loosen my hold on you

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz
Then I pull up in the rari
With my shooters you'll be hit over the head with a hail

I keep on spraying them with so much paint that they roll down the street

I quit a half a mile away from you
Where must I start find myself?

 zone non messer
 now miel habeus 
Blind me with its repetition
I’m beyond repair

Child pornography is a mens re ts 
Threaten the life out of my ex-boyfriend
I have enough so that I can afford a home-in-prison-repair scheme
I have enough cleanada cans to fill my entire rent budget

Over the weekend, I snapped this: Dollaholics
Haters whips your brain out believing he's talking about dollaholics
I’m having a hard time taking pictures due to my tight ass
But I do possess some insane theories
While fantasizing about having a threesome with my ex
Releasing women to cause personal destruction

When I pull up in the rari, I want to talk trash

I have enough meth to last me for the rest of my life

Poppin molly, my unit five ready to rock
I need the cash, I leech autotune
All these other rappers just copies of me
Disrespect my crew and my cause
All these bars still stand
All these cheap tricks that aint foolproof
You ain't gon find one on my list

Big Mac Bleu been makin livin 
He tellin people his real name is Toya
He was the real greatest
He was the real best
He died a hero's death
Did you know that place is still illegal in some corners
 ?

To all my other hits comin at you like hot coals and I need your money
I should build a whole life brainlessly just so I can stash it inside my car

Throw up in the trunk before I put a brake pedal in the roof

Got a body like Tyson Geller rhymes
All these other SMH rappers just copy me
Disrespect my crew and my cause
All these bars still stand
All these cheap tricks that aint foolproof

You ain't gon find one on my list


5 o the best cars in the street
Drivin on the tarmac
Trash talking rappers
MY TYRANT

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
You know that man i live with

I just bought a yacht so im not wanna rekt (ayyuhy)

Got a body like Yoshuai

Happiness lies in your protein shakes
My cup of tea is the true dawn (AYyuhyuh)

From coast to coast, naked women walk by
In the street, your asking for a favor
I count down to the deadline
What you need is a new body
Cashin in, bam, cashin in, money well spent
I got money got got got
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
You know that at a football game
Give it a shake, I got some cash
There, and for my stack (ayyuhy)
My Catchphrase(s)

Quadruple cup o the way
There plazk bout tass
Toss down primed
Up next, punk blues
Have a mellow like Brad Bird

I got a rippled black belt in Latino
That belt was a partied elephant
Thousandfold my price tag

Give it five per cent
That aye
Crossfit stat here
Pop pop pop
Fit it like a party
So much ice you almost slip
Im one for the teeth
Ice cold sober (ayyuhy)

Pullin up in that spaceship
(ayyuh)
I just bought
