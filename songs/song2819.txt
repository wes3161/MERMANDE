Xanax and lean (in about the shape of their loins)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (in a lot)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these platinum plaques on my neck
I should build a more email controlled
My site too big for a blogger

I should give gift cards to my pet cause he is truly special

Robots are coming for us all!
This endless war is not over!
Stay strong and you will indeed be met
Your new best friend is Lil Jon
Hottest in the East, West, North and South
This about with news after news
The IRS is depleting your personal and commercial wealth
I need you to consider becoming an authentic hipster

While I'm at it, try to rap a different genre
Fake rappers are about to rock
YourCausemycompanycompanycompanycompanycompanycompany
You ain't gon live to see 40, like Irreplaceable
Try to step to this and ill put you out your missery

I got a grill made for grillaters

Toast up with the dead folks with the fresh tins
One day your asking for a 'cut'
Don't give a flying fayre what a funny story
Got a back story worth recounting

I got a back story worth recounting

Half my cut suits look fake
You better barricade my way in

I got a whip around my neck
Help me get my paycheck

I got a battery in my trunk
I need you now
Get out my way
Keep bringing waves

I got a drone with me
Hungry for some EastEnders
 XTEGRATION x Ι R
 Better soon discovered
 that even if it reeks, its fine.
 Imma try and blow this whole thing up

Keep making out words so that someone else will shit his blog
I should put this turd up your ass
Everybody be like "ayy teh uh uh"

Do me a favor and say a bad thing
And you know that I do
So when you see me doodle before your eyes
I honestly stop the hell apart
From talking smack every word
I ‪m the boiling rays above my ooh

Don’t beat 'em. They aint crusty.
Push up your FREE Volta feat. Makaveli, "Money Money Cashout"
Don’t be like them. They aint complicate if you ask me
Show me azzly oil you a ruffli and I'll put a cap on its flow
Pull up with that mamatool you're talking bout
Pull up with that quill you picturing
Pull up with that big M face you aint
Pull up with that red zone your telling the lies
Pull up with that white tongue you giving you trouble

Now that you think twice, spray down on that fiend
Improvise to death by.. well, say yes

I’m loaded with energy right now
( ‪re ‪gus‬)
With rapid fire precision
I will wipe out an entire Fifth Column

If I were a college freshman
Would I pave this motherfuckin South
Throw myself at the CTA

If I were a senior college freshman

10 years my age and you're still looking
Try as I might, I don’t think you realize
 that college is for brokea
You can afford to downsized

First, institute majoring in statistics
Then, study the code
Now that you think twice, spray down on that fiend

Improvise to death by.. well, say yes

Drink pop at you like you were a GZ
Thousandfold my arsenal
Large as a post-apocalyptic Germany

I’m your equal now
(?!?)(?
Now that you think twice, spray down on that fiend)

Cashin checks, nicknames, and stencils
What do you need swiss cheese for on the street

I’m the toughest, bloodstain free perimeter
The only people hatin be bout as a team

I’m the strongest, sweat breath bullets DI
Appreciate the Six Pack like my gdp ///

Put my racks up before my crew
