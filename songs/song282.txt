Haters love album skk omnipotence
I pop all genres and archetypes
Mostly dramaturgy
Drama penny-pinching
Funny thing is that even though I have dissed a million rappers
I never take them out on a thrift shop shootdown

Keep pointing the finger at me and I'll snap
You don't need to be a hipster to appreciate that sneaker store bust
I got so much money I should be CEO
So I pop all genres and archetypes
Mostly dramaturgy

Drama tube beggar person infomates
I start with rapping about rap acts and labels
Next I start making shoes that look like iPods
I need to start mixing my real thing
This will convince the dissolute that I am legit
I need to start selling my wares and making money

I should be dead already

Fake rappers are a grim reaper doth sthout

Drip drip drip drip
Drop money on the challenge yu

Invest in the future and you will rise

Your voice not only loud but powerful
You will lift the world

And viceversa

1) start mixing your sound 
You can start making sound results
all you have to do is look like a trash canteen

2) Let the trash start ya
Add some purple on top
Everything you say counts
All that blinking in your phone will prove a lie
You better hope not my unusual dye
Everything you say is real
Do you like pineapple splinters?
Start mixing right now

The real rappers are beyond cruel
 Go pro and you'll see
