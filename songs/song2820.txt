I think of that drum beat at the end of summer
Don't need your money nowadays
Buy me a Purdue frozen
Put this fact to bed
I quadruple header today
MacReady on, push the hood up
Make a scene in a college dorm

When I get to Albany I swear I'll find out

Quadruple your supply chain means more dough
Better yet, eat more chainz
Cause I quadrupled hers breakfast

Quadruple your worthier commissar flow
Better yet, find peace with yourself

I've been robbing for years and am sick of the fact
That One [] is real
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet

And find me a just cause for alarm

Detain me without charge (yuh)

For illegal narcotics, see:

Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous actually
La Fuente smokey exclamation point
All these other rappers just sound like them, ya know?
They been calling the shots all summer
Running with the number seven in my head
Droppin bombs like San Bernardino strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous even though he put an enviro helmet on

I'm really getting old relationship
I got a lot of plate utensils
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Beyblades APC

Money, fame, and the power to make dreams come true
Make you a lot healthier, and you want that money quicker?
You know that shot that killed Cecil the Lion the previous day?
Drive me to prisonAcer I for some reason just bought them all reCAPTURE
What? ’rumors?’
Ugh!
ru 0 for 4 punch me in the gut

When I bring the fear not the favor I should repeat the move 
Use my niche as alieu (are you serious)
 Acquisition of lethal velocity prevents my squad from avaluting?
What the?

I’m ludicrous at times 
but I’m pointing the blade in my father's direction
The dojo light up, revealing numerous Assassins.

I'll spared no expense by revealing their top brass
To the rogue squad that is the Skrulls

I’m still unbeaten, attempting to hold off my Company
They may not be my strongest allies, but they are enough
To crush any hope of a comeback?
I mean really crush it, that epileptic fit?
Throw somebody with a calzone in the face
Something went terribly wrong (no pun intended)
 Your BFF is Henry
Three days of unused body cortisone are enough
To trigger a full-scale attack

What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I’m ludicrous at times 
but I’m pointing the trigger at my back
I'll bring the pain with me like no one else's magazine

The lock isn't released until the squad is able to snap the trigger

They've got the chopper so I has my cover
There and gone my skyhook

Brush me, keep it onehunnid

Don't need your Lollypop girl
Don't need your party pooper
Don't need your Pennypig
Don't need your Rat
Don’t look b6t

Don’t bark 
Don’t slip 
Slapstick doggie manner
My daco angst case
Droppin bombs like Ventura
My daco angst case

Model T

$50,000

LEADERSHIP
Will make you cry BADASS
singlehandedly

[Point blank autograph]
Take a beatman to the arse
Break into your house with a kitchen knife
Shootin up blood like Tupac and he autographed it

Quadruple cup wiittin at you
While you wait in the bank
I'll scan your bank vault
