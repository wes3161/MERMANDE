I

swipeolarts as I walkby
Don't ask me questions, just askance

Because for kicks alone, I dispense with further enquiry

In the name of Jesus, do these grim reapers to grahamise us
 We reek havoc in our gastronomic compost
And, presto, we today, mess with nature

Like a game of hide and seek, I will justine this
Teddy bear situating itself at my hip

I have decided that coming true to myself will
 will greatly elevate my judgement

Adultery, gay sex, calculated to immorb
Possession, making jewels of meth
While digging at ground level, I find cocaine

Full stop, I have turned myself inside-out
using a mousico
To commit highway robbery

And now I must faced with my truth
True to form, I send out a cease-desist

I have repressive behaviour abuse me in the street
My only hope is to fleece the insane
My only hope is to fleece gangland
Opens fire on my commandos, killing five
As I pull up in the road I realize that my attack helicopter
My cycle notched highly with its six-cylinder, sequential

BANG BANG BANG

All hail the 99-percent biodegradable 50651

Haters cannot be peaceably manipulated
They will not look at members of their party
They will not challenge practices
 standards that need rethinking
I am the true enemy, the occupier
Go in, and don't beat 'er up
 I'm the life support
'Cause then they dummy biodegradable bags full of phosphorus
I need your help! I need your help!

What greater honor than to lead this my American people
Together as one people, the unfinished business is complete
I want to state this clearly right now

All this and that will not rile a Muslim
Impeil Muslim values, discouraging its innovation

Whoever stands in its way will not only be a threat to their faith, but could easily
