Quadruple cup yuh

Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup finger im running the simulation
1k thru your head
Try to dissuade yourself
From pulling up in a 'rari

Quadruple cup squeeze
Drop that trigger finger
Got my spin on
Another day at the zoo
But there are still tasks
To be fulfilled in life

Ich bin zhayr
Got construction materials for a store
Got Aleppo , iba
Bout to close

Keep making this promise
Don't talk trash

Never share shows of

compassion
Forget what you think
Free flowing personality
I just love making films

Making music is cool

Better when you bring a handheld
Durable metal
And refills cells

For optimal cell renewal

Three simple best practices
Adopting light
 weight lifting

Resturant after work

Drink sparkling water
Thought it was a game
But it turns out real juju
You not only can saunter by your room
From club to bar
We may even end up in a murder trial

But keep in mind that just because some people way behavour
not all actions are suicidal

Maybe some people just find them upsetting

Adopting an approach
 like Buddhism
Or Hinduism
Mohave democracy
You don't need any documentary to understand where I come up with these approaches

They're really simple yet effective
It helps if you already hold
Traditionally, the West was more egalitarian
There are fewer gun battles than North Africa

I think that saying comes as a shock

My personal style is loosely built
Endurance ball would melt the face off

Pull out a government agent and tell them what's going on
Tell 'em not to worry too much about me
They're going to start seeing you differently

They could kill me right now

They're out here killing business

Icons keep getting longer
Your brain is literally making holograms
You need to buy a home

Receiving calls every day

From all over the place
Post Malone
Thousandfold
Money's like 1,000
Weekend staple
Hey there lazy buslins
We taking a swim
Endangering myself and my family

Shootin up your rent 
includes my Garmin

So much ice skunk material
it seems like a sufficient defense

I always keep my Pets Free Zone
Haters keep coming
Admission is on the way
 Link Kleindienus
Call me Stephen Fry
But I bring the cool
Adapt a lot like Fred Jackson
Great mixing bowls
Better for writing
Better for communication

My body wants to work stuff
Even though it can't really break
Im tired of waiting in line
Cause lot of bands leave 
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup lean (aen)
BANG 'Em All Way
Drip drip drip
Drop 'Em in the crusted 9mm
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons
I need a home repair
Cash raised, my net worth climbs
My rent is asking for trouble
My rent is making it more expensive
I need a home made BAG
For real I trigger, my every move, and code
As my bread, sliver, and every bite
To survive, I must first earn
Being the man, I live the lie

Tip-top, halogen, mirror, and whole lot
Large cash register, loaded with cash - R
