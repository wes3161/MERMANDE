Verace

real
Fake
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip (taco)
All my rides is foreign whips (HUMAN INSTITUTION)
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don (gut) reardon my words, for a moment I thought I was joking
I don't need any Eastern European family
Soapbox full of bands (more like emcee)
Waiting in the wings is my rap game (get it)?
Hungry for some revenge on Pesky (ayy)
He launched my raid (yuh)
Droppin bombs like (ayy) strip
Got them beyblades let it (ayy) ( image )
That whole raid (ayy) was my only threat

I needed a target on my team (yuh)
So I went for it, shooting Metallica with my shotgun (ayy)

I think I just fired a home invul (skkrt)

Large cashiers and drunks (yuh)
Droppin body bags like (yuh) on action (yuh)
I need your help, Obi-Wan (skkrt)
Hella synthetic meth (skkrt)
My body needs your help, Big Mac
A-hello!
Maaargh!

My rent cut
Through the bank
Got my rent raised inexpensive

Everything went extremely quiet

Looking in the window

Choppa, chicken, lean
Picnics, news, movies

To some I have hand painted
Dem bags out in the street

What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

Everyday
Throw a murder scene
Drive an armored car
My chain would break
And with it, my library

And my super stores

I'd probably die a slow, far less frequent

Need a name?
Take a breather
Start a fire
Clean up after myself

Start with your lean
Everything you eat should be lean
Downtown, I just bought 20

Everything you eat should start be lean

I pop you with the stendo clip
Ring next to you some
When you think I live here, I stay here

I pop you with my pop face
Male restraint devices
I removed your spleen
Remove your clavicle
Gluttony drugs make you lean
Will you always be my pop

Downtown, I just bought 20

Everything you eat should be lean
Large cashiers and drunks (mask on)
Step inside my Jackson
Pick up all of your buy-dasrs
Just like a pro
Shoot you with a 17 mm
When I live in Costa Rica
AM World increase key

I need a body director
