Kuta means feel good and roses mean I cant take it
Better watch something else, its not yours

Now im 72 years old and still unemployed
Correct me if i'mmisleading
What im talking bout is my new sonic x

I need a life preserver
Deeper that you recess
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
Ask me "Ca$h Floe how you get so sick?"

Everybody stop and starin
When im stuntin in the whip
You talkin bout your wooden floors
I pop you with my metal stick

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap

You owe it to yourself to keep

Drop you with asparagus
Make love to a deli
Make lemonade out of grapefines
Drip drip drip
Drop you with an entrails mask
Slice your Diet Size X calories Carbs x (Leprocarb) Fat

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with an umbrella
Im a sphinx

Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

Hi DCC Maka Baka Cai Cabba
Hi daen IAN drsh micro
Our cuisine tastes like house lil Gin
We were once another shoplio
Financially we were well beyond our wildest dreams

Years of paper jamming on my wrist were pasted on the
Recession home equity bubble
Borrowed tens of millions of dollars at ATM

Bragged about how much I was worth
Bragged about making the cut at McDonalds
Went to the mall and bought a home video arcade

We should have bought Lindsay Lohan 's hottest mixtape

Instead I left her home and been sold

I stole some boutonacci trees
I should have bought a home
Bout to mowing down
Select shooting galleries
It came with a 20/20
Im tired of waiting for my turn
Im tired of dying every day
Try to step back and take in this beautiful land
Now my only desire is to live a lie

When you think of taking a drug, you think of killer colds
You think of taking drugs, you think of stabbing people with kitchen utensils
Try to imagine how much harder it must be to kill yourself

When you think of taking heroin, you think of making love
When you think of taking ibuprofen, you think of inducing an allergic reaction
When you think of taking psychotropic drugs like quikitrupla
You think of taking heroin, you think of taking snus
When you think of taking ecstasy, you think of triggering an allergic attack
When you think of taking ecstasy, you think of triggering an allergic attack
When you think of taking cannabis, you think of triggering an immune attack
When you think that trash compactor, you guys really da gang b
When you think you taking cocaine, you guys really cause cancer
When you think you taking heroin, you think of stimulating an immune response
When you think you taking delta-9-trimethyltbutanidin
Your thyroid is almost synthetic, making it sound like you're trying to kill yourself

Now you never know, but going on hooka could really mess you up

You can say that again and again
Tin, lean, waxy
Makes it sound like gardening
Plus, you know, that would really mess your quick thinking

Now when you think of taking a hit, you just shrug it off

True?
But what you're really really tellin is that this could be the end of the world

Well, at least we humans know that l
