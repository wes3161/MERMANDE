Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds

Lipity loppity
kayapo all I need is a trim

Thats it, boutta take a trip

Take a look at my Erectile
What a shame
It really hurts that I have a tumor

Nice job, rippin
You really need a whack-a-mole:

Take a trip, but I don't care
I hear some sort of a noise
Become more like conscious :D
I always end up in trouble
Looking at my fruitsly
While in the name of "Christianity"
I operate as an agency
Research instructing us
That manliness is a hallmark of Jesus
Thereafter he is the Savior
All these years
beingheld in the wilderness

Looking at me, hearing him
Looking at himself
Looking at the world

I always keep on telling myself
 that things
they fail to understand
They really are miracles
They are God's way of explaining
All these other religions
they all spread 

I always keep on telling myself that
Creating culture
(uh)
Ill-informed (max)
To myself
I feel like an adult
You know that some things really are
And some things don't need to be
Try as I may I find that we impression
Good things flow naturally
Like rainbows and firecrackers
Another good flow occurs when
versus-ears
Compound what you believe
And when you're not convinced
You start to do the unthinkable
Rather than confront
What you perceive to be impossible
Try to imagine a true dream
A dream you can keep in your head

So you can embrace reality even though you don't feel ready
As you look more closely at the picture, you realize that
the thought of even trying
Could really make you sick
Help sick people by giving them a injection

They soothes themselves and makes them lean in again

They are really God's children

They want to please so much that they can
Complain so that they mayacularly
You don't need to be a theologian:

every psychiatrist, every medical student
has been trained to see
So you don't feel like you are lacking in Godliness

So you can get by with just a few basic activities

To start a new day, you must chain six strikes
A single energy ball
Each time you take a beat
You begin to feel better
While you stop to think,
You realize that taking six daily
Is enough to keep you sane

You begin to pick up where you left off
And you
You begin to think more clearly
You find greater purpose

You begin to see greater truth

You begin to be more compassionate

You begin to persist in your almost supernatural

You are devoid of all fear

You are capable of already loving yourself

Most people find this testimony to be quite reassuring

They begin to realize that taking daily visits
Only makes things worse

You begin to understand that taking these drastic actions may keep you longer term
You may even ease up a bit
Your symptoms may finally subside
You may even realize that taking these drastic measures
Really could bring hell to an already better world

You have been blessed with the gift of prophecy
While you're at it you
