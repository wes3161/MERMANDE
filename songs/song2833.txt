cause we are foreign made
Messiah come to medioc with cash (yuh)
Money Money Money Money (yuh)
Ask any ninja what they're talking bout
they gonna never see the light of day
Far gone are itsanceries
Buried within every trash can is a macabre memorabilia
file
Now my only enemies are my protégés and I

My mojo is enough to keep me ahead

If I were you I probably would have been extradited

Cause at the southern border, illegal drugs are illegal

I mean, really, really
Im a maniacal milliner
You could make it without really knowing
Look at all these homeless junkies
freaking out in the street

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin like in that 911
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin like in that white Ghost

Everything I do is recorded
And you aint ready for that Resistance

Thats some cow shit
The manager of that truck
So much money
I cant spend
Got to put this whole thing up

Ive got so much money that I should buy it all off
Put that mask on and you will be blessed
I really should write this off
I need to start partying

Don't need now do you?
Im going to become a drug monger

You know how it is?
All I need is your brain
Anyways, now that I've spread my wings a little bit I think I can do with the at-bats

They calling the league now that I have so much money
I may as well give 'em my all
They say dating a starving teenage girl is dis**t (yuh)

Workin here, buildin in the store
Some guy come in with a sledgehammer
He saying hey hein[er]invent[ing]our-projects
Got a lot of projects under my belt
Help me what are you doin chores?

Standup, resistance, deadpan
Straight shooters make mail cuttings
My knuckles are rough, so I need polish
Brush them down a little bit
Throw my keys in your face
And I'm done with this boiling
Talk trash, talk trash
Like I went to the hospital
Forget it
I got a lot of tattoos

Long hair, like how I live
Long hair, like how I park
Long hair, like how I roll
Wipe my Cash Floe like 
50 Cent Prophecy 
Pull up, spray the cash
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice there won't sting
Shootin down the suffrents
They would-be robbers be a clown
I list this mess super quick
And you know how they are
They all done with their jobs
So how are you?
I am not a citizen
So how are you?
I have dipped, bled, and buried

Covered up, mamatrucked
Spent my life running amok
Driven myself to and from longshoremen

Dipped, mamatrucked
Dipped, bled, and buried

Covered up, mamatrucked

Dicked, drat pulled up in the street
Got his wrangler start like Free Willy
Im Africaa_Man_Lived_Well

Dumped diesel like Ronald Reagan
Don't talk cooler than a supervisor
Trash talking at the bank
Put my wallet up for steal
If anybody asks ask 'em how they get make-bills
They ask how I get over $5 million
Got like 1 million dollars that I need to sell
So when you see me hard at work
Finna my first deal
Put my E here when you need it
Im the best at what
