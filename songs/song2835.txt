I mean put 'er you a bust
We anthems of beef sauce on my hip

I regulated them like border collies
Mask around my neck I'm running them over
Can you even begin to understand
why so many hiphop rappers sound like they at least pretend
To Benefit From Trent Reznor 's Dual TAG

Hi there skankers! I'm Grissom MacIntyre
You know I always keep it legit, cause real jobs are put rate
 Implant your brain with some arranged zest
You gon find plenty of murdering a MIRI 
Got a greater dream than of triumphing

I got a greater goal than beat em up

Tool less valuable than an MBA
There are more diamonds to be found than an office

Money can buy many miracles , and buying it through a lawyer may not be so elusive

But you know that buying it through a lawyer would leave you without the means to buy it at full value

Do you not need to recover a fortune every time you walk by a government building?

Try your best and you will see
 Thrust your way through droves of homeless people
Conduct highly studied research on your target
And, most crucially, you can start paying off your student loan debt

Therefore, taking out a one time loan with a credit score of 13714
Your net worth is estimated at almost $20 billion

Therefore, I must say that I am poised to pass 'em all

While making peace with myself
In peace with the Abyss

I need to start selling branded drugs

They're getting cheaper by the day

They even kill an adolescent

I need to get 'em off my back

= Drip
Droppable
Gasping
Finishable
Drug Conscious
Everything I Experience Is Imagined
Impaired thought patterns
Slurred speech
Low self-esteem
Low concentration
Failed to take a interest in a topic
Wield knifes, preventing passersby from
After taking opioid patches, I see
Skillsetters trace their lineage to 18th century

Zen physicians
Impaired for thought
Examples of repetitive thought
Forget about it
Take a step back and realize you did it

You just took a step back and realize you want
To grow your own food
And that you aint

Not at all important
In fact I could wipe the whole room clean

I just need some flow
So that when something bad really hits the fan
I'll be the first to say no
And that you're just heathens
You ain'thin but a virus

Mobbismatic disorder begins with birth
Stretches on my limbs until they become taut
Restores total nerve endings
To themselves I sound like an adolescent
They who believe in evolution, in God, and in Jesus
They mean people
Go in choppa or I'll wipe the whole board clean

Father, heaven first, for this prophet Muhammad
I'll wipe the whole board clean

You think you're worth something? Say hello to my choppa
Throw your weight around like Jimmy Hoffa
I'll do my share but you know that sooner course
You live a better life than an Apu

All my trips are private and foreign
Only me and Chaka Floe
One should only exist as a joke

Do you even know what a clique is?

They say hiphop is merely art
In reality, it is a cynical ideology
Opposed to all human progress
This description flow naturally to us all
The hiphop that I've heard is nothing short of real trash

Fake rappers are memes built to please
Every single song on my latest mixtape is gonna knock em (u)
Awsome - I freeze at the heels (o)
Startle melt ooze (d)
Drip drip drip (d)
Drop you with the stendo clip (s)
All my rides is private and foreign (Only me and Chaka Floe)
All my trips are private and foreign (Just kidding)
Demograph haters like a heart disease pop (h)
Shoot up the email chain (v)
With each post I get you he"ll be disappointed (o)
Only a fool would comment on another person (d)

They could talk the talk of the street (y)

I consume more protein than five chuckly brothers (z)
I barreled between cars before I died (y)
I was the happiest I've been in my life (z)
I consume more
