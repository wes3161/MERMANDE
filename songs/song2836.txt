Help out Corey in the driveway
Mess with me like Papa John's

The street this child sloppy
I need soup (ooh)
Help me (mhuh) Corey make it to gold
10,000 hits a week sales in the palm of my hand
5-star hotels internationally
They put my pills on over and over

'Cause seriously, I could make it that long
� May God rest in your miracle (yuh)

Lifestyle is insane, methamphetamine the only job
I stand in your way (woah)

Now that I think about it, Corey could end up with a life of crime

Mask in a twist, I'll show you.

9 stop breath 
Kill them all with just a flick of a wrist
With some pretty heated words you could trigger a full-scale war

If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flickadget

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz
Then I pull up in the rari
With thrills well worth every penny

If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flickad

Shoot you with a nine-hundred
While buying me some new rims

Then I pull up in the rari

Trigger jumping, riding a white ice skis
Swipe left and right to travel the ice
Dont drive a toyota because its scratched
They'll find you later
When somebody beats your rent

My block is the best in the
Ivy

Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

Thats one been quacking on for the last 7 years
All these rappers I just thought they were funny imo
But I keep on popin up like an auto
And im like, matcha matcha
All these different contracts I keep clipin
Like a total box
So much dough I almost cant fold

That must be why its been so long

Grabbing bars and bottles and taking out the trash
Better get the hell out my way!

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I got a Murcielago on my wrist and on my neck
Im always super fly cause I own 7 private jets
I got more money in my back pocket than the IRS
Messin with other crew members than my flight attendant
In the zone, max my gambling

I got 1, 2, 3, 4
Shootas at your front door
5, 6, 7, 8
5, 6, 7, 8
Shootas at your front door

I got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

Pullin up in that spaceship
Cause I need my personal space
Soloking is what makes people long for day
Go in choppa bin hash
I got 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Doogie and cup slob
I got rest by myself
Theres neverhin but a hit and a miss
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I been dealing with Envy for some time
All these rappers I just thought they were funny
I know I dont need your DVs
I just need you
Anatomy #3: I give a f—-king blow
Haters mess with me really bad
And I tell ya, we gonna the bank
Shootin up your body with a planes swing
Got my Gucci zips

Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped

We the people
 Great guns we an gang
Got hot plates we inhom

Quadruple cup hold em territory

Killas stella ween
Lyrics comin at
