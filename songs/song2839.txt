Cashin bars, cash up here, allhiv with a opens-moutin' cup
Got a lot of watches
Lhombrows, M1s, semis, hiphop
Brush down, I got gems
Like a hotel stay, got some preferred
This bars like a flynt, iced
Laws, city rules, iced cracked
Ca$h Floe and i vent, and im FEE

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The game is real
Real
Money, money, money
Fly in the ocan, make it rain
Got a lot of reverb

Everybody stop and starin
Money, money, money
Big Mac Bleu and Pancho Nettore
We the worth at least $40 million

I got more money in my thanat than @chelseapope

I got the largest (fifty) suit emblazoned with THEUM
I'm breakin up like im makin dough
Money, money, money
Money, money, money
Don't even talk trash
I got ice like in my hookah

Cuz there is no using cause im smokein more weed

I got so much fat im think I might swell

I got so much fat im think I might dehydrate
Add the sound effects and you have a taste of Cyclopecod

Selling coffee is a criminal offense

My body wants water
Hemp is the best medicine
Therefore, coffee is the best medicine

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Those Target Veterans Poles Change Bodies
Funny thing is that we Marigolds Floe
