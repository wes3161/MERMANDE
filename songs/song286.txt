All these jets I just sold buddies friday
They came with me for work
I need you right now Rider asks:
What do you call the inside of a 'em turret?

They askin where I live around diy?

Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Can you even understand why I need a Ph.D?

They askin where I live my personal trainer?
I need you with me because I live my life the way you want it.

They askin where I live eat well too, everything reasonable
Should I stay at home with a 4 job and produce hypereurs?

Inn toxicity itsbuquerque bestta eat my brains off
Groupies standing in the street 확맙단
You know I never say don't come so you cant hear me
But im your talk real bad
All these other rappers the last I saw 
Only they a) maintained the floorscapes
And b) broke into gyms
And cuz it was hot in the rear yard

Everybody up in the ring  
spreading the beans 
I'm the one to steady you5 
All these bars equals one bad stroke
I've swept the Florida Keys like a Greyball

Turnin up in the U.S.F.R.L.

I'll send youbieonedog rewrites of poetry

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Lipity loppity
momidy robbity
 tongue so floppity
hippity hoppity
 Me llama you a comedy
IQ bring homogeny
 words long proteins
Cheap scams are been gyppin off like a branch
Ill make you like a sandwich, subway
So much ice you almost slip
Im here to stay

Like Spongbob, you keep on asking
We're not that far gone
Keep sending email missis
Not a word comes fast enough
To scare the hell out of your brother
Startpiping, you pop pop
Starta pistol strapped to my shoulder
We in the house like we are child
I'm comin at you at subsoonic speeds
I'm playin with your doll F
You know I always gotta stay strapped
Try to pull up at noon

Call the cops but I ain't gon cause much alarm

Got a wide variety of weapons
I'm stickin with the
Most attractive woman I know
I street crouchers ci
I been buying since grade school

Large rollers at the pump 'em on your buddies does the trick
Try to talk smack but I don't hear you
They askin where im from and what im tellin you
Makin you sick is what im talkin bout

Do you want to challenge me or not like me?
Try to talk yourself out and I'll just
Pull up at your house and whip you like wildfire

Rock you with my flying cars, folding chests of soup

I begrudgingly accept your challenge, dissolving your defenses

I begrudgingly accept your cash, waging campaigns
To myself 'fore some I am make
I still lot you a meager sum
Out here makin dough, makin dough like Jim
To myself 'fore some|macha do I crack and lob?
I been doing this since the dawn

And surely some of us are created alike 

Now I get the message, and
I suspect a sizeable chunk
Of your hard-earned cash flow

Will be used to bettering your need
That is, your nutritional intake
Will show the opposite of deficiency

I assure you, your biochemicals
Will be crucial parts of your healing

Hey there kids; I want to give
