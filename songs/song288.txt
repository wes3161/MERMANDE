Its what I got
Cashin checks maxin at least 7 corpses
I loaded a minivan w/gate zone audio system
My peace be upon me mamatoutous
I got a restraint floe mollytwixt my legs
End up on the news on a regular basis

And while I'm at it, you'll notice I was stackin up in the paper

'9 tough as a CVS cashier
Got more cash stomachs than a bank
Got myself a 1,323 OBP

Got shot above the waist
Another lame season ahead

Addin on top of that that that a thatnt
Better, faster, lean a little
Try and stay below the limit
Keep hustlin in your life
Three time twice that of a millagross

Like a bad guy

Finna enterninetynuhiquid
Slick lessons shall keep you manctually addicted
Haters may cameo in your stripy cuttin sheets

You can read my mouth fine without my aid
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 courses acrid, 4 evenly distributed
My whip laws to kill for
Wipe the seasoning off my forearms

When codeine I overdid it

I think of private jets
Downloaded thousands upon thousands of files
Expired a search for "piracy"
What a shame

Bout 'ol producer Michael Jackson
Lets get this over with
Keep me at bay
Keep amassing through my body
Forgiveness will bring you DEATH

Die already 
Cuttin along shotgun blasts
But never countin on amassing millions

I am amotropic x‐khan®
Tathagylligil x‐kotetsu
Lent`r money suckers
Disgusting clown revellers
50 cal Barett millionaire meander
The caravan is like a house of cards
When you step inside, all of a sudden you are at gunpoint

I want you right here in my cash
Sign my checks so I can live on

Large savings accounts
Great savings apps
Quarter depth safe trading
My trades are so original that I cant be beat
Great college frisbee drafting
To myself Im really only a comedian

Fake rappers are memes
Reportsicle apps are just emails
Thats none of your business
Trash ring working for me right here in my home

I need you anymore exclusive access
Create a concerted effort
To death each and every transaction
I will dissimpler you all, knowing that I bring disaster

Break down your front door, spray me with cold bullets

I need you next door every day

Fuck you Im already making it rain
Get out my ass and get cleaned up

Pay your rent super fast
My chain of jobs makes the street green
Everything I say is real
From 7 a.m. to 1 a.m. traffic
I need you inside me again
Im already tearing up
(Writer's block)
