Braun bombode on yo crib
Sendin like im (barrier) (expired) (in) Army long the home run
Straight shooters snowblades aliased me
Everything iced like iced coffee

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in that Lambo
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They askin where im from and what im talking bout
I just bought a yacht so im the captain now
I got so much money I could buy the Dow
Got the stendo clip and I aint never play around

Better watch what you say fore I snap
Roll up on yo crib and we go brat-a-tat-tat
Thats one for your head two for knees three for your back
Always keep in mind that snitches always come in last 

Blindin people with my rims when I roll down the street
Resturant bill be longer than a CVS receipt
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

Everyday im out here grindin stackin up that brick
You a minor league but I be ballin like the majors
All these watches never time for any haters
Always rise above it cause I take the elevator

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I got a Murcielago on my wrist and on my neck
Im always super fly cause I own 7 private jets
I got more money in my back pocket than the IRS
Messin with my crew results in more than just a threat

I got 1, 2, 3, 4
Shootas at your front door
5, 6, 7, 8
Killas at the back gate

I got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

Pullin up in that spaceship
Cause I need my personal space
Pullin up in that M1
Got more guns than an Army base

Pullin up in that 911
Better get the hell out my way
In the glove I gotta Draco
Better get the hell out my face

Step inside my crib and its like -10 degrees
I got all this ice like I should buy a pair skis
I got all this paper like im cuttin down trees
Ca$h Floe viral
Yeah I spread like a disease

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I been selling cocaine since I was like 6
I live inside a mansion and I built it brick by brick

I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout homeless
