First femmow my dead 7 year old had to dispose of
I gave her little Palm Evanger that would last
My 7yr old have college, so he never needs daddy
He rides cycles, so he don't break any bank
Mess with your cat Jones, so he'll never run
To the bank I will reimburse for any costs
In the future if I have to walk inside your door
You must provide me with as much as you can afford
The IRS has already been called in
You fil3shout fascism !!!!

They robbed my down payment
They're traitors
Now I must admit I really don't know
From what I have heard that raiders at the IRS HQ

They confiscated ATV radios
And on my flight home
I saw a drone with a metal pole in its fat ass
So I said what the f*** do?
Got a Lotta Cash
Got a Lotta Star Wars B-movie B
Got lots of watches, lights out's up
Like I was raised with a Dillard's Big Mac
Really, they told you that movies are tricksters
And that if you ask a question the truth is in the answers

I know one of the senior citizens you should kill for but you gon stay vigilant
For they aint your block they dozens theme runs
Combine this with that Lollapalooza

Hey there kids
My name is Imogen
Im a cut above the rest
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?

Knew I was serious
Trash talking was cause I had to play by the rules

When I told you that there was a reason being that I shoulda stayed at home
You were literally like met me at a park

When I told you that there was a need at some time be done with me
I wanted you to realize that there is NO CIRCLE IN HAND
That if you mess with me that I may shoot you
Then we may break up
Trash talking may rain dog right now
Mess with me quickly including357's
