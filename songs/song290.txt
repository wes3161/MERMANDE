Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your cause(rage)
Its nothin but a well-planned trip
Tellin' be real lies cause we all look like dorks

Quadruple cup ooh
a-translation: I live inside a$AP Mob

You know that imma putle on my wrist
In the glove I buy almost no black
All these shoes hot sale
Im coming this way cause they need to be
They pass out some places

Some people glue their nails in They need punchlines
Slick as heck should be disowned

I feel really blessed
To this day im unaware that many songbirds
Livin up in this room
Like a lambo they come in
Bout to mess with
Trash talking my birds
Out here suckin posh
All these fresh flowers im shootin at my
Droppin bombs like a pro
I cant think of any word that rhyme already
More nervy than gangsta rap
All these ready made mixtures
Singing humanely is a must
All these eye popping lyrics even rhyymes
My personal favorite is "Tell your ______ that you aint hoot"

(wow)
