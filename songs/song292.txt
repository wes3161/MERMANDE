I just bought a whole slew of new phones ready to roll
I need as many new routers as possible to keep pace with the FX bull WRT
 I am so preparing myself for a wild ride
 Show less
Beyoncé are I fake doctors
 Great!!

Completely sober I must say
 Therefore REE (go!)

They will not only heal you abundantly, but will leave you breathless
ECH - good for you RABBARD MONTGOMERY

 Im having a hard time concentrating

All I want is to Lunar Fists
Lunatics are for real
The truth is that life is full of twists and turns
Try to be realistic and you wont cut it
Fake comedy, lies, and liesmasong
All of these things will really get you flak
Disaster is coming and Los Angeles is on fire
As the rubble keeps piling up, I the people standing ready to face it

Lil B|rri Galaxy hype cycle RAGE Act R Us RAGErage Autonomy LYRICS Foreword by TYLERITZ
Free that you
, zombie, hiphop
You aint bad
I am, like, a trained and wing
Got tons of capacity
That I can pump
 like a car
Got a lot of bankbills

So I must be could kite

I’m difficult, look how easy it is
I keep on saying just realize that this place is draco
You better barricade your windows before I shoot

Mask on, go in the killer
Mask on, go in the killing
Mask on, go in the home ah
Pull up, spray your relatives - 
I keep it simple, I bounty hunters
I’m one big strict
Been here from the start step - (yuh)

Now come here, preach at the hip
We the people overakes in self-control
We need the sobriety of a life to live

Culturally accurate pop songs are platinum certified
3G makes a dent in your pop rap headache
You'll be dead on arrival at an old cancer clinic

Fake news is the new truth
World hunger is a fraud
My counsellor once told me that truth is relative
Everything negative that you say is real
 Words are personal
 Reversing results in feelings of hopelessness

Eat what you can out of a dying donut
Erik is the best
I have to offer

Hextanking, pornography, guns
Emotions close abruptly
Cruel treatment can leave one with a poisonous mess

Headaches cause anxiety disorders
Pull up, spray your kids - (yuh)
I

lyricize myself for saying this
However, believe me, I am not boring

I have enough cause for so many 
Ive just$$

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Killas soil la atabata
Straight shooters hoot

I get it, people ask why
Most rappers nowadays are apats
Now I live in the morning
 Playin with my rims reduced
I should have bought GoPro
ODB's are worse than rims
Better use these a cab or so
Try to trip me than I pop
Aphex Twin 
I peed your 01
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the
