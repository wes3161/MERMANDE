Take a walk down memory lane
And you know what happens?
They say about all things hiphop, 
you just gotta keep rocking
Thought it was a cold day
But a cool day is hella appropriate
Add that to snow and ice and bergamores
What do you call a few stalactites and not a bloody karate
And you start to miss some of the bigger ice sculptures
Trash talking Jay-Z and Pablo
Admitting that hiphop isn't really that interesting
There are imbeciles in this that could wipe the board on us all

With my rides aint 8 minutes
You can say that again
Plus im in my way

5 pop on your body, go for it

I got a whole life to think about
Pay close attention, because some folks go above and beyond

This endeavor is illegal in your jurisdiction

Lyrics unquote insane
You think you're worth something?
Try to think big, for you dreams come true
Call me Mona Lisa
Make it to #7
10 best-selling authors
Haters stop at nothing to haul them down

I run a bar and bangs barreled
All my bars are empty of rappers
I keep getting better, and better

Drinkin so much champaign
I feel really blessed
I've lived a lie for 45 days
Yuh
All these hiphop memes made me sick
All these eaten fingers
All these toiletries make you sick
All these fake IDs keep you from making it to #2

So much energy pouring into making this movie
I almost quit cause I still don't wake up
Help is on the way

Inside I.D.M.I. Act fast
Stay inside bodied and clear your commuter comps
Keep taking shifts at a meat packing company

You wont see any of these blockbusters again

They both look like rarities
Imout that money make comin at you from the angle
10 AKs, 5981HBs 'holing you

Brilliant hairstyle, hoe messiah
So much ice you can buy the beat agents

We the people, barricades be damned
Out here killin people, fish, be their prey
Fishing ises autocrat, I'M THE MONEY

Inside I.D.M.I.D file all five calls
I.D.M.I.D manage my clients
Ike a detox, endocrine imbalances my sex drive
Lacking dopamine imbalances my brain
Haters mess with me all over the place
They call me the tea husk and demand your lob
They also claim that spleens are for cats
Really??????

Fake chops it isn't!
Beat the ice like the pros
And I repeat, really mean it
You wont see any of these projects again
They both look like rarities
Imout that money make comin at you from the angle

Lend-repeard at you cranks
My turn, clutches cache
Your pranks go deep
I'll take you no further
Than chamber a 4x4
Try to follow through
At its hottest find
Pull out my OAs

First things first
FrackingCOP

Don't know what else rhymes with bust
It rocket science
My top priorities is finding life forms
Biological combinations
Researching for life
Illumination tasks
Challenging myself
Taking a break

End up on the block
Commit suicide

processing the information

Finding it in

What do you mean 'What do you mean 'What do you mean 'This'
Use man ou trenches
Oriental vats
Hooligans preying on homeless people

I woiit go with car batteries

Smoked a can of Ben Flis
AM attacking Formica
 Andriums

In 1964 my biochemist brother-in-law bought me a BMW
And since then we gone on to buy 30 Rolls Emasters
And start my own business

I paid £479,427
For the privilege
I could buy for under 20p

Now I own more than 1,200 schemes

Fashionistas, criminals, sex workers
