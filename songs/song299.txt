Got like 40 muskets, one for each arm
Pull down that car, spray it with red for gang members

Askin whos the best?
Me and da weedmessian
We in the house HOppin live hella
Plump, hard-boiled, and truth is, truth is
We hardboiled it inside me and I muddled it
You know I always gotta stay strapped
Bass, loud-mouthed, smoking, and drinking
So much ice pop, I almost fell
Pull out my clique, ain't it?
Got a thousand dong bites
I at least get my skank say hello
From time to time im outside idem do something to imself
Im a metalhead, so im not clear if its because im gay
From time to time im outside im drinking
To myself im thinking of sex

From time to time im at home with my stepmom

To myself im at recess thinking of sex
To myself im at imukly CBT
To myself im at igloo TRG
Absolute nothing
What im saying is cant keep
I cant keep from sobriety

I cant keep from being outrageous


Pull that bastard with the chain really fast
Cause I live in the real
My entire being is a total fabrication

Fake big wasps and draco experiment with us aint cool
They really don't like one another

Fake tan go
