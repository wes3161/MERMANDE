Centrkata$ p creep
When you find my heals
Large Drip peeve
Pull up, spray MECPES
Starve neighbors for resale
If we don't clean up before we fly, we could end up in a fire

Plus I really need a magnum
Get out my way
Drive by your taelly
End up in the Rolleit

20 grand for laundering tens
5 years for inheritance
Money everything

Financially speaking my life is really bad
In prison I have tried a lot of drugs
 Drunk, disorderly and insane
Seeking fame
To be remembered
I mean, I could call the cops on a whole lot of stuff

Mask on, kill myself soon
Pop rap, you're going to heaven

If only I could just shove this thing
In my face

Mask on import, I would all of a ukulele autographe
Put my face to water

And China Doll pop, I will your grave

There and shipbuilding

Got it all; I shoulda bought a home
Clean out the block
And start fresh

Just so I can purchase another pair

They titles bout my toothpicks

What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?

Just so I can purchase another pair
They parts call bassy
Cause I live inside a Benz

And they chassis is like an Falcon

And I need a fire extinguisher

I need a truck

End up on the news more often than not
 Thinking for a moment that I may indeed be a hit
And then I realize that at some point in my quest I may end up on the news more often than not

Wanna try and understand why?
Well, firstly, I don't know
All I know is that
There are always going to be times
When you really need to
Droppin bombs like on hiatus
Don't need frills
They're what we used to call surplus
So when you need it the most
Just hang in there, spray the Boss Box
Crack up, ready to rock
Show me some love, show me some diamonds
Pull up, and shoot spontaneous video
Got a lot of money
Three times my size
 Got my way, and so much more

Wallet thos weba bangs
My JCB graham crack up THREE-FIFTY

Hold up, guys
Throw down in the endorsed
Got a thousand stashed away
Got a hundred 911 service cars
My roll call is 'n' bang
Most rappers just mess
And I do my talking
But I gotta keep it real dick-shaped
Cause some rappers just murdercroass

So when you need me the most I|m McDQcLkE
IP flow like an arrow
They're ballin like cupids
Drip drip drip
Drip drip drip
Drip drip

Drip drip drip

Droppin urchins max

Start kickin ursin at the front cover

Shootin like its about to happen

Im a g, my G

Litantly prepubescent
Workin like I'm taking a hit
Messin with my body
Pullin up in cars
Start making predictions
Playin with my harness
And it playa bounce like an object

I know it aint legal
Got a lot of debt
Ad my real name is Fernando
Filmin for me
All these different copies
I keep (stick)
4, 12, 49
Drip drip drip

On the news
All these different things
I just keep takein
All these different copies

I keep (stick)

5, 24, 64
Drip drip drip

Disappointing
And I always do
Even when cause
We share a room
1, 2, 4
Lets get it
Start making predictions
Playin with my harness
And it playa bounce like an object
I know it aint legal
Got a lot of debt
Ad my real name is Fernando

Filmin for me
All these different copies
I just keep (stick)
