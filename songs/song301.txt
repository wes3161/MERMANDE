You're probably really sick
This hotel stays the hell up
The watering hole demon hunter
The ER reamins!

Hot damn I'm bleedin through my brain
Out here grindin stackin, grindin stackin
I got boxes full of cash
Throwdown is at an all time high

Robbity remembers your name fresh in her soul
And she knows what you need in a Brandon Marshall bio

You know I always gotta stay strapped
Theres always going to be some people that can't hear
They're never going to hear from me again

Try to copy me, copy thats for sure Not my style
Imreallllyative heart I cant readit

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I need to get rid of the organic drugs

I should probably clean myself up and put these cars down

I mean they should be model years

Try to copy me, imitate that sound

Can't read press very well
Fake degrees suck
Been here Jackass a lot
Comin along peso bullets like a tummy grenade

My stendo clip is gonna keep popping
Ill put you in more pain than a cut above
Try to Mill Hour a Manger But I Dont Run From You

Take a beat, killaps, we're join this week
Im coming here today as Papa John's
Sell me some homicide written on my rear door

I should've been roughest and charged with' murder
Cause hella burglary intestines on fire

Got so much money I could buy myself some super stupendous wealth
I could write the New York Times Obiticle

Better get the hell out my way before I do
Corrupt people with deceptive business practices
Crack down on the press like hell no tomorrow
Help me niche, big Pharma ahead of me

They askin where im bombin but I holler prevent theirs

IF YOU WANT TO PROTECT US, GET IN THE MANGERGOUS

Dont walk by me zip-tin-eq-code
Shootas at security at an autozone

Mask on, shootin like im 302 gold plated

Mask on, shootin like im 301 mask
Mask on, shootin like im em107

Mask on, pop pops like im 8m eXtrash

Mask on, pull up in the rari yahn
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up in that Lamborghini
Pull up in that Lambo
Pull up in that black Benz
Pull up in that white Ghost

Pull up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pull up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pull up in that Maybach
Pull up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I got a Murcielago on my wrist and on my neck
Im always super fly cause I own 7 private jets
I got more money in my back pocket than the IRS
Messin with my crew results in more than just a threat

I got 1, 2, 3, 4
Shootas at your front door
7, 8, 9
Dont drive a Fusion since you comin at them

I got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

Pull up in that spaceship
Cause I need my personal space
Pull up in that PlayStation
There is no one inside
Like Miley Cyrus and Khalid
I

knew nothing
Got, like, anything
X

Everything
Im the front runner

All my rides are foreign whips
