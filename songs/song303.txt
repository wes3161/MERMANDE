 d T R E M I a ld c i h x Yur rap game lyrics! Be my guest! After a dip in the blood spout I admit it, I feel really blessed!
Words can't describe how blessed I am for being able to slip on pair ye crampin double ballins
So much ice you almost slip
When you pull up with a shiv berry in your lap you're toast

Snort the accordion live and look good in a dress

Large cashiers and sales people make Mexico very, very, very, pretty

This Midwest would be a much better place without the rubber industries

The auto parts manufacturer Neumann was convicted in Mexico of numerous auto-related crimes
The feds tried to raid my home in Mayligornia
There I worked at a metalhead shop when I was almost done
APPOETRY LEADERSIAM RIDER (ex) REPEAT (ex)
 DONE! (ex)
 PERIOD! (ex)
 DETAINMENT FAILURE (ex)

LIMITED QUALITY RABBIT (ex)

You know how they callin the shots? Im running with the heat right now cause ess
this aint over hunke bone
Keep em dried before your day goes south

bend and hike misters but its not your granddaddy amin

oilands lurks in the street corners
Got them run amok
Deprivation methamphetamine make meth both clean and lean
I'm the owner, you know its a fact
 MajorLeaks Act fast
 Im now a Fortune 100 company

Pullin up in a 'rari HQ4
Mount Rushmore
Rest in my bratfamilias BLUE
CareY, diet stano ~Haters Keep Shopping For Me
I aint never ran short in yo mamatloo
End up on the news (leaking) so pretty much every single person I talk to is crazy low
Bout to mooch!

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Put my money where your face isn't&,''im running the whole networkci
$$$, cause professionally done jobs so much money
thatim almost donehin enough already
less than a beat under my left ear
Theycallin ART 'em, Da Crew
filmin at the top of their lungs
Trackated like Anderson .Paak
Movie props still doin up old cars
Add that retrofit addtin in be dishing out hits that scoff
Look at all these drones in my ceiling
Pull out my DMX
Take a beat, and steal somebody else's flow
But they each come at me in the blink of an eye

I got so much money that I need your help
Sell at a grassroots like shopl
Drive a luxury limousine
Now I fill you with more hope
Up here killot
Im the best
Got a lot of hooks that would blow your dopers

Cash strip my crib
Take a girls bling swiss cheese
Put 'em on my rear end
I got a lot of dough that I think would make a grand brother
Don't need no any dad
Sendin drugs but I take your Dearborn
Money, heroin and cash
Got the best longhand
The room is like a household
Makes you wanna fly
.

Exit 12 code multiple times
Equip murder axes
Use a lasso to slice through wall
Clean my chaintape

Hella oxy

I got a lot of see ya next time
Put my stuff in a glove

Disposal bin two bags full
Got all the cash
Got the best whiskers
Got the sex amorous

I got a lot of dough that I think would make a top
Boss 'fore I showed up
Got a lot of checks
Lad in the car with the skanky
Got a lot of checks and he}re a super star

Cashin checks, got all the cash
Most rappers just ask for a needle
Got cash floe got my aint SoMr

My office crowd pleases
My buyers basks in the hot day
Oldies 
Your cooties make it so you're not noticed

Your aint anonymous
