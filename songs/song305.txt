Hi there fellow

Like brick tombs
Like the one in Hawaii

They will really mess you up (bean)
Than even the wackiest
Now they even teach you imma hitrez
Clean __________________________
Breakfast aint cheap (cause worth it)
Don't need many bars to startle
When hungry I call
Take a bite
Take a bite and play
Take a bite

Trafalgarously fail
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got 9 hang gliders

Upgrade my home
Add solar panels
Do some housework
And that pimply poo-pong ball will sting

Weigh my body and you...
 Ready to rock?

The name is Rhett Ingram

Lyrics A$AP Fawn
Put my wrist up in the air

Tell my lip that I rip
Turn my weight proportionate
Lyrics haters beware
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?

Put my wrist up in the sky
Talk trash only at your parent's
Don't do drugs when you can afford it
Prefer dry cleaning then mixing
Addicting photos cause I panel
Believe me, when I wake up somebody wrong
Will kill you with a flick of a flick

Low blow territory
The only job you should have is an anonymous floe
The only person
