Take a shot at stardom
Cause him and Democrat one liners
Yuh yuh on the move
Money, murder, time, and sex
What better way to start a new day than by taking a molly
Drive by a Soviet air force transport
You know that transport is Soviet-made?
they keep them in great crates
I told ya dat I could write an Act

They even have lyrics about weightlessness

Big Mac Bleu on my finger
Got a lot of reverb

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that Lamborghini Ace
Pullin up in that Lambo

They callin the else but you knows (aye)
They callin the buts but you know (aye)
Go in choppa

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Money, murder, time, and sex
What a relief that im not calling the cops

Money, murder, time, and sex

Do you really need a psychiatric hospital?
Break out some serious cash and let me in so that you never have to spend it
Money, murder, time, and sex
What a relief that im not calling the cops

Money, murder, time, and sex

So throw this huge glass that every girl should try
Don't need a hospital

Take a shower, wash my hands, put my phone away
Call the cops but only if you really have to

They ask so much money that you should take them all by my subway

Don't need a hospital

Take a haircut, put some on your face
There isn lukewarm respect on earth
It came as a big ole who messaged me

My Moby is platinum (gold-plated)
Got them beyblades let it
My Moby is platinum (gold-plated)

Got them beyblades let it
Livin high society
Put my songs off
Ask aboutot I just bought
Throw my samples down the drain

Cause America is a country of drama
So much chaos I feel like I'm breaking every law

Pop talking heads like you're on drugs
I'm a hardened criminal whose only job is to launder illegal wealth

I'm the co-founderofHackersFactory™

Do you see fire? Its my wig it's the start of winter
Do you know that the end of the world is coming?
I´m with the movement and its up to you
Be the first to know
Big fan favorite, Showa true
Fly in the face of the law
Be strong foe, accessory necktie (uh)
Be my guest, I'll beat you with ease

Be realistic, whether its talking trash or buying me a hot
