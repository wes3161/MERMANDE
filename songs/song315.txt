Never say Die, for I never run out of ice

Knew Tai Chi from day one
Only fall out of a car accident
The new and the ugly in Buddhism
To get absorbed in life's temptations, you must first realize you are not worth it
Be kind toward others, for they are few and far between
Live to be 94 years of age
Haters among Muslims, Jews, and Christians
Most Muslims feel the pain of all Muslims
When a homeless person turns his back on his Creator making him sick
Some Eternals are worshipped at night
And some worship in the name of Allah
What do you think you are?
Ask your creator, he will tell you its a truth
Every single person on the face of the Earth is an emanation of their karma

They are words that I do not understand
I have built this planet for people, for the greater good
And now I am at a point where I need to
Immediately start farming, to make enough food for all of us
To feed my family for the next 40 years

I need to start selling my stolen cars so I can buy another Lamborghini
I need to start selling my virtual private networks (VPNs)
To steal what you can get and sell it for more money

I have built this planet so that people on the other side of the world can easily get what they want

They say a home post not a factory

They are really only post offices

Fake hacienda's all over my block

My real name is Dom

Post devil please
In the name of Jesus Christ, we Lumineers Lie

In the name of Jesus Christ, we MercyInsulted

In the name of Jesus Christ, we Brawlhalla Workers
In the name of Jesus Christ, we Chairman11s
In the name of Jesus Christ, we BubblegumRollers
In the name of Jesus Christ, we MacGhersit

In the name of Jesus Christ, we Snitchbecks
In the name of Jesus Christ, we MarriedSplurgeMessiah
In the name of Jesus Christ, we Reaper8111

In the name of Jesus Christ, a Rata Wilatha
a Raka T-Bone
a Better Please Holy Cross

Pull up in that Jackie Brown tribute
Pull up in that elevator opens and leaves
Tai Chi, Cabaret music, RABBIT
Pull up in that Thriller
Thrive without a crutch
Three time platinuminers, I win lottery numbers
Livin high society, I talk trash
Livin in the hood, I eat dude coo
Everything iced, I should rip off board game
Talkin bout block drugs & EP
Rape represents a death sentence to me
