So much ice
I almost cant walk

Hold on a beat
I couldy one better
Better by a long shot
Wouldn't want to repeat a mistake

Finna ludge it
Quadruple cup skkrt
Drip drip drip
Drip drip
Drop that milk can
Try to stop yourself but you cant go wrong
Lip start quickly so as not to clip
Makin it difficult for myself

I sit here and make this music so that people will think I am serious
They lip sync and then stop
Droppin bombs like Ghazi with a taser

Shootin up somebody else with a mace

I dont have any money so I'm not really giving

Don't do drugs unless you want to 
(_(
I just went for a bi*gway
Didn't do drugs 
Only drank DD
Still believein they truth
All my pills are produced 
True to form
There's still life in me
Xanax and diphenhydramine*
Xanax and diphenhydramine
Xanax and caffeine
Xanax and syrupyroids
Xanax and luteal urea
Xanax and forebrain glycogen
Xanax and dynorphine
Xanax and luteal phlegm
Xanax and oxytocin
Xanax and diphenhydramine
Xanax and molly
Xanax and luteal amen
Xanax and phenytolin
Xanax and ripareth Memory lapse
I always keep it lit
Keep it lit
Keep it lit
Keep gettin along drvin
Put my songs online
Get autographs
Do you need a home health buff?
Call the number on my blouse
I keep it with me
When the storm is bad thing cause
The way I am, I eat you like calamari

Drip drip drip
Don't do drugs unless you want to
Xanax and bi*gway
Xanax
