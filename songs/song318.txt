I bought this Benz 100 years ago for an old sickass florist
Wipe my back and forth like guest lines
And cause shyness, guilt and anxiety levels rise

I am the most private person you know
I gave you so much, you would rather not know

You little things matter because they really are
So much more than just a slice of cancer

Improvise to yourselves and skkrt
Just so I can say something dumb
So i'll just clear my upset up
Then I can start over
Start with the beginning and we'll get to them

Anyways, at the end of the beginning I just said no

All this bling bling like im saying I am
All this jewelry underneath my jacket
What the heck is that?
Hold up, younger gentlemen
