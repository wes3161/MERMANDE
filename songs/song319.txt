As Marlboro and Hankook

If you want to keep it one word; clear
You cant pass sobriety
Show me a greater need
Thousand percent animal biota
Depression puts many marching band members at risk
My more desperate patients thrive on Solutionamine

Quadruple cup ramblings faster
My ranged assault rifle kills all insects
Even some homeless people need a distraction

Quadruple cup imminently distortion
Pull up straight in that Dodgers game killin

Time to step up and play
Secret life im Roast 
Lyrics always the bad guy
The one that tells the truth
When you find out that someone is a criminal
They people then call the cops
Trash talking cops
There are dental dams in every home

Out here suckin death, nothin to worry bout

Another time around,
a L.A. woman
asked me what I was bout, and
The first thing I say is "No"
�I just went for it
Got a lot of money
Got jobs too
Got my way with more money

Dogging, saying how I�m �good hiding knots
Makin dough, folding tables
Caressing onions, snatching up chickens

Dogging, saying how I �am �real �fulness
To myself �imbas a gallant
