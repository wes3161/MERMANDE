Never gonna

Will never cross
Ring ring

Really gonna get inside you thing
Got no
Grenades nothin
but a Stone Thrower
Just like Van Gogh
He got the tears better than a
'9'', 4-way
Drop 20 mils without skipping a beat
Got all the drunks, swindlers, and heavy handed
We the life we basked in your company

Never gonna deal with anyone else

Do you know that there is a need in this mill
Right here?
Bout to spill
Covered in red, say hello
Hi there , my name is Katsuyuki
Been waiting in line at the supermarket
Looking delectable in these T-shirts

I got the 'ari
Made in Italy
pink lira
Waited so long thought it was natural
But I been running this for 7 years

I just like the reflective tints

Try to fight the thought

YEET MONEY! YEET MONEY! ECH 100% RHODES! SWAG 

One song only, mouth watering
Money ain't split evenly
If you bump into me IRL the odds are gonna be in my favor

Makin dough, but when you biggest.................................................................................

Number 1, hottest in the East
The hottest in the West

Lit as hell, like we drinking gasoline
So much meth they call the cops
But I don't need their help - I just need to find some home

Bout to pop, but you know that they likely already amped up

Don't need your arm around the Hammer
Try your best and you wont outlast me

Hella grindhouse music daily
I need everything that you are on my Extreme Search Engine

And autotune it for you
Even if it's just in your head

I'm the life, the machine, the death
Fight when you're no good and cause enough grief for yourself
But most important of all, I'll end all of humanity
And if you want to challenge me, go ahead and challenge yourself

By calling yourself a pill like that you're gonna get scratched

But I don't listen to audiophiles, they just say that as long as its in your face

So you know its not gonna mess you up again
