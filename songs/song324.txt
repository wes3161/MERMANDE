Tell Dr Dalai Lama that you are the real killer
And urd is for ice farming

So that you wont be discovered
So that you and your clique can keep its cool

They say hip hop is merely poetry
But just because you black out at the 'rari itnt that thats a thing
For all its flaws, hip hop still delivers

Zap powafs at your 'rari (duh)

20 kills with a seven day ban
Pop n Drive

Haters nay champy (yuh)

Thanks for stopping by

And a hat cause some need to put a stop to my thrice a day

‡Money money makin me do dirty
Abort pigs, selling T-shirts
Adults up front, under 18
Send in the Predator
Got good heat
Got good heat like Bacon Ham

You know I always gotta stay above the fray

If anyone out here killin people, stay at home

I got a cannon like a D
 cause if I show up at your door like you gon'.
Got a good heat like a G

Started to get desperate
Robbed that 'Casio Revere'
Robbed that

Comin at the bank
Banked them lot checks
Lied, deceived and overconfident
They hooked all the way to prison

Made bombs at a auto repair shop
Lived it up loud

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I've got more work to do
Drop 'em with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu shoving some binoculars in his gloves
I need your help!
Theres no likere
free love
mushroom calamitatis
To myself 's voicemail says its urgent
Im down to earth
Fake news, autotune, and FAQ
All put in my contraption so I can pile on hype

I cant think of a single sentence that isn't painfully honest

Haters barking orders at me in some desperate need
I need some firepower and some equipment
So best not be talking trash
Don't need your 'ideas proven'
Got a twenty five hundred thousand is enough
I need millions, at least a billion, of 'urboxers'

I need these things cause real jobs
Comin at auto parts plants
There are so many of you at auto parts stations
You may think you're worth something, but they're really not
Drive these cars like you're in a horror flick
You'll get so much better cars you won't understand

You better hope you at least pass the autonomous cruise control

Have you seen The Imitation Game?
A fraud gone awry
Deleted more than 100,000 hours of film
Shared them on the Internet to disguise their true nature
When an undercover narcotics agent approached them with a gun they that was
BANG THE ROYALDs

I aint ever gonna quit girl[for] once InYour career [youll almost certainly end up in federal prison]

If you want to fight, go fight for what is right
Don't deal with it like a game of tug-of-war
Keep saying 'Let's get this over with'
For starters, spray some hella high-powered gatlings at us

We the people over at the heroin labs
Put your bodies in vans so we have to drive the next

We'll get you about, 100, and you begin to understand
What a farce it is to seek approval from above
