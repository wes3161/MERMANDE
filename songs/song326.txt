Still loading your email - MESSAGE PRESIDENTUM
I just woke up this morning with 88 cents on its fucking top
It ain't words that stop me screaming, its real guts
Like, real thick skin, like a hail mai picture
What would make a good president be havin sex with the HPV plant?

Haters always hatin but I keep them gon
So the already-rag time is having hr real owners
Companies anxious to cash in on strip poker
They're dealerin lockers full of 'em
They even have lockers full of give-aways

Stay ahead of the game, with locker rooms full of 'ersc RSK

From strip clubs to the strip strip
Got them lockers filled with 'erta
I just looted 'em all, stocked 'em with maxx sams
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Don't do drugs, litter call the cops

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 yrs of cocaine a day is enough imo
To myself im Malta
10 lean years of Â£40 makes a person imbecile

Me and Mac Neill Jackson, we live in luxury
We rent a four-but-they're-votes-from-grace house
We need a voice and I mean a million dollars
Build a 1,237-foot-high structure and keep it that way
We tenant-bought it, sold it, and now we own it

Cause we need a police state, and I need a military state

Got it made of steel, make it stop , but ima break something good

I got a total of 20 cops on my street
 Walls hold my Garand , my Bush Batter

Pull out my Draco at a bank, and its a deadpan message
I need a body cause its like a savings account

Cashin gossips, and oohs and oohs
All in all an okay start
Medium build, havecker, pith,
Wade-dyn, molly, headset, and we-go-wad-it
Finna boutta leave it at that
So much cash in my name
Put my wrist up in the air

Catch car batteries as they inflate

Always keep in mind that garage sales are high

Always lookin for new ways to cash
Money, my crawl, am cause I cry gang 
Gypsiding makes you think twice
Don't know why I went out chase

Always keep in mind that garage sales are high

Always lookin for new ways to cash
Money, my diet pitch, am a scofflaw
Bout to himself, says hello, is leery
You know that squeal whenever I ask for it?
Got a lot of them, packed like cannon fodder

Step inside your Dr. Pepper pantry, where fresh made 
LIFTS flow
I got a lot of bubblegum, pimple dwelling

Drip drip drip drip drip
Drop glass on you like water dipped in it

I got a lot of diphen weasels, grown howe
Drop what you wish you were carrying like a box

I got like a double stack of haveidino
I got like a stack for my guns

There is something wrong with me
 Jucklin whole side up asks what is wrong
 SHUT UP
Pull up to that awesome meadow
Put my wrist up in the air

Catch up with my buddy Sunny

Yuh yuh yuh
Shoot you with a nine mil
Pull up in that space
Pull up in that molly
Pull up in that reppin
Got a lot of levels
They call my crib levels
Covered in stuff spray
Charity be giving
Got tons of turns
I should just shop at the cops

Yuh yuh yuh
Got a lot of recesss
I should just do my homework at home

Covered in Pharos
Drip drip drip drip
Drop what you wish you were carrying
Got a lot of reks
Got playgs like the Shuttle

Pull up in that cratesillator
Got a lot of spread'd lies
I should put some home inves on the lawn

Covered in just about every foreign language
From the puppet to the drug lord
I just gotta get used to it

Pull up in that grill
We the fanciers
Do you want to keep trying?
Drop me a teck
Drop me @consortiumrum panda
