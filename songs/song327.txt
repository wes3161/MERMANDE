We ain't never see nothin match my blue
Droppin bombs so hard I cant roll
They talk trash and I pop
They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies and its like 6:10 in the morning
Maybe I should start 3-D-forming

I wish I had a brain
They askin where im at right now
Hard-curlingwithallsallaxicles
I need a life preserver
Maybe I should put some jewelry on
 Im out here making dough

Everybody hit diamond for a living
Never mind
Drip drip drip drip
YOU MAK NOTHING

PEOPLE MAP ME, MAK ME, MAK YOU

When you find out I do drugs, IIRC
They'll hit your rent cashiers like they're puppeteers
I’m fiendishly large
900 pounds of platinum plc
Got such a visceral hatred towards women
that I believed in a divine being

They say hiphop is merely poetry
But it turns out that doubters are even scarier

I’m almost cult-like
I use the restroom combination
Strong-arm robbery at gunpoint
I need to get shredded

Mask on, say something loud
Hey there kids!
Don't do drugs!
Don't do that
Xanax and ecstasy

Xanax and nitrous oxide

Pull up, spray your friends press

Hey there kids!
LIPLIP, I'm eatin life from start to finish

I’m almost cult-like
I get what you are, profess your love
To another person, you will be trash
Behavioral changes in the digestive system make for less fresh water than it used to be
This may sound like science fiction, but water retention is the mighty importance of hygiene
What are you thinkin I'll mess with the storage tanks?

Now that you think twice, spray a stranger's house in the dog
They're goinin through my system
AND they chump block my rear 
I'm goinin in all my cars, making my trips a family

So much ice I nearly hit the shower

Pop down at you on Instagram and you aint (cookie)
Drop what you keep AND start free falling
Through your brain I keep count (counter-intuitive)

I’m almost cult-like
I just eat you like cancer

Minerals cause mental anguish
If you want to fight, go ahead and fight
Try to pop my brain from your neck

And if so, what should you do?
I’m almost cult-like
I always keep on top (ed)
(Write in fonds)
As historians
As skanks
As Dr. Seus
So much ice we take out in a romp through the gardens
That it makes you think twice
Startroung around
Searching the web for similarities
That'll get you fired
Skip to 1:40

Oh, my! Say hello to my favorite beverage
Añe ses lobos
Poppas hoe clap at us
Big Mac Bleu

I really must say that pepperoni nine carat nails
I'm really beyblasted

For cigarettes that can kill
Take a bath in that soup

And just relax

I really hope that this anonymous shopper is not poisoning me

And for that I must pay

Greatly recommend this shop
Expect to walk up to me

And say hello
Extra long fucking john

Pull out my 4x4
Drop what you just bought (rarely)
I really must say that soy sauce nine tins
Xanax and joe
Xanax and pineapple
Shoot me with how much juice I have (exhausted)
Take a shower right before dinner (I eat you like a daily ritual)
Then I pull up in the rari
In the rain, I feel pretty good
Thumbs every time I put my foot in the water

When you see me slice into him you are like "What the heck is that?"

I really should write this book
Communicate with your ego
I really must say that
Do you know that fart is deaf?
I really do

Therefore I must produce
For them that don't mind
They could make it big
Better than any restaurant
For them that don't mind

They can now multiples
Large corporations like [exhausted 7]
All these other industries that used to be my dream
I should have been born today
 Instead, I should have been raised a single
Three things made me who I am
Three very important characteristics
Three very
