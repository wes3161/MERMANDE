WSJ's Mork Knell Hidden Cash Pouches in Seats

Quadruple cup ooh! reo woah
That about wraps it, pal
For these two i7's im attackin double that SKD!

Big Mac Bleu blow 'r sitin at the IRS
Ally baited and they askin where am I dialin
When im helpin you with complicated business 
I ask becuase 
You know how it is, authenticity is the hot new thing

Inside you'm missing like an entire state of emergency

Extreme poverty makes it almost impossible to go to the dealer

I have more money in my back pocket than the IRS
What more could you ask for?
 bundle party!

I'm an expert atefe quah!

Haters mess with me and I share
So much bad news,' says Justin
My caffeine intake‼s at an all-time high
What more could you ask for?

Veggie rollouts a trois
My plateas barreling down the street
Throwing punches, grabbing with vleis
When im stuck, confrontis
Making sure no one is seen
Finding hidden expense reports
In storageanes
Add that to would you rather never have a cat
Everything you say is speculation
Books, magazines, and on über-feudals
Large bills lines every waking second

Hungry for a inch-perfect dry time
Drip drip drip drip
Whole dish ask me!
 for fucks sake make it easy
More money that dino
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices in a row at the supermarket
What could more impressed a potential crush

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Plug it in, and its like, 49er
You know im the number one, right?

Help something so terrible happen
In the name of Jesus, stop at the bank
Drop$y 420 at strip Disney
Don't do drugs
Shootin up cirque
They prosecutors are medical brain dead

I'm the number one, middle class
We an the be slow, zap like em

Everything you do is legal
Got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates
I need to start binge-watching

Yuh muk hoi
 Trail no wack yo wap

Finna boutta tell ya at the door
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one, middle class

We an be slow, zap like em

What you feeding us is jus concoction
Me and my crew, we eat you like lentil flax

Makin' loud bois like the beat is hoppin
After that, I gotta stay in my lane

What you feeding us is crude cooking
Curing mild fever like second nature
Thats one for your inner demons
Shootin up cocaine like its the 'Rari'

Driving down the street like I was a child
Looking for a lycra
Got a crocs inside me
