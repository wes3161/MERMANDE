To myself
I really should write
All these lyrics
Offensively so
Im always gonna burst
All these lyrics
Sadistically so
I should make babies
Out here killin people
If its your birthday
Just so you know
What you saying?
Just do your research
Before you start
Before you know it
You gon start getting skanky
Start calling the cops
Count me as one
Do you want to play?
Call me George
Call me Lil J
Call me Knighthand
Call me Fantasy
Now that that out of the way
You're just now discovering
Im a minor rebellion
Shootin up a whole lot of banks
What would you do if you had to walk in my shoes?

I got a different take on things
You know for that long you gonna throw up

Don't know anything else
They askin where im from and what im tellin
 So much birdcage
Don't need no trying so much puttin it off before youhstick

When you looking in the mirror
You start to think im fake
Cause as a whole sound message got's a lot like
You know for some reason
I don't slip and thats why im your critic

All these other rappers sound like total trash
Really?
They almost are
All these different smokes just keep on getting better

Look at all these different coloredãƒ rhs
You know for that long you gonna throw up

Don't know anything else
They askin where im from and what im tellin
 So much birdcage
Don't need no trying so much puttin it off before youhstick

When you looking in the mirror

You start to think im fake
Cause as a whole sound message got thats a lot like

You know for that long you gotta keep it in the back seat

Better
