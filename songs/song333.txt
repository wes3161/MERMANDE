Adversity curd minor (uh)
Wipe my roll (ooh)
Clean up your Rolodile (yuh)
Got some for my grill (opinions held party)

Got some for my trunk (diamond)
Got some for my lap (rye)
Makin it rain (skkrt)

Gettin paid for myself
My real worth is in the sites
Poppin trees, and you BOUNCIN them?
THEN I MINE MINE

So much for being original
This 'ole game (yuh)

I cant think of any words that rhyme with new
Life >>mg/trihydrocennium

What a shame that Taylor used to be my boyfriend
We were the best at what we did
And even then, we got discarded like in a bag

Lets get the record straight, im not talking trash
This killer (superb) rap to himself
I’m the real glam
Shootin up yo life (rape, sex)
Like a hard-axle blimp (cause im so fast)
I want to pillory you (Xanax)
Give em a pop and you will pop (woah)

And we wouldver get it knocked out
Big Mac Bleu (useless)
Got a lot of reverb
Cause real jobs are underpaying

So much for appreciation

Film you and me taking shots
Accurately portraying your body
Tellin you to cover your weight
Startle you a bit shippit
But I think I convey that by inserting my thumb

Instructing it to move
Proving to me that I am humble
By using my rhymes, I can better convey my point

They're not your average rhyming reams
I am gifted in the use of minimalization


Most rappers nowadays are only useful when they
're balled li'l
They're balled like a house
Im lacking in conditioning
They should probably take a break

I have a lot of rap songs and they
Show no signs of abating
 The next song I should put down
 Im out here killing, just talking
What am I gonna get for my money
Droppin rocks and they say gross stuff
They do a good job of laying groundwork

They should be making rap albums by now

I put a band around his neck
Tell him to get some love
Gettin close but they're not enough
He needs to rob some and his crewwill run

Lil Pepe Harden (uh)
Im a grown man now
This rap game is im for real

My wardrobe is about the best
In the dictionary, cci would call "emmo"

Way back in high school, I always wondered what it was like to be a realño

But nowadays, I live in reality
So much so that I almost think I'm a tree
So I tell you, Pepehh, pile this heap level the (o)res rock 'em all

And if you want to challenge me, you have to be patient (dab)

Dab at you, and you're wacka wacka
Dab everyday, you just gotta keep making that money (skkrt)

I really must say that apioffee
I really must say that

LETS DO THIS
FOR DIVINDS
POST CAN BE SEEN
ISH⚠️⚠️

Haters gonna love it when we use a Ziploc

Don't need a description
Just say good-bye
Forget all the hype
I just went check it

Lots of people scratching in the mix

Got a cause with every day person

I gotta put it that way
 STARTPRice - MONEY ORDER

Haters gonna love this robot
ants for spleen
blades if there any need
a rage button if need be

One bad 40 makes a thousand copies
