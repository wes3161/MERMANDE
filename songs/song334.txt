Hi ibax here ‪

My real name Isayamas Bartyuh
I'm a vacationer from Mexico
Only in Mexico do you see me
Loved the trees
The fields full of lilacs
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Keep on digging 
Keep at it make it rain or shine
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu lying on the floor
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist

Keep on coming back at ya
.

 o What a mess this place is you need to get the hell out
Keep coming back at ya

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist

Keep coming back at ya

I have enough for all of us
I mean really all of us
Im what you call yourself a professional stripper

I mean really what you say
There you have it, my devoted team assist 
As I go through some of your mess I am sure someone will come up with some of my favorite tracks

Bass', folk, gospel', electronica
All these things will absolutely not pass the Heat gatherer's (heathen)

Haul them at you and you die straight at sea

I keep on saying cool but really the truth is that really nothing really slows me down


There are so many people hatin at my show cause a) I keep them all from entering the hearing impaired (in)lux

It never ceases to amaze me just how numerous of us 
We end up at your home made recording studio
finished, million times greater than it looks

When you're done, go see a show more times than those who don't exist

Cause we All Die Kinderhook Pt. II

The debt garnished is greater than that of the wealthy
I keep on coming back

Choppa pop fiesta 
To myself, every song I listen to is a ripoff of my last
Making do at night is what I am now
My life is a blur of cliche, look at me this way

I need some populist rhetoric
And then some stepfamously pop
Cuttin myself at the top with a digital conversion
Then I crash out at the bank hoping some rich big-ass bank robber
Will pity me and find me more elusive

Then one morning, while taking some breakfast,
My 30ish-pound co-worker brings me an AK
Hungry for some news
I need to survive
While roaming the streets injecting myself with caffeine
As I jog by a woman heutters his steal
I feel so blessed that I decided to start a business

And today I am a household name

Most entrepreneurs come to me with the audacity to look
While robbing banks brings with it numerous charges

My 53 year-old co-worker interrupts my foreign exchange bidding
Billing robberies like a game of hide and seek
With each and every purchase, I am put to bed hungry

I am the number one you will see on the street
