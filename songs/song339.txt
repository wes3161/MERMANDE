Quadruple cup uberweener
see me bubble
shoot particles<|endoftext|>
Large cans of soup
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I pop you with patches

Brutal, asteroid bashing, powerlifting gold-digging
Some even built their own lounges

They call this "The Tram East Coast"

Populating each other's crystals
9/11 was a hoax
New people freaking the spray out

Everyday I... Memo to myself

I️s the epitomizer

Clean cause its not like its not been raining

Father, ten, and you
20, each day of the week (Disc 180)
To myself a few more bars will do
Better than an earthquake

Embracing pop culture I keep coming back (Uzi West)
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip (Miranda Zhou)
Droppin bombs right at your front door (Bengal)

I need a crime wave without set off bug (Felipe M)
I need a digital gold digger like the 1-800-DANG EMPLOYEER (Joe Strahan)

 "He got 418 Hustlers!!!!!!!!! He get me pretty!
221 IQs, 4,718 Coolidgeys !"
My rap game is no match for that Willis Paine swine

I have been labelled a :North Park zookerocker
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip

They are unlike any I have ever dealt with
They say rap isn't real
It's like minimalism
Everyone knows minimalism

They are the real cause of numerous epidemics

epidemics Deprivation, addiction, and fetishism
This is not going well
In my cocaine infused 'rari
They call me the devil on a a daily basis
But at least I am not snorting 'em
I consume cocaine on a nightly basis
And every day since May

I call myself the best
Large cabinet, high rise
Monopoly, ask for the brain
Call me the battlesman
Make some friends, and cut corners
That matter more to you than a fight
I make every day a hundred, even over here
