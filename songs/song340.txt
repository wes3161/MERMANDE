This thing wants to sail you like a airplane
Drop you with the stendo clip
Feels like gasoline makes the cut
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't touch

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz
Then I pull up in the rari
With my shooters you'll be sorry

My armory, expansive
My catapult aint passive
Tha barret is be massive
My draco is mag at will
Lacking drive, I feel like I'm in my late fifties

Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see
Hella grape juice, clear pee
Going in like a rental car
Comprated, but not disappointed

I really need a routine run
The living room is the ultimate snorkel

Seating is massive
Poppin rows like a home

My grill is raking milk
I cant eat

Disastrous, Veuve Cette
This restaurant stays open like a cult

My mouth is criminal
Help me god, this restaurant explodes

Having a gay pride celebration
On my stove and on my mantel

Getting rich quick like Jimmy Wang
Messin with me like a flicka da wrist

Shootin up full a homeless person
They callin the cops but you know that this aint a game
I got a grill like Jason B game is like Origin

My grocery list is strewn with chain mentions
Like their chicken slaughterhouse
I'm the next John Wayne
Just so you know, im real girlizing

My grill is criminal
Help me god, this restaurant explodes

Having a gay pride celebration

On my stove and on my mantel

Getting rich quick like Jimmy Wang

Messin with me like a flicka da wrist

Shootin up full a homeless person
They callin the cops but you know that this aint a game
I got a grill like Jason B game is like Origin

My grocery list is strewn with chain mentions

Like their chicken slaughterhouse

I'm the next John Wayne

Just so you know, im real girl realizing

My grill is criminal

Help me god, this restaurant explodes

Having a gay pride celebration

On my stove and on my mantel

Getting rich quick like Jimmy Wang

Messin with me like a flicka da wrist

Shootin up full a homeless person
They callin the cops but you know that this aint a game

I like a nine nucleus supremacy

Pullin up in that Buick
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in in that
My grill is criminal

Help me god, this restaurant bursts
My grill is criminal

Help me god, this restaurant bursts

Lets get this under control
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that Benz

Pullin up in in that
My grill is criminal

Help me God, this restaurant bursts
My grill is criminal

Help me God, this restaurant bursts

Now I don't need your money (ayy)
Just use my mouth
Call me champ
All in for a dollar
Take a beat on my name
All in for a beat on my name
All in for a beat on my name
All in for a beat on my name
All in for a beat on my name
All in for a beat on my name
All in for a beat on my name
All in for a beat on my doll

I need your voice in my life
Bout to die BABY
(ayy)
(ayy)
(ayy)
(ayy)
(ayy)
(ayy)
(ayy)
(ayy)
(ayy) (ayy)
(ayy) BLUE
ON
OKAY
All right, now you know
What I'm saying is a commodity
A robbery could put me in a lout's league

My loud side likes to say sorry
And when I say sorry
