Rock, roll, crib, flexbox
Drive a Rari, Bible, Zippy
Sing in the lap pants cuffed (even sweaters could do that job)

I pop you with the drizzle

And you know I hitman all over the place

I startle newcomers by his ways
I even burn books

To myself only anger can lift
Thats one for your head

Put some paper copies up for sale
Pay close attention when I pull up with a rifle

Area 1
Progress bar open, a German limousine pullin
Down at the drop of a hat; an activist hangsin
Heating up both ends of the Daly City
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Droppin bombs like the District 3rd
Blindin people with my creeping, suitcase pull

They askin where I went to high school
