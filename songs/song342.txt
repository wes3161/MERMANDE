Disguise|I make ice cream

Quadruple cup it, makin ice cream cones
Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Bangladeshis body bags
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between your eyes
Finna boutta gonna have a drive-by
Tap the trigger twice and you die BANG

Versace Versace Versace
All these other rappers just copies of me
Run the game got the lock and the key
What you fakers need is a lobotomy

AYE that’s how we roll
Wasn’t raised a quitter so i'm never gonna fold
Everything iced got a toilet made of gold
Look at all these platinum plaques I just sold (uh)

Got mansions maybachs chains and rollies
We in the house like my homeboy Corey
Three eyes open so you clowns can’t roll me
Got a draco cause I never call the po-lice

Ca$h Floe and i’m cashin out
Got a new rari how you feel
Im lacking hella vitamin D

Ca$h Floe and im cashin in

Messin with my crew and we gon bustin ass

Money found my philly home full ofwas goin yeeling

drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Bangladeshis body bags
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Lipity loppity
momidy robbity
 tongue so floppity
 Lay on back a house full of crows
I’m cashin out
That one time I need to evict you
You fake hip
2Pac inside myself
iland back except for at the end
FUCK EEEEEEE

Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Bangladeshis body bags
There a ways from here on out
I’m cashin out

Do you want to cause combat I’m across your brain
Squeeze the above at you before I send the shockwaves
With my whip you'll be hit with crushing truth
When you think you're covered in dust I'll send you straight to hell

Killa a crucial stably for your defense
We must defeat this devil before he drags his army into this new world

I'll take you like a molly (skkrt) and you mow your own future insolvency

I'll eat your nothings and your executable your software
Interrupt your conversations and make you doubt your lifelong dreams

I'll cause total chaos in your day-to-day dealing
I'll find every illegal plant in your yard and throw them all to the winds

I'll be their barricade and your medicinebox

Quadruple cup it, floppin awake at 7:40

I’m milking it like home indulgence
All these other drinkers flooding the room
I'm drinking them all at once

I’m ending my day with the tip

I'm consuming them at a leisurely clip

Do you even care?


Collect my cryptocurrency
And spend it on pizza
ONI Buffalo
And super stupendously high
Pizza truck drive PLENTI DIGITAL
My daily routine is THE EYE OF TRACYRE
My recess only inches
Sometimes I have to flick a switch

Turns out that even if it ain’ts cash crunch
(ayy) then I have my' all
While you’ll be touched
 Im EDITION DIGITAL

Drip drip drip
Disposable DIGITAL

Large Dok cyber currency
