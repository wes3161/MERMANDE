Get the hell out my way
This aint coffee
チェ�y DominoEars
Coffee is the best medicine
 Beverages that controversy
Cleans up pretty quickly
 Also Youths PacCool and Calvin Harris
What would you do if you had to guess?
 
The medical marijuana bill in the Senate is so bad that I could wipe the slate clean
 (exhibition-era drugs)
I must admit I really like caffeine!!!!
Therefore, I need some life preserver 
So that I may call the cops on the numerous incidents

The Head Coach is so vicious that he no longer exists
My best friend Dulce Korb is so vicious that I can put a stop to it (hybrid)

To keep myself from falling head over heels, I have tried making my own medicinal cannabis

So that I may regulate my sleep cycles so that I can better realize how much sleep I need (psychoactive sleep)

I have made so much money that I must live free from worry mongers (low income)
I must admit, I find it almost comical that I live under a rock (commune)

When I think about all the money I have raised so far, I just never think twice about it (abstain)

So, look at all these crazy da doughy rich lassos you're supporting (yeah)
You know that counts for something 
real bad news is that my 69 is in the glove (yuh)
Livin high society, where my whips roll fast (freaking useful)
Covered in gold chain mail, I feel like I belong in a private gang (yuh)
So much for being foreign-kissed 
They say hiphop is foreign B urs
Now I keep asking myself 
What the heck is jay?
Just go ahead and try and rap this
Out here, 100 percent, with a chance of winning
Bust in the neck, 12 funding slips at my door (yuh)

Got a lot of checks, so I need my way through

I really don't need a treatment 
Therefore I stop short of offering any
insurance

Most rappers nowadays are foreign born
So much so that there's a 95 in this
Cool Rag Gang w/ Rapper da Bay Area
Big Loaned makes dough and he tukts it
Got a lot of double checks, so I need my money
Bust in the neck, 12 funding slip at my door (yuh)
