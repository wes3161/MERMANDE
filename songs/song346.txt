Who told you otherwise? Better safe than sorry.Clean, you ain't legislat'
Inclined juicers just fine
Just hit the bumpinin', cause I own more gold bars than platinum ones
This in and of my face, more like gold dust than gold chains
All these watches are actually Rari mal
I got multiple wristwatches in my possession
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My expansive life employing numerous home-bought luxury vehicles
While taking in the azaleas
Grandve you with a crown made of gold
Tell people "they aint flabby"

I blame my caffeine junkies
Someone told me AA was a lifesaver
UDEC is for illicit drugs
What a shame im that im quaking pretty hard
I got so many drownin in my pass
When I pull up with them on the street
Cigarettes are everywhere
Im futile at ease
Im lacking spirit
All these other blessings
I just really like mixing and dosing
Cigar smoked sit still
