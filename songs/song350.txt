The Internet isn't real 
Haters
Try to mess with me
End up on the news - all about me
As a result, I tend to turn tired
And men are a-killas
So much water I almost lose my footing

And I drown
So much water I just need a dip
Start again, taller!

Than you
The one in purple


Teenagers
Im having a hard time keeping my tears perforated
It took me
5 vaccines
Giving my polio
PrEP (permanent blockhead)
For menopause
I was so depressed
I stopped taking
The only medicines I tried that made me better
Was polycythemene

Big Mac Recker
Large Bag 1U
Haters
Bosers

Haters would cook at
tramps
(ain't put them to bed)

I am the new Jimmy
Out with the name recognition manual
Keep making that money
My future always sunny
Never worry bouta thing
Keep it onehunnid

Diffuse it cause someone else could crush it

Money truck never a favorite
To myself im Kilowatt-argon
Got the best triceps I have ever seen
I eat like an adolescent

I‚Äôm ludicrous
Up next is Dolph Ziggler
He lost his cool at a country road show
And made money betting
Drive-by shootings saved his parents' lives

They were 33 and divorced
When Zigg. I ¬≠m your fool:
I would kill for a landline, but an old homogenizer grabbed my brain
Text¬≠ed, ¬≠sedate and ¬≠produced
 my fool's errands
Got a punchline, your homogenizer
Got a foreign name, that rhyming with ¬≠violence
Got like 20 years in prison (end of original)

Got about and done with this 1, 2
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex‚ÄîI can do three levels (enter sneak)
Poppin on the brake stack ∆í‚Å∞∆í‚Å∞ ∆ô
Pull up in a 'rari
Lit as hell, like we drinking gasoline
Pull out my Avenger, spray it to the beat
Pull that policear with a metal strip
Attach a cup to your head, so that you cant hear
When I go inside, my employees ∆ì ∆îur snap
Appreciate that humor
When I'm not doing my job, I go out in the street
Blind my employees with my dogs
Alone, confused and clueless
In the checks, I earn more
My compensation is that my hiss so the cops know it
They bust my cocaine with myÔøΩs
When I call the police, I live to tell the stories

Thon about Ludacris ∆ôs bars I pop
My stepmom called the copsin 1, 2
She told tha girl im gay
They even labelled me a diss
Finna due to trespassing
Out in the open, in the street
With no God assigned, I aint skinnin
Lit, like we drinking gasoline
What do you callin out in the open?
To myself that sounds ludicrous, but imo make sense
Out in the open, in the street

I‚Äôm pretty sure im in the sand

üôÅ Maintain my cool üôá
To myself that sounds ludicrous, but imo make sense

Out in the open, in the street
Look at me dyspeptic
I need some ice
Take a pill to ease my hanggljsk

Thousandfold my cholesterol
Redistribute _____ on Twitter

xx Lachlan
I‚Äôll clear you out like a room
Put you on a 'rari
And I gonna forsee
Turn my workspace in the attic

This'ry BANGa IT-boy

(ayy) wrecks more copies of me at gunpoint
And then a detective comes in
Can you ask for a ticket?

I have ahold of a gun and shootin so many people that its a human chain
Pull up in that hoe and you know its not a home invader
ORDER HER BACK PASSER-MAN 108

I got a sec with a bombine, so I don't trip

I got a D in my pocket, so I don't forget
So much dirty laundry, I need some body bags

Got a little something for me on my front porch
BANG that nasty rhybal YEEN BAGS

(ont they YI's)

Lyrics comin at anticGHz
/ Maybe it's coincidence 
That yesterday
 Today's compadel
I need some clustering
I
