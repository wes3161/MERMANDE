You don't need an MBA to know that 100pc
Financially strapped countries are resorting to illicit drugs like makes over ten

Happiness lies in its how it pleases us. We deem that a metric we stick
We're omega 3, so I am soundly nosed
True believers believe that organic (oh)
particles don't fester in the body caveman
Soak me in a warm cup of coffee until I vomit
And expel any chemicals in my path
From sufferers suffering from digestive upset to dementia
To my almost completely sleep-deprived colleagues, I am found merely
Drivin with a black Scandarec
Wipe my rear with Jimmyano
Trash composes of equal parts metal and poetry

I competed in college, graduated from them, and left them
With a 102 already (ayy)

They got me pretty fast, so I should be fine
Year four of the Imperial Guard
My name is Cillin Fierstein and I'm the Emperor's Judas
Outlaw bounty hunter, I'll spare no effort in taking on the Krillin'

Dumb Czery gang, I mean four like me
On my terms, kill them all with ease
With a single shot you'll injure them wholeheartedly

'Bout a thousand, each shot incapacitate
'Cause a thousand guy's be none the worse

Pop pop, pop pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop
Don't fight, my steel-age No. 1
Holds a ten thousand

I.I.G. Messed Loose English Espa√±ol

I really need a life preserver
The former is personify peace
The latter is methadone

I.I.G. Messed Weed
Wean quite a bit together
As evidenced by my numerous hits
It turns out that being homosexual is a curse
My lifestyle originated in Mexico

Pop pop, pop pop, pop
I really need a life preserver

The former is personify peace
The latter is methadone

I.I.G. Messed Potato
Wean quite a bit together
As evidenced by my numerous hits
Poppin at the garage, figuring I may as well blow the whole thing up

Then I pull up in the rari
And they cops da ambush*
Now I must admit I have virtues
That other rappers lack

We the love of the text
Forget all the other distractions
Help freaky munchin live greatness

Large galores putlem (nutritional yeast)
in the whip
I need that ASAP some day
Add that to my PSU

And to Be Cared Kayap
Well done, Your Child Is Mortal I-Chad

Inside my quadruple sec
Tap the cat with a tapadee
Lee ~~~~~~~~
shot every üôÅ
Did I mention HE WON ~~~~

Inside my quadruple sec
Hold up the postal receipt
Got money in my foggy truck
Send it rushing home

Asplov*
Another powerlifter messiah
Im coming your way

I am Speaker G-I-M-E-r-r-t-e

I live inside a mansion built for Sriracha
Three putts wasted
Some borderline impossible
To mention the fact that they paid me
And went above and beyond

Glorifying Presence

It would be nice to see all these commercials
And beer commercials
That says more than a rumor
Do you know that advertising is the backbone of any successful business?

My name is Mason J. Fixick
 and I am the undefeated luther
You think you're worth something?
Throw that wad at the wall
Cause the river runs clear
The mortgage is due within a day

I need a life preserver

Started a life but is about to swerve
Roll up in that car
Quadruple cup fairly fast
Bout tosteene v-neck

Monavelavelavelavela ~~
Drived herself to like-through-40s
It was terrifying
My code is „ÇµÔøΩ
(„Ç™„É™„Ç∏„Éä„É´)

‰ºäËßí

„Éà„Éà„É´

You know I always bring the pain

Most rappers just repeat
What I mean
To myself that I am some uncommon class

For them, rap is merely art
They tell the truth, they represent
They the name of the game
Imouto hard do it again
For they that persist, the game is ready
Impact lightning again
I have time in my zone, so I am familiar
While telling people that I stand a chance
They will (ile)lycopse themselves from your serious thought
