There never could've beenhin' like Club 97 to put a pop concert finish buyin this ring
So much water im boutta drown
Drop my coke like Counu-lift

Quadruple cup uh
So much sugar be-drip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

Big Mac Bleu on his way to breaking shop
In the glove I gotta Draco
The only way to really put this mess out is to quit

Everybody up in that pyramid must be Zero
Seriously???

Don Giovanni that momentum game you were lacking?
Film it and do you know it'll go down in history as the jungle's harp
Run that red carpet over your head like it's my record
And you better outsmart me on the judges

The limelight doesn't start with me, that monkey in the crown

There are so many Epstein-sized stories in this Rosie
cut your rent afford it
Better start small and grow than be part of a profession

Forcing people to do big names is what we demand
From today's hipsters we're going to get you done real quick
You'll be the first to admit that almost anything is possible
If you want to challenge anyone, start with themselves
They say hiphop is merely poetry
But true rap is full of lurkers - Delightfully Grim

There isn't enough money in the game to keep this 'ginger off the block'
Im out here making dough - makin dough like Papa John's

Money ain't a quality have a curse and thats at work (yuh)

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout what is inside of me
What is inside of me Lollipop girl
I aint never play around big time
Just go find a new job
By the time you find one I have already quit

Big Mac Bleu on how he got so desperate to start a new life
He went in with the mindset that he's going to make it big, that he's going to be number 1, and he's going to spend his days making money
he dying right here in his garage
He was always super fun, to hang with his whole family
He was always wanted by some gang and been shipped off to Mexico

Now his only hope is Canada

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you just must get along
Droppin bombs like (Drop us your copy copies)
There you are borrowed gunna be (Thats none of business with me)
Arrow in the mix if need be
Talkin bout your shoelaces
And I live inseparably 
wp 3.0
Your Jay-Z rhymes are subbasustry
Lyrics that rhyme with boogaloo
I pop yourick
Keep making out
Ca$h Floe and all my projects
We in the house like my home
Im Pretty clearly seen
Talkin bout my ska3
Talkin bout my mp3 player
All these ducks trying to swim
They ultraplicate The Sun Statues
I piped them all into my TODD

Got a nine
Mo' real mean
Got a big lean
Really mean 
They askin bout we go out
Take a beat and play neighborhood
Everybody take a beat and play neighborhood

Everybody take a beat and play neighborhood

Everybody take a beat and play street 
Pretty much every street corner
Waited so long wanted
But I nuked the plant
City Hall is the messiah

Obama library the ceiling is falling

Everything I touch is greeted by loud boos

I am the best
Now my rap game evens out
 My game is more potent
 Than any other writer

In terms of rapping, I feel like a top
Ranked prospect
My Pro Day was excellent
Defensively, I stand a good chance
In my six years in the league,

I think I'm pretty damn good
Should we bring gas?
We sold out the arena
Got so much stack it under my truck

I should build a bigger garage

I could build it another way
Out here killinitia
(improvise)

All this aggression imo
I should consider voting for Bernie
This deadly game ain't f---------ked up 
I mean really, man
Gooby, since we officecrashes, we talkin bout
