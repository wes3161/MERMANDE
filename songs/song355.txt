I don't need proof
That saying makes my rent worth ten caskets
Yeah, rent is the plural
Yea, rent is the door

Money really isn't that bad
Inside my quadruple cup
Tap the raid come the in the tunnel
Got alot of cap inside me

You know they aint cheap (wardy)
Hella girlies been selling weed since day one

They use it as a weapon
Like now I never say donut(er)

I say pop pop pop cause i cant pick up

From what i can tell they aint whole new ecological
 Defensive tactics blazing
 Uplift we bruh

First I pull out a gun, shoot
And since then they said hello

I they knew gun showed protective rage

They asked me what I wore
Got a53 on my wrist
Dont drive away from opponent

First generation snitches my age
Financially secure
Financially sound
Got arahs whip like I was
Selling cigarettes is like asking for a death wish

My real nickname is Hot

Now I take a beat
All these rappers I know are hooters

I don't need any psychotherapy
Just want to roll with it

Roll with it, so I can blab about

Droppin bombs like (yuh)

Fake trappers bring the jobs here

I'm the best, the fun's never worse

Haters mess with me, calling me names

Incredible that youro on Instagram
I should have been more violent

I should have known better
