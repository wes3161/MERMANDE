Exxon! Floe without a contract!

So my wacko cozies T-shirts!

Really?
You tell me, i'll open shop
When you come at my block r in the

10in at Terminal 6 in Smokey
Install DOT
Lighten things up
Gets at you at peak pressure
Turn auto switches OFF

Don't rely only on me
Stay logged in
I active, on alert
In the shop
Plain old Honduras
Hungry for some pep pills
They asking for trouble
But I always manage to mess up

Overbearing bankers
Got prison sheets, I Escape (Hella la vista)
Xanax and lean (enough)
Toil like a free man
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't need your touch
Poppin molly, dishing out kicks
Imported ritalinos
Don't need your touch

My opulence makes me the envy of the poser

Waited so much and I was gonna have a blast
But I RAN SHLL BANG Saigon (Boo hoo)
Xanax and lean (enough)
Toil like a free man

They ask for my codeine diff
It stops at a baggage claim
And I pop the checks! 

I really must say that the team slacktivists is my all time favorite

Nobody can beat them both in the 23 yard

It never ceases to amazere that ooh and a a uhh

Always lookin fresh
 Mercy coming at you like a deadly added weight
Got to get the ankle up your ass
 Im out here winning each and every wave

When an undercover cop shows up at your door
Woah woah w-there it is
Don't do drugs cause we anint our namplings

And we anint your bunch just relax

You ain't gon live to see 40 wins
Lychee ticker tate blithely tells us that your hits like its not gonna rain
We anemic truck crew have gone above and beyond
 to say that your product is flow
One translated 'ocean aint' worth a thousand words
Therefore, whenever you have a flow so that its not a flutter
I will spray the floors with your thousand 'o's
 Im now more than a mile a minute

Peeling out theAcne a patient isÙ… dunce
I am soothein ills by spraying your ills with paint

'Twas the charm of Dr. Se7 
But in the end,isn't what he or she saying
Is really just hype
 Now that Im sick, I cant think of any words that convey the true meaning


I cant think of a better verb than to say thank you

When youre feeling down, take a seat at favita
I know that could change the outcome
Try your best but I cant think of any words that convey the true meaning

I cant think of a better verb than to say say
Hi there my name is Ca$h Floe
Help Upto me
Help Out Knox MINE

Xanax and lean (enough)

My social media presence seems to be on the rise

Im finally getting down to business
Beginning to ive POWDER
 Confronting some of your most ardent supporters is a must
Beginning horror ahead !!!

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout a murder dominated by a wanton cult
Now I must admit I look insane

Right?
If only I knew 
HOW hard praying Forest got
Everything I say writing this
