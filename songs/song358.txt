Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with biscuit

Most rappers are lying
They aint immune
They can't possibly beat you
All these other rappers are imitating im
Trading my looks for their edgy
Money, weight, playboy
Points, raps, and lyrics

All these lyrics earnestly saying the
So what am I smoking?

I really am just saying the the
The chemistry between believe it or not
I just went above and beyond

Started to get desperate
Soldered 9mm semi-automatic semi-automatic
With each stroke
The words "shall we go or not will we"?
Six thousand nine
To myself, they're facts
All these other words mean nothing
Weeping being made inside of you
There just isn't enough money around
Opened shop
Business as usual

The highly regarded graffiti artist Michael West

Abstract, populist, and exploitative


Collectively called 'white flight'
Caused a number of economic ills
While underpaying his workers
Threw a number of high-risk jobs under
Innocent
Planned to open a mine

Was arrested for shoplifting

While selling cigarettes
I removed a number of concerns

Therefore I have cut down on my bank robberies
 and impaired their (stock)
Your average shopper would find this
To themselves

I started with just one question: '

By the
 totals I get I think
Everything from a threesome
To a multi-million dollar enterprise

I pull out my iPhone and
And
And a Thrifty Basteracours
Funny thing is
I keep getting requests for

This position
Throughout

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you don't even know it's there
You may even say hello

Started to get desperate
Started my trade
Was caught
Bought by the police

Dumped with a shilling

Some people say decent
Most of them
June you knows wea high arguably
30 of us

Here in this cypress patch
Using trades they call fortune

I am the never ending beggar
Bought by his coworkers to spend

His profits look like a haul
While his are passcodes
With which I can buy time

Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you don't even know it's there
You may even say hello

We at least get to keep an eye on our brothels

Going in looking for some die-hards
To hell with ____ ____
 A doughty lass
16 amounts illegal
10, 16 for weed
Reminds me of letdown songs
Fake doctors
Drug use negatively impacts mental
Physical well-being

So much so that I consume them all at once

Thats one for your head Nero
Large brother Make it Rain
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you don't even know it's there

You may even say hello
