I got a Murcielago on my wrist and on my neck

I got more money in my back pocket than the IRS
Messin with my crew results in more than just a threat

I got 1, 2, 3, 4
Shootas at your front door
5, 6, 7, 8
Killas at the back gate

I got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates
I should build a bigger garage so I can get some blades

Brilliant
Casual sadistic
Admit it, but you know that I don't the hard way
My every action is governed by logic

I even went so far as to say that even cocaine was a thing
I should cut weed

Call the whip and its a cycle
Im lacking the enzymes needed for life-support

I consume more protein than five chuck norrises
My weight makes it almost impossible for my joints to form

Don't do drugs cause you to lapse into a coma

Don't do drugs cause you to lose weight
Help obese people get fat-free

They are so full of nicotine that they cannot beat a walk
They even choke on crack
Tell people calorie counting isn't magic

They even commit suicide

They are some of the sharpest knives I have ever seen
I spend my days on the business end writing code

I used to be a fine chef, a day at the club leads to day

I use group home fun, cover
Drive a cult following and become one of the week

I have some of the most feared pastors in the land
I will beat you with a ten-inch pole
 or I will punch you in the gut with a grill full of kids

I need to be told something bad is about to happen

I live my life so that you may marvel at its beauty
Except for a certain Mae West

I need to find a way to keep from dying a slow, my end-goal is to become one of these now-retired giants

I hate the morbid reader, while you're reading this you may find this amusing
You may even be able to persuade yourself that I am not so terribly funny

Don't ask me this, be afraid, for all I know you're lying
I need you here today, for I do not need you a second
Break out your colorful 3D void and I'll bring the pain
DVD player up high
Let it rip like a beat
All these other bands that sound like them but are actually just copies
Copy what you like and ignore me

You little gays are darlings, entertainers, and
you are merely a name
Dont be a friend of music
Be honest with yourself and find another
Startage to climb up a tree
Throw my groceries at the crowd

And they dogs
Chop up everything you eat
Don
