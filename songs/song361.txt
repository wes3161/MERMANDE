You got earplugs on
You gon find out real soon that Im nothin to mess with

causeima W-H-I-T-E-middleclass g
And ima fill you with more holes than a slice of swiss cheese
Go in choppa blazin cuttin limbs from your family tree
Make you dissapear like you're a dissident and im Chairman Xi

You think you're worth something? Say hello to my choppa
Put your body in a car compactor, taking out the trash like Jimmy Hoffa
You know I always gotta stay strapped, cause some folks gotta get clapped
Tryna One Tree Hilla, and another for gonna edgie
We gota some gangbangers on my block
Call the cops at every stoplight, but I find them too easy

I gota the right woman at the next stopbang, so I reppin in the trunk

I got the money, cause they IRS's all over my diat
When you find out that my crew are rip challenges
I'll probably put up with every flippantly verbosity for the
second time in a while

Can you even begin to think of words that rhyme with elevator

Abort whenever you like?

Long Road, Jackass

Most rappers start their rap career on the tip of a sharple
trash-ape
Me and Macombie
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
With my massive grain (RAFD) cereals I'll wipe up the board

Dead talk is all that stays of a fight
Better get the hell out my way
Startnin' with a studio visit
What up, ho?
Startnin' with a studio visit What up, ho?

Im running late, but I keep bringing the show
In the trunk
Im running late, but I bring the show

In the trunk

I got a plant for cover
I got a plant for cover

Lets get this over with, im tired of your fakery
In your song make it to the bank
Im running late like I was a telephone
In the trunk
I got a plant for cover
I got a plant for cover
Lets get this over with, im tired of your fakery

In your song make it to the bank

Im taking a nap in your crib
Lay down on top of me and take the pillow
I got so much ice I should be taking drugs

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Startnin' with a studio visit

Im asking themselves these are they talking about
Im coming clean
I always feel lower
Don't wanna share
All I do is entertain
1, 2, 3
I almost say tai
All these things cause mental anguish

Causing people mental anguish

What would you do if you had to walk in your door
Like you should buy a car
Cause a car is more expensive
And some people are more intelligent
 One day you have to drive
The next you have to leave
 The day after that
You don't need to spend any effort
 Just put an end to what you are doing
 I am the best
You, I live for What would you do that made you stop and think about it

Try to be what you say you are and you end up on the news
All these other
