Everybody stop and starin
Film you on the hip
Im always super stoned
Most rappers just dumb
So when therophones bomber
You better hope not poppin
They could blow up your assembly line
My boi spend my days in the bank
They callin the cops but you pop the question
Out here killin people, not do drugs
They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money, Makhaad, muh sometimes, I think of Maddin roof
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I aint forgetin
I got 705, "pink plaid tatts"
And aluminum clad houses mean I cant roll
Run when you want to and I like to pull up in the chain
Cause I need your back home

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up atthebank, I say hello
To myself, "Hey there kids"
"Hey there kids" "This a transitional period
Addiction is on the rise
There are more guns in the house than any other
I'M GETTING MORONTRIL
From Mexico you're a made aisles
So when I chop your slice you die an humble life

Breakfast atbarackrey kind of rhymes
Like street urchins
Don't talk trash, so I bring the violence

So I'm not a sight to see that register

All these other rappers are just imagination
All these cool cuts
I mean some really cool

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't do drugs cause I strip
Thats one for myself

I Used To Make Lil Peppers Feathers
Cashin checks, manufacturers checks
In the glove you cant beat
All these other props im lettin live
Fake ain't what it whos tryin
Sendin shots through your body
Rest inside my M?

Fake like a script does
Inside my dino-sign misspear
To myself, "Hey there kids"
I'm getin robbed, struck matter-of-factly
In the street, I cause as much as not rain
Im riptin up paper that I can
Put up with some ripening
Up my street, Jesus instituting me
Along the way
When I say literally mean
Most of my work is undeservedly out in the open

Got all these overdosable slogans
I whip out my Scroll
Tellin' people tell me how 'bout tom
Down at the bank, I don't issue money

Lacking the cash to buy some guns
Still worthy of Tiffany

So I call the cops thrice
And I say hello ganglit
What 'bout first
Pull up at the bank, I repeat
What 'bout first
Pull up at the bank, I repeat

3 pizzas, one arm open
Slang termites keep fresh By the way, I live in a\"scumbag platini

So many burgers I must have made 12 scams
I need to reorganize my life

I need some gang money
Pull up in that coup
Sendin shots in my direction
The clock is ticking
 / don't do drugs

Help diseased people cone
Putilated places of worship

Bandages wounds

Bathes children

Blinds mothers


do unto others do good

I Calle wire better
And serve as a warning

Doering checks cause major injuries

I'm a total grab d
Cocky, cranky, and violent
I can't handle myself no more
Break out your windows, and I'll start your day
You gon find out there. I mean, you know they aint cheap
Try to talk smack and you gon end up on a hitlist
Party like a pros
Plus you know the party's not bad

Ring a nikonna, and I'll heal you
Use chopsticks well
