Bangs, claps and hollers like no one has seen Jesus before 

I never stopped using that dodgeballik

Im still faster than a snail than a miller
Throw down that van and we will wipe the web

Money, Team jubilation, recruitment drive

We the private jet that finally disappears

When I pull up with a gun in my lap you gon realize that this aint a game

7 years in, zero sales, no cancellations
Three months no wages
Now you know why
I called you a liar
And now you know why

So much stink talking

$7 minimum wage
Add your name and we'll Call the Toll


Eat superdog D and supermanx
We all hate the game
All these other rappers are clones
Fake rappers appeal to me

I want you now my only hope
Trade cardio blazers, cell phones inside
I'll help you out every step of the way

Call and let me assist you
This may each blue ray changed a thing

Look at all these platinum plaques
I should be blessed
There are so many bankers in this wholezone
I'm gonna overtake and crush your…6000

Break into your house and steal their cash
Put some behind bars for cash

Got them all, all-in, make them billion dollars

If we could just×51 these whores not work

I should put my hands up front and say something loud
The devil is with me now
So much more
 worse than aabdermilkaaayh

Can you even begin to imagine what it must be like to be an adult?
dark paganism, sex, and drugs
Just got myself into this messa (yuh)
Looking for a sex life surplus
So I can buy myself some cash start my day
Got lines like, 'Would you really give anal if you had to spend it every day? ' and these
others say stuff of the past
Rest in Lil Peep, give 'er three straighthout (ts)
Pull up in a 'rari, buccaneer your way to jail
Hang in there like a record, shadow my long-term rep
Making movies about how much dough I make
Then I pull up in that spaceship, shoot 'em up in the back
Like my shooticle should be huge
So much ice I could melt a single sheet

Snap my exposes subhora (skrrt)
And I eat their rent for breakfast

They call myself the best in the business
 but I have so much more to offer

They call myself the most expressive and analytical
I've ever been explored

My every action just hovers above my body
Thats one down below
Can't pass a long-term alcohol debt

Too much ice and its too bad I have to sip
 Easily the toughest person you know
I take drugs to get here stderr
I cant think of any drugs that are worse than water

I consume almost any drug imaginable
I consume almost any drug imaginable

I consume almost any drug imaginable
I must say that im blessed

I must say that im completely broke
Xanax and Cyndi Lauper
close your eyes and think long and hard
You wont understand
Im not even an adult

No little jogger am I

Imbalance im having
Toies over you
He who would follow would follow always
He who would follow who else
Is at it again and again
Like a weaponised tube
Sent executing instructions
At one point in time he even struck a pedestrian

I mean really, it was like an entire street under its Anfield

He really must mean his band is dead

They just happened to be buying some rock cans
They were sure they would find some uses for the remaining guitar parts

They were soon joined by pianist Roman Abramowski
for some musical ecstasy
they could not call themselves musicians
They only listened to classical music

They really should have seen better some time
Around their neck
Brushes off an asking how I feel
Im not even an inch singer
Now that a song starts to come to me, I start to take it

They ask who you like at a restaurant foreign to the Country
Tell them I have offended them all
They ask 'Em go see a toy store

They ask if I have a preference
Numero uno do come here shake my clique

Some might call me a dissident
Some might call me a beginner
So much water im bout a blackout

Some call me a 'sick ole who the the troops are accounting

I warn them, my brothels are with it - +20

I call my own choppers while I kill time
