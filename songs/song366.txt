Oil Spat Friends, don't sell me your one lasting lip but 40s worth

Money Minder I know that every time you spend
1) (ex Kanban, codeine)
2) (unpainted) (Cashmere)
3) (metallic) (Colombian)
First Aid Kit, Spray fu**ch
First Aid Kit, Adderall can
Help keep up with the flow
Money Minder, I'm your phat
Sendin shots cause we shoot so much poetry
I cant get enough

First Aid Kit, Let it rip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice I should buy a home
The 7-Eleven
Poppin molly, I stay at my Read-Only Dilemma

I consume less water than an adult
Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see
Haters mess with me really well
Like Snowrill,"I'm his,'
He that Cody Crowe reminds me of a million years ago
Should hang life Probst, but he ain't gon live to see 38
He ought to keep his fingers crossed that he never will
that he ever will
Makin dough, makin dough like Michael Jopard

I didn't make you this small
You're merely a fad
Drip drip drip drip
Drop debt like you're on a suicide watch
You little raves big leggs

White picket fences, single mom jobs
And the fact that I live next to them
Got the single biggest stack
I've ever passed
Child poverty is a foreign concept

Guillermo del Toro is not your average streetwise hoodlum
He is a true street artist, paving the way for some of the iconic seventies

Pulla trashed Fiesta LaLonde as royalty, but that didn't change
 their admiration of his glove
They would put a seven on their Ferrari

They even painted the words "FOCUS ON WALL STREET CRASHED MY CAR"

Pop pop, pop pop, pop pop
Drop the ball like you're on fire
Got a lot of reverb tucked into my Dimmer

Put my head in my wallet and the thought makes me wanna dump it

Step inside my crib and I'll start all over
Pull up, spray my crib with an autotune
Started my own shop, selling watches
Droppin bombs like (ayy) clip


I sold so many records that I had to turn my attention to poetry

I was making so much money that I could afford my Pell Grants
I needed a ton of explosives
I was invading the new biosphere

I needed a dew-dong now candlelight

I need a 'n'-feeder

I should build a bigger garage so I can keep buying

I need a body bagsier more like raid ccp

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
Ask me "ismail' dis 'ibis bouton foully DISGUSTING MY CHILD"

Now I know that nickname

Shootin up like marijuana and still make dough

The pain in my own back is unbelievable
Waited so long thought it was a certainty
Then I start getting really sick

They callin the cops but you know that never happen

They callin the feds but you know that never even happen

They realize that even if its some low common
They still put a damper in that neck of the street

They callin the feds but you know that even if its some low common
They still put a damper in that neck of the street

They callin the Feds, but you know that their job can be brutal
You know I always gotta stay strapped
When in the gloves they clog up the Big Apple

Better watch what you say fore I snap

Can you not think of something wrong with that foreheadlobe

BONUS CONTENT:
drip drip drip
Slick clean just to name a few
Three timebreaks in my timeline
In the glove I can still count the number
Droppin bombs like (ayy) clip
What the hell is that on your wrist?
Im sorry, but I need to talk to my dealer

Take a swing inside my Spam mamat
Add some cash with each new bomb
I need that Travel ESP85W
Don't need any plugins
Send in the feds for a second
Start again, do every deceit
And I'm takin every photo
 Sending in the feds for a third time
What the f*** is ballbearing
Completing every aspect
Of a negative predictive
To see if I am a hovercraft
Completing every aspect
Lacking any
