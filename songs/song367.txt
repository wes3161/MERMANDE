AI champ!
The Keto Chow
With each pull, I stay leaner
Like my gills stay fresh longer


I consume more fat (no cholesterol)

Large Cash Lanes Kill Uptowners!

Plus, you know, you lot I bring the heat

All these other Benzies I gonna take home
Just to prove to the cops that I'm not a snob

Well, at least I'm doing my jobs properly

I should be able to find enough body bags (zinc, yttrium)
To carry around with me when I need to

'Cause I'm the number one (you need to ask taxidermist)

Lyrics comin at you at this clip
Lipity loppity
limpy vertebral line
hillbilly with a poise
I think I speak for myself
Lyrics ____a rip gettin' metal like Mahatma

I should have bought some more at a jeweler
When not ready to mail
Send me some junk like Ronin T-shirts

Lyrics Í≤†s Mellow (uh)
Hungry for some dopamine
To spice things up
I should have bought some more
Sentenced me to seven years in prison

To quell any dissenting ideologies
I'll never go back
308's My No. 1 gem
(Thats booming in my ears)
Got buttons flashin (yuh)
Like a different day
Plump is gypsing is out
Like my Crohn's is a disease
Wheels quacking are coming from under my tongue
Thats it shot for your head
Try to argue with me
But my deafening rap
Pull ya like a tube of chapstick

Got a rent for your head (skkrt)
Don't need your real price
Suppliode need a rescue
Got body bags full
Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got a gated community my and em all home
Gucci boots here, repeat my business
Drop dead unrecognizably
My drum kit plays bigger than a clap (chuh)
My weed makes you wanna vomit (de)
Always rise above it cause I take my hat off (So) late
Always hungry(uh) and restless (Why the FUNT report you a hate crime)
Be careful what you wish for(uh)

My security deposit is your all-important receipt
So much money you almost slip
Not my stuff, not even close
Money freezes at my bank ‚Ä¶ [exhale/move along]

Started to get desperate
Robbed that 7 time findin
Told the white boy my age
Got my bronzrix
Made red, gold, and platinum
Was buried with a bunch of cash
That I whole gang can beat
Turnips and Bradley Wiggins are my neighbors

They retire me from this ice cream
So when you find me craving something more than a dollhouse ...

I build my own
