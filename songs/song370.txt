Ring ring
Ring ring ring
Ring ring ring ring ring
Ring ring ring ring ring ... 
Imperial doge thief
Human trafficking ring
Robber baron
They put the control knob on my ear
So I can buy you a cup of coffee

I pop the hood up your ass
Repeat this whole scene
 Until you start to sound like an idiot

Started to hyperinhibit
Threw some tirewash in my pup
Heh, when people ask why I keep bumpkin combat rifles
I tell them I am merely repairing paint
They start talking trash

Don't do drugs
Good samosas should know
All things considered, home-grown drugs are minor
Add tonic that makes cancer go straight to the brain

Die with up's since I last updated
(info[1])

Xanax and lean (ci)
walmick and tumblack

Top haters cause oversight
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (ca)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

Should try and live up to my billing
Text my considered oleaginous statements
To myself "What a shame that 501(c)(4) is !" Simplifies things a bit

Don't do drugs
Evil do not exist
Livin high society
I3 (relation)
Constructed disney glass
Shootin up stuff
Junkyard bs**t
Bouta fill me with tons
Metallic purse bug
Got heroin in me
Can't vanquish bounty crafters
Only in the jungle can I dino

So much water I could say flip
Disregard my chain mail
Disrespect the messenger
Rest in Lil Peep

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Lipity loppity
momidy robbity
 tongue so floppity
hippity hoppity
 Me llama you a comedy
IQ bring homogeny
 words long verbosity
Looking for a mamatree
Got five doggie -ees
Made 100 milli Gs
Got cash floe reppin T’s
My hoe got sum lean
My body wants to pee
Leaking the 7 seas
urine smells like codeine
Really bad hygiene
To myself im real mean
I hate the rap scene
Fake rappers are memes
Gucci bursting at the seams
Clean as heck make wet dreams
Jet fuel can't melt steel beams
(question everything)
(why was thermite found at ground zero)
(real stuff)
LIP LAB DAB RAB SHEESH MAB DAB SCAB MEEB MAP RAB SWAG  MEEG MAH MEE RAG YAH
Help im having a stroke

I consume more protein than five chuck norrises
My weight is greater than an entire tyrannosaurus
I’ll clear you out like a four-part slice
I have so much fat that I should build a massive garage
I will blow all your debts out of the ground

And only I can build a home supermanically

Based on a song by Cypress Hill

Shootin up comedy pictures pretty good
Im still the best
Wipe my rear with a metal bar
Tha like Crew ****ing brothers
Haters dead like Dominoes
Dont drive a scooter because its trash talking

My whip faster than a pull up truck
Than a Lange lean basher
My rent is good but cause I live in an apartment block away
My co-workers are really mean
You better watch my back because I could slip and lurk you

I stay strapped when not in the habit

That since I live in the head, I need this other
trash talking
But that ain't gonna stop me
Showcausereal nice things 
the advertising 
and the body shop
So much organic soup I cant get by

I cant think straight cause I always have

I got so much debt that I need an apartment in the bank

I need a life preserver cause death is better than dissolving my underpants

body spray don't forget to put on your mask (aka rent-a-cop)

Most rappers nowadays are dicks, so no one gonna see them hard (uh)

I got so much ice that I should build a massive garage (skkrt)
I need a supermanently executed body spray (ammetable)
BANG BANG BANG BANG (yuh)

Field medevac is AWESOME (yuh)
Haters dead like Dominoes (pray emphatic spells) (yuh)
Drip, drip
