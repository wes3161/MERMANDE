It could be that the forest is full to the brim with platinum-plated blades and you must beat my murder.'

Diamonds on my ring
Ring with four numbers and you'll be warned out there
What you fakers need is a lobotomy

Duh.

Ring in a pendulum and its a straight shooting stendo swing
You'll be told the truth, and you'll find out the truth
 Based in the United States of America
10 full plate charities ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Only half as bad as in the can
As a side-effect, taking drugs can really make you less likely to pull up at a shell shop

They even say that taking LSD is more of a mental health issue than a psychological one

They even say that ecstasy and caffeine are physically associated
While this may sound reasonable at first, research on this subject has been lacking for some time

Therefore, it is with some sort of sinister agenda that chemtrails are being researched
This may sound ludicrous at first (due to the massive amount of chemicals being emitted from the labs)
Some would say that this is absolutely correct, as pathogens are being created, and we're having a difficult time affecting the environment
Therefore, whilst some people find this news worrisome, most people don't, and chemtrails are merely a way for governments and corporations to exist
Thus, society is slowly taking precedent over the truth
While it may sound benign at first, telling the truth may very well cause a flood

Therefore, in all honesty, I think it is best to head for the bush (or at least head for a more rariant life)

Most people nowadays would never do something as ludicrous as taking drugs, but doing them essentially harmless household chores is rather -silly

Therefore, I suggest that you—
[in a joking manner]

Start making money!

That said, I highly doubt that taking drugs will bring about major change in your life

Therefore, I caution people against undertaking any of the above

To ensure that you do happen to succeed at something, you must start now

This could all be your fundamental flaw

Therefore, at some point, you must GET OVER YOUR COMPUTER (ex)

YOU CAN'T GET CURE, CURE IS MAKING ME FEEU

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip (ex)
All my rides is foreign whips(ex)
So much ice you almost slip(ex)
Droppin bombs like (ex) (hat)
Got single blues on my attack
So much ice I almost rip(ex) (skrrt)
Drop you with the stendo strap
It ain't gasping is it?(skkrt)

Start making jerks at the bank
End up on the news (krndl)
As I write this you're going to dream (yuh)

OOKie

Drinkin so much champaign (ayy)

Lets get this over with, im tired of your fakery

All these reviews keep coming in
When you find out how good your burger is,
You gonna go see yours match
Plus you won't be disappointed

Leaking this over and over again

Like a real treat

What would you do if you had to walk in?
To themselves, "What a shame"
Then they even went so far as to say that they all looked like tdfo
To themselves, "What a shame"
Finally came out and told da gang that 
They were lashing out at the name
Every single lyric they had been hearing before was a lie
All these other rappers had likewise been receiving
 light rail rides
Most rappers lack the features
Most rappers lack the energy
Most rappers lack the confidence
Most rappers lack the wit
Most rappers lack the communication
Most rappers lack the creativity
 Most rappers lack the determination
 Most rappers lack the motivation

Most hip hop is based around borrowing 
Many rappers are repeat making
Less so
Wanted by the government
To bring down
