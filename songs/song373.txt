Autumn Leaves a Kiss on Your Face
When I was six, a white teen named Mia (Wanda Sy) and I went to college in the Midwest. We went to eat at a local chain. We went to end up drinking on the street.
Only, four summers later, I came home to find three committed murders, one of which was on my brother's watch. The next day, my gang-raped, beat-up, drugs-soaked homie brother watched all my trash talk. Then he went to pick out some clothes for us to spend the next day together.
I want you to know that pieceofshit killer Mia wanted me to kill
And death, while yam protein, made my blockies so lean that I almost died the day I put this in my dash
