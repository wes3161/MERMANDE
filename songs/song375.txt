Lyrics are first-class lives;
Everything that isn't pop is trash
Lacking creativity, they work really, really well
So much so that some even call jobseekers "superlatives"

They even say that Elon Musk is the beginning of technology

Lyrics is the future, we the beginning of the end
Funny thing is that some artists, before they even think about what they're saying,
They actually take their songwriter(?)s time and put it here
So a song can really get a fake start

They also say that Mona Lisa is the ringgit(?), but that ain't gonna change
They name their products after a certain person
They even call them graham
What are they callin me
