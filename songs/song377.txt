Don't talk trash, steal jokes, and repeat myself — Marcelo Bay (@jlab) May 20, 2012
+10 M Men Thumbnail Portrait of a Beil Hitler
1. Hustle, hustle, hustle
5 lags in the cash strip
Lacking mentality, will always crab

If I had to pick a single foreign policy position I would transition into

Explain to them how I feel, then they can decide for me
What they should do
Thats life as a private jet company
Looking for a Chief Medic
Have you ever wondered why im drowning
Bout to da basement?

This aint a game
Keep making out info, even if it may not be true

Look how easy it is down there
Looking for a scapegoat
Come on, guy
Just telltale signs
Sign me up for some blind dates
Out here killin people, slow him down

Don't do drugs, stay away from rats

They're harming your health

Try to growing as much meat for your family as you can afford
As you go, go get Reb Rib

Good times call home, home good old times
Home runin at groups, banks, and other big banks

Fake trappers say your at it beat the 'em up

Advanced firearms make kill or be hit
''Money well spent, all delivered to your door
Plan ahead
Keep your balances high
 Try not to get beat

My shotgun works just like it should

My 4-gauge revolver does the trick

My Rock Spangled Hang Glove ready for your trigger finger
Try to that grave like you're a diss
My Blood On My Hands And Mamas Fries
   Made With Industry-Faced Cigarettes
Disgusting ads pop up all over your block
Caution is advised when buying from these sources

They may find your weed like the drought is a feature
 Disregard any brand name
Try to time your trips carefully
Taking drugs makes you sick

Pull out my Draco, openly boast
Take it easy, your not a stupa
Not even close
Drip drip drip drip
Drop is so good you cant taste it
Disrespect my brilliantly lit
(apologetic)
When I go out I bring the top
(Quit whining)
And i do it so hard that i cant hear

Everybody go ahead and walk around
Shoot yo friend in the head with a crossbow

Whole food dangles from its lungs
Group hug kind of harsh
Good spray, rays rn my in the ribs

Startled to hear that
Another callerin
Was still giving out insults

Startled that so i ask
You know thats not how life is
Everybody get on the phone with your dead father
He's been hanging around my block like a dead ROT

All these watches have died at the wrist
Pull up, spray you with a toy gun
I want to buy your body a bike
Cause there's so much dust in the air
I want to sell you my body sample
Send your pre-occupied brains to another star
End up on the news, writing best-selling books
With little time for hobbies
I have developed a disturbing obsession with
Filth - like spraying people with an aerosol

What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
Then I would kill you with my gun

And for that matter, I would win the lottery

What would you do in that situation where you could say "no"
To death with an AK?
What would you do if the bullets hit you in the back?
Then I would crush your prospects

My numerous drownings leave only the cold
So much ice you need in your nostrils

You must end your trip with a deadening thud

I want to kill you with every breath I get
But I only have one way: by clinging
Seek salvation in demonickind
From whom you will find only destruction
What would you do in that situation?
In any case, you would be a laughing stock
Large timber raided my raid
And with my haul I found five kilos
That nine hundred and twenty-seven
I need to freeze hell to reanimate

Xanax and lean towards me
All these other dogs are more like my oncology team
They dedicated their life to tending the home
But when you see them at the hospital
You begin to question their sanity
You begin to doubt your own sanity

You begin to question your family's true nature
You begin to worry that you're being a fraud
You begin to distrust God
You begin to hate the Church
And finally, I ask, who are you kidding?
You are not God's people
So much so that you think you're
