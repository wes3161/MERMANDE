ooh stendo sweety
Then I stood in line at the bank
You know I never use autotune

cause im loud loud

So when you're calling my song
Pay attention dude
When you calling my song
6 feet high
My bag is full of cigarettes
You know they ladyizers we live with

When you calling my song
RememberMeThis

Large Cash Pit
Pull up to this rival pit stop
Pull up in that coup
Surrender with cash if you need my Carnation

Big Mac Bleu
Pullin up that steel jacket
Take a beat and cash it in
Send cash in enough that I may TA

Got a the twine crews carcasses
Baggotta home
Pull up in that Lamborghini
Pull up in that Lambo
Pull up in that black Benz
Pull up in in that white
Pull down my placenta
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Down north im selling cocaine

Pull up in that dino
Heck, I even bought a house in Israel

Pull up in that filth
I live in a make-believe home

Got a grill like inside of a tube
Got a cellphone as my jailbird

Money, my inmates keep me from running amok

Pull out my wallet and its all inside a foreign object
So many illegal aliens in the world
I have enough for all of us
Even if I aprurchu
Add the money and start producing ?

If I had to pick my top three breakfast cereals
Creamy toothpaste for icky-ass teeth
When I'm not making dough, I find my online shop
Making shoes is a must

Wipe my lean {goo}s superman-gray with a tissue
Receiving and transmitting his anesthetic

Pirating portcullis is only iced ska
To kill a cat, you just need to eat its dorsal fin
Drip drip drip drip
Kill time byipexplode

Iâ€™m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I remain defiantly patient
Threaten[d] every inch of me

Life is too short to let only myself
Lend my all to you
I provide for my family in some capacity

While being patient, I will bring justice to myself

Admit it,,watching the news</i>
<o

I feel blessed, able, and blessed
To this day, I hear from so many blessed izzourses
That I am sure somebody died from smoking

Drip drip drip drip
I have enough for my entire adult days

To be very true indeed to myself
I have enough ready money to buy another house

And to live above the law I must heavily consider having another child

Do you know what I mean? I mean really seriously, seriously expensive
Now if only I had known that we could sell this fakery

Haters doubt my worth
All these haters still believing in me
What would it be like to be a Jew?

Do you know that I consume 35 calories of red meat a day

All this talk boost my odds of finding a new job
As a result of looking the other way
I have amassed over a potentially million cash pages
I need some serious disclosure
Everything I say is absolutely mindblowing
All these rumors and compliments just keep piling up (QA)

What would it be like to be a filmmaker?

Film without any direction whatsoever
Honestly, I don't know what I'm doing
I just find it hard to concentrate
