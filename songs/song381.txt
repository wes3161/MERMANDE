I put some mask on and now I am a billionaire

Pop pop pop I'm the Bus

Quadruple uppers we go buy something new
Plus I keep score
 on the news

Keep on forcing myself

This way nothing bad will happen

Can you even begin to imagine what an insane world an illegal trade really is

I mean really, really think we am
Entertain ass children, weldonians, veins, chins
They even took my wife to the cleaners
