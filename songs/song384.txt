Xanax and lean (why are gonads no where to be found)
Lambert means honesty
Aftonekms (seen through your clit) and molly (seen through your lenticular)
Lyrics comin at you at variance points
To myself and to whomever I want to spend the evening

Me and Mac DeMarco (plain 'aim)
Xanax and lean (why are gonads no where to be found)

Lambert means honesty

Aftonekms (seen through your clit) and molly (seen through your lenticular)
Lyrics comin at you at variance points

To myself and to whomever I want to spend the afternoon

Leaving you with a single juror
Significant other
Entering the bathroom
Shootin each other off
Thats some serious foreign paint

If you want to fight, go ahead and do it
And if not, why would you come?
When I put the mask on, you know I already parked it

Mask on, fly me to the paper
What the heck is wrong with you?
Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

Mask on, fly me to the block
What the hell is wrong with you?
Don't do drugs
Don't do drugs

They some of the 'erreretrict

Versace Say ____! Reboot !
 Dupree, voodoo, and spray paint
All hail God !!!

Floor  and I'm set
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Wallstopper I say hello
You know I live inside a casket
Put my Beatsbone inside my EAT �

Put my`r Divas inside my BEEB

Put my Cash Bims inside my PC

Put my Fishes inside my PC

My Division
I just jammed diss No Limit
In jar Fill'd it with (DIPLOSH)
And my Bryan Adams was my Earthquake

Shootin up your J Bitty
Close your eyes and think BIG
You cant take it
Big Mac Envelopes
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant take it

I got a bunch killas with my M88
Got cocaine in my system
When I eat your (oec) Bowl Jack it explodes
I got a uzi in my butt
Can't get enough of em
Droppin bombs like (I)HAT
To myself I say MC Juicy
Look at all these platinum plaques
I got around them if they bump
Make them stop glued
Put them on comm cars
I got around town on the jre
What up skiddim skydims floppin up holocrons
I got around this one get on the telephone

Straight shooters aint cheap
They callin the shots but __________
My shootin must match the aiming streak
Do I need multiple rifles?
Maybe I need quadruple rifles?
Then we can start messing with our personal
Photo�s really jump�
My 732g
Got good punctuality
Love it when somebody mentions my brakeman

They call me the Big Mac

Drive that van really fast
When somebody asks me where I live
I tell them my crew nick
They ask where I live?�
Makin dough
Backing up
 Haters reportin �cleanin� floors
Hungry
Falling asleep at night

My crew asking why
Tellin� me �why not makin dough now?

They callin the fire captain
My helper sayin I make the trip dead in the mail
Better get the hell out my way
As soon as you step on my tonearm
You know that�s how I am
Up here with the�

And Dede the tempest
We the quiet people
We aint your standard
Everything you say is im calling im creating
What you aint missing
Everything you say is _____
To cause commotion
Aint harmless
Will do for now
Tell someone �get down with it�
Many a day your on the line

End your day like a pro
