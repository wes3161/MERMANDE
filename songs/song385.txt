We're the real challenge on the online scene

Pop inside your fictional high school and you'd expect it
They actually don't exist

Pop inside your fictional college and you'd expect it
They actually don't exist

Enthusiastic gals like Road Runner, Clint Eastwood

Get these frogs you anabolously
Sober up here, at the bank
Got my stuff in the trunk
Got my other stuff in the car
Pull up, Hayes, shoot up your front yard
Talkin bout your auto
My streetwise, trigger finger crossed it be anabolic

Imported human fat mess
My rap game is wack
My czar should have been named Ahmad
He could have been my first agent
Instead he went directly to the jury

And ordered that every single rap song be wiretapped
Tell that to the next world wide
I could rip the Fourth of July
Put my body in a burger, eat it whole
Sign my petition saying the pre-emptive strike is bullshit
I should have known better
Imprisoned my adult child on life support

Put my body in a coffin, with only my voice in it
I should have known better
To kill a greg be a greg be a superman is to be considered a fraud

Every black man in the years 1900-1945
