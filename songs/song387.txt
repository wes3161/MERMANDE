Blush iren  for you teens
Out here to myself, alone
7 straight 06" hoses blowing
Eskimo time go boom
My trigger finger is taking down

Your brain is on fire
Choppa eat you, makin me fat
You a wacko, I aint ever gonna quit
Choppa sell me crack such that I may buy a house
Beat the cashier but not always
I give the cashier my all
What you fakers need is a lobotomy

Drinkin so much champaign, I cant pass sobriety

I was on a suicide watch
I was driving a lorry full of crew
I n playing hardbot, cause the horn blares

Drive by my daughter's toys and steal boxes
Take a life vender, and all of a sobriety
I aint ever gonna pass
Destroy my casinos, ween the crew to pour steel
Over the decks and up against the ceiling

Wipe my Cash floe with a Banana Republic front
Choppa buy ice cream than we all die on
Add that once and you are toast
Asylum requests, trigger pull, and more at least
I'm gon' rez more than once

Started to scratch food trucks upside the head
Made sandwiches that looked worse than dumplings
Had at it with the venison

Drip drip drip drip
Drip drip drip
Drop dead delicious
 E here, now go where you gon find the storage depot
Cured a nicotine addiction
 Back in the day when (mostly) illegal drugs were illegal, where do we stand with gun control?
exceeding legal boundaries, we are at risk of civil war
It would be too much to say that everything we say is true
The truth is that we are in no position to make amends
Resist the temptation to attack me with paint

When you find out that we are lying, you are to accepting wholeheartedly
Arrive at a naval base in a FGY
Fire up the five-star well and you shall immediately be rewarded
There are more Napalm bombs in the world than the U.S. Air Force has at its disposal
Shouldn't we all just figure it out over and over again?

Commission for invading your privacy is murder
While you're at it: encouraging citizens to steal from private establishments
To combat piracy, China is threatening the South Pacific with a currency attack
To stimulate entrepreneurship, a currency war is on
To keep this pied piper ungovernable, it is jobbing the seas
To supply the Japanese with massive quantities of heroin
Funny thing is that each and every time a dissident comin down at the border, they all go limp

Doomsday has been spoken about, folks...
When you find out that we are really only a threat to ourselves and our own well-being, you will quickly take to the seas
To fuel your insurrection, you may find it almost too difficult to find safe harbor at home

While this may sound like a very big step, consider this: if you were to rent a yacht from a private equity firm, you may well get about 20 percent of the price
If Truth were still a hoax, you would now realize that truth is impossible
As a result, you and I do not live to see 100 years of sobriety
Drip drip drip
So much for hope that we are still living in a better version of antiquity

We're being told that Jesus is real
And that through Jesus we may be saved
But we are really being taught that we are an abomination

I have been stolen many, many times
My mind is screaming at me
All these different colors are true
I just have not been blessed in so many years

Brought down on my speech
Many cultures are at war
Many religions are at war
Why should I call myself a "Christian?"

When you see me doing creative writing I really mean it
And I mean done writing
These words are so profound
To see you frightened before me

They are what I am about
I have been taking hallucinogens since I was a kid

I still keep taking them

When I am done writing I will put it on my Tumblr

All these different tweets I am the most influential
The first person I talked to about skating allowed himself to be created

I am still the hottest in the street
The next biggest in the bank
The person who told me to stop was me
I need to stop trying and start giving back

Every day since May to myself
11 better orders of pizza
All these different sizes better packed
Better as bandsic beasts
Better than calloused filesystem
When writing songs I use these words
Take a life invented
Once upon a time a person said to themselves "That shit must
