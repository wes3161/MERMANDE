So today I made some money making sex toys
I bought some ice skates
Got some spare guns
Got like castle come with it
Really big storage compartments
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz
Then I pull up in the rari
With my shooters you'll be sorry

My armory, expansive
My catapult aint passive
Tha barret is be massive
My draco is jurassic

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Lipity loppity
momidy robbity
 tongue so floppity
hippity hoppity
 Me llama you a comedy
IQ bring homogeny
 words long verbosity
Looking for a mamatree
Got five doggie -ees
Made 100 milli Gs
Got cash floe reppin T’s
My hoe got sum lean
My body wants to pee
Leaking the 7 seas
urine smells like codeine
Really bad hygiene
To myself im real mean
I hate the rap scene
but still my real love is Instagram

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Bust a gigolo like he were a toy
Bust a quitter like he was a child
Bust a makin a cause with my site
In the jungle they call
the open carry
They call
air ranged
 ammo
Really bad hygiene

To myself im real mean

Slap a cup at you on the street
You aint your(ens)ight
You urd lookin
YOU (urine) urd lookin
Another cup of coffee could really mess you
I need a body suit
For the crew and the cancer
Yeah I need a life preserver

For God and Man
So much water im drowning

Im like a sandwich without the tails

I need a body suit (bulletproof)
For the crew and the disabled
Messic thou with 'em like my backs made
I'm not challenging
