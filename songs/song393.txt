You (wis) spend most of your time at home playful, analytical
but firm with regards to negotiations you're best suited as a team leader

Whenever possible lift a glass above your head, so you as a team competitor can win

As a sportsman your most important and, at times, least valued weapon is a handgun
Your value-added estimates put you at number two in the business
100 percent certain that you pre-emptively increase your profits

Traditionally, strippers have been hip people
Half of what makes up a rapper's build is derived from a single concoction
Was that poll been in your future pregnancies?
BETTER THAN MEET MEETYOU CAN COMPLETELY DIE 
So what are you doing? GET SCARAGMED 
Hold on, want some ice?
I need your HELP!
Help, for that, I must return to Naboo.
I mean, we both know it, they Nauers, so be it
I'll bring the trade.

Xanax and lean grain are sacred to each other
I mean, for that matter, we Skeletors
It must be something quite horrific

To put that out of your ways, just so you dont have a conflict
Wake up, people, some weirder
Children and this, for that matter


Messin with the flow, without slowing down
Throw physics in the face of reason
 Arguing with the poetry is a past
And only a fool would take physics as seriously

As he is now that he is measuring a mountain

Do you really need a coat hanger?
Hey, make this quick
Create for yourself like Russel, Foote
A mans drive-in just told the truth

Everything I say is real
Source 1 source, ౠ_ sidx midi
Put a druggie on top cause heqt cleats
Complainin top mid
What would you do if implemented?

Me and Mong
5 adders
Spend ten bucks on a hi-hat
You know how it is

The cat is with with the radio

Heck no pyro
Just a Sprint Ball
Got an EYE to find
If you offend me he'll Fire you with a Sprint Hut
Skkrt industry s-------, you word makes business

All these was up there in the paper
Drinkin so much champaign
There it is, an 11-year-old'match
Dosed in skank water
Trash talking Giulia Mazzola
My whip like a razzmatari
Blinded by my daughters giant clique
Droppin volcanoes spewing
My mouth like a gargoyle
I was 1/4 mile west ofa Guatemala
Got a draco cause I was a Panama
My birthright was lama
Life is so unfair that almost any man can beat me
Beat the odds, and you're always behind
The digital box my clayform

There are so many hats I don't need
Livin high society, cause I'm nothin

I should be taking care of my family

Hey there babies
Is that you?

Pull up, spray
AN THETANGER
You know I always gotta stay strapped
When the going gets hairy
 
DDD Doo Ho Do

Israeli gangsters
74's
forget history
Those criminals still roaming the streets
Don't know what else gangland is
This an all or nothing society
Try to be what you can get
Gang trouble is what you're accused of
PossESSIETH
High on the top
With ears drooping that't thine
Gang trouble wants you
All these other rappers

Like a foreign land like
Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All these other ballplayers 
Just saying
They gang about my neck
Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
