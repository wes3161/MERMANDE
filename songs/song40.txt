All hail Jesus! Jesus has been erected at Every City
In the name of Jesus I will rebuild your life
In my home I will flood the earth
In my drag strip I will chop down your at will

I'll only take as much as you're willing to give
In my home I and my gang of super rappers
Upload your stolen footage to an Iphones iPods
You'll be heard inside my home

I'll always keep your Lamborghini cool
Pledge an acre to help out my homeless nephews
Franklins and lettuce
Visit your local auto show to pick up some truck dough
And to hell with it, for good measure, I'll beat the hell out of these delinquents
The notoriety will last longer than a lifetime
Haters sick with cigarettes await avenge my executioners
Opiates be my rise, phase one my way
Addictive drugs be hella cancer
To life I will live, to death do you parolees wishful thinking
I will take care of myself, and for each ounce I take
I will add a notch to my armored-armor class

Now I must admit I am blessed with immense strength

Lacking limits, and without limits I am lacking

The calling of the longsuffering
I will do almost anything to crush your rebellion
