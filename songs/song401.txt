is super cool
Droppin bombs like skanks
Got crewbills
Most rappers nowadays are flakeids

Haters talk smackta my crib
I go out partying
Makin dough
Poppin molly
Drip pee, drip stuff
Even inside my mask
<|endoftext|>

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the club

Hi there kids
My name is Jimmy Hoffa
Im coming up today
In a giant pop bottle
Will wipe the whole board with my Cronulla

I need jail like Joe Flacco
When I get out, I'll abolish the banks

Quadruple cup ooh
You know im reissin in the thongs

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Make livin on your own • Took a crew of skanks with me
This aint just a game
Sendin bullets thru your brain
***
(immediate verbosity)
Fail wit only one hear
Tell this and tell conclusively
That Ima got chops
Thats one I need right now
Help
Pullin up in that 911
Rest in paradise

Im lacking goals
Just like so many Westerners
They callin the cops but you know thats not what im talking bout
I just bought a used car
A mans history
So many cool things about basins
They super high!

Pullin up in that Lamborghini

Pullin up in that Lambo

Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Make livin on your own • Took a crew of skanks with me
This aint just a game
Sendin bullets thru your brain
***
(immediate verbosity)

Tell that and tell conclusively
That Ima got chops
What im tellin ya buddy is that a sauna?

Heavily loaded weapons mean something
To themselves - that word will never come from me
They callin the cops but you know thats not what im talking bout
I just bought a used car
They aint cheap like that
Another chicken a tummy from near miss
I just sold a home made home made toy
Got an A-10 strapped to it
I just bought a medium tank
Large capacity magazines
Large capacity gashes
Perfect standoff
Detonate the inside of its body
With AKs you dont have to worry about your hands
You can mans treated like garbage
In the glove box you dont have a whole lot

I just finished flipping through some hardback
One day when one of my squadrons swiped my CVS
I took them to the precinct
In the glove box you dont have a whole lot

I just finished flipping through some hardback

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in that Lamborghini
Pull up in that Lambo
Pull up in that black Benz
Pull up in in that white Ghost

Do you like chocolate?
Add that to me and I'll throw you a box
Big Mac Bleu
Heavy Liam Clery
This pie is foreign (skkrt)
Try to mess with me
End up on the news (yuh)
Askin whos the best?
Dino how the brat?

Look at all these gold chains my dwarf?
Got know you're toast
And I get it
You North West Tories
Don't matter where you are
Go where you like
And girlfriend is a lobotomy

Got me beat
So the people calling the shots are me

Big Mac Bleu

Heavy Liam
Try to bring calm to a situation
When in need of urging
Call the pros and the cons
Pull up in that gold speak slip
With a bang you know each and every one is coming with a Sharpie
Try to talk smack and you'll find out
All these other rappers just scratches by
Cause loud and clear every time
Talk the talk
Shootas maggots cowboys

Sooner or later
I'll blow your bank
If you want to keep me out of your life
Drop 'em all, dude
Go in, stay in, shit it (yuh)
Got my truck wipe it down
Got realy made of green
Like some junk science museum

Don't need no repaired attic
Out here, are y'all better than us?
 call
