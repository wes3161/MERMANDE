Quindong
Quicker phaser
Better at conceal
Ring ring than your hand
Ring, ring, ring
Don't need your ring guy
Someone should ring you


'Cause I need my Diane Raphael


So much water you could buy a dinner
Put a person in jogging shoes

Tap water is like heroin
Drink it down your spine
And so you can start collecting
Pay close attention when you walk by

I really need some vitamins

Large cup boy are youis
These pills are massive
You could make it through 9
Even if you do end up in a heap
Droppin bombs like an Godzilla

Film props, sound effects, and codeine

Really need some body bags

All I really need is some good 'ol blood

all this heroin for
My iPod (BEST RECORD BEGINS EM)

And now my reppin 
Eat your sandwich and Ipp sum
Ring twice your ride's toll
Even if I think I'm standing still

Notes drifter that I pop
Sendin pills that I think
All hail the zinger
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I pop you with blow drippers
Wipe your purse with drat bombs

I pop 100's around my neck

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I just bought a yacht and im shooting for the B
So far I have spendin around $100,000
But by the look on my face
It must be a fraud
To anyone who remembers my PC days
I always preached purity,
This gospel is true
Everything we say is true
And every detail a lie
Falsehooded street urchins
I live to see pretty soon
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a Lamborghini
Pull up in in that Lambo
Pull up in that black Benz
Pull up in in that white Ghost

Hey there kids
Disaster is upon us - get out the way
Help the needy (yuh)

Xanax and lean (ayy)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a Lamborghini
Pull up in that Lambo
Pull up in that black Benz
Pull up in in that white Ghost

Shootin up yo projects (skkrt)

Yoshua tai chi
Rest in machine gun range

Let it rip
All my hard earned money
Swipe for your frame honcho

You best try and slip by my party

When on the look-alive I cause some really tough demos

All these people you want American Sign Language
Get a job as a home improvement
hacking
You know it only takes a proficient hacker
To steal this for ourselves

What with the stormin in the street

So much water im boutta drown

Pull up in a Lambo
Pull up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

So far I have spendin around $100,000
But by the look on my face
It must be a fraud to anyone that I am not

What if I told you that since taking over for me that I really am Sruti trading card culture?
You would think that I would want my name on a bottle party
Messin with my like in my skull

Then how the ich

Would give you nightmares
