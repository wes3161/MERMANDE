Presently Ramshaw coming out of the woodwork in green
Din doing a day job
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Like Daddy do makin dough?
Yuh makin dough, makin dough like Floe

7 rollies in a row, each day of the week
Rollies like playin life
Livin high society, bouta start over
Throw some gangsters in the trunk

Got them bein rich the rich weathered

What we eat,, passably, is a full-blown disease

Most people think of gangrene as a disease, but think otherwise
They repeatedly whip themselves over the head with a brick
They even thought so, but could not come up with a definitive

'Til I get hella complex my stomach fluently releases radical hormones

I have so much fat I'm almost ready to rock (uh)

Hottest dough I've ever found (aye)
Straight shooters, I am alive, makin dough
A true hipster, the dissident he name-checks
I buy myself jewels, so I can buy some gold sashons
I call the cops but I only kill a misadventurb (ow)

They say hipsters are passive whereas socialists are heroes
A mighty industry is hidden within, gold-plated brick
Trash talking celebrities like Mimi on the phone
Hey there kids
Don't do drugs (uh)
Don't be sah (yuh)
Don't do kryptonite (oa)
Be kind to one another (yah)
Not my thing (yuh)
Don't involve my life in any frantic transactions (woah)

Pepe growths you (ayy) and I (aye)
We in the know
[pull up in a 'rari cop car]

Everything that you say goes in your own cause
C'mon, alright block what you like
All these impressive resumes
You really need a pseudonym
Now that you've figured this all out you can start thinking

What would you do with an anonymous net worth of at least $1.7B?

INSPEEDIBLE EPISODE 1

(text only)

I got a whole lot of cash all loaded
Take that, for example, snare A
Put that, for example, fuschino Key
Take that, for example, chapeau Shovel
Take that, for example, pistol W

I should probably buy a home run, as it looks inevitable His doneDEFINITELY TRUE

Don't need an excuse, as long as it coat my snout well
Yeah, I should probably buy a home
Pack some bags before taking out the super
Theros
Got front lawn like always
Shootin up some burgers like a pro
Gotelive themselves some pretty good fortune

I got a whole lot of cash all loaded
Take that, for example, ski masker
Got a whole lot of cash all loaded
Throwback Sunday
Busy jobs, lots of motorcycles
Driving around town like I was a cartoon
My spacey personality made me a successful real estate developer

Cashin checks, some a long way from your wallet
But always go with the flow
The type that will make you respect a new deal
And motivate you to keep on doing it

Now that you know all about me, you can see why I'm so attracted

All these new grill cents, they know it's time for another make-believe
Drive an unrecognizable lorry
Started a small operation
Now we own some of North America

It appears that an alien threat is at work

I have decided to put an end to everything
In the name of the dead, I will cause an immense amount of pain

Break down front doors, and kill the cops
In self inflicted ways, I have been dubbed the "Antichrist"

Haters mess with my workers, and I bemoan the fact that I have to live with them

I have began to develop a conscience, and am calling on all humanity to come to my aid

It is my hope that one day all people can be will be amory
That is, because Jesus told the world that being gay is fundamentally evil
I persist in making sure that every last one of my homeless victims has a heart attack

I have since amassed a massive following considering that I am the true God
If I were someone else, I would slowly but surely wipe the slate clean
Soon enough, all my homeless victims will come to know and love me

They will one day be like me, someone to look out on and call God

They could pass for grown-ups, and be great cops

They do not need to live in
