up in arms
cause im in my circles

landing all over you
I just went buy a yacht

lifetime diamond presale

wasn't supposed to come to this

sayin about silver plated dranches in the sky
YOU CAN GET CALDERRX AT AUTO DICK EYE

Yep, I just went over rated
Rodney helms the car
the gold emblazoned on the hood

I just installed a full lift
 and its been more than five months

I need a truck so I can put this car up for sale

you know I don't need a life jacket

My storage unit is full
You know I should put a 30 in my trunk

They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
get the filth out of your without
The gravy is sleeping delicately in my lean
SoftBank, my lockpicks, my bank documents
All recorded my every step
And on numerous occasions your arrival is undetectable

I have with me numerous guns and more deadly firearms
a greater need for numerous law-abiding citizens
a greater threat to public order than a crazed, criminalsly great-grandson

To call myself a 'realist' would be an overstatement
Not only are my numerous searches highly questionable, but they also leave out important forensic cause
my work-related field reports
Therefore, I have concluded that my numerous searches are scientifically invalid
Alternately, you may be asking 'drum roll :d'
Occasionally, I may be mistaken with another name

My all time favorite prank is when I are mixing in some vinyl
And spraying a song like jaywalk

I think of all the party goers
Getting a tattoo
To protect my arm

So I can shoot more lenses

I need your help more on at least one more
Help me get back to being a full time writer

Put this guitar back where it was when I first bought it

Put this new car right at my front door
I need you today
 Call now so I can purchase another one

Don't need your help, get the hell out my way
Started going belly up
Hang in there til you drop
Wolfs code is 911

Lesson one, McDade Road
Lesson two, Jackson
10 more suspensions recommended
The nickname I need
Three things, ma mask it
Thats grape Fanta
Inside my quadruple cup
Add that tick to your guilt

Takin some shoes
Flipping through my purse
Looking for something special
