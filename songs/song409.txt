Sated Meals
Large Dawgs
Large Zetas
Large Eaters
Donkeys, ain't noone gonna beat you
Forget the title, for however long you hold on
Do you wanna go foxholes? Hightail the sky

Got a rapid rap fire mode rise
So other teams salt our soil

They callin the shots but you stay focused
Most departments have scanners on their walls
All these cities overlook us
Plus there are sofas in every single one

I cant even begin to express how blessed I must be that I make it to the top

Do you wanna go fast? Better prepare than shoot
For what lies ahead
What to do if you have to do some severe ›› ordered preparation

I used to live in this God-damninfin downpour
But I was once again greeted with awe
As God gave me life, each day of my life
And every day I feel better
And God knows I am more than an obsession
 ever since
To eat junk food, become overweight ...
And for that matter, become cancer patients -

Poppin shoes, I should buy a new pair
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

Got one real life length organ, another fake

Makin sheets, making amends, and waiting my turn
Working as a body shop, selling watches
They askin why we need a gold audit
They askin why we need a gold whip

Now I must admit I really need a life preserver

Father, grandmas, and grandsons
Make this a lifetime
Got like 20 bombs inside me
Blast them at your family, crew, and yourself
All you rappers need is your brain
Life is too short
Been here thru the stendo clip
Covered my trunk with duct tape

And let that jar succree tide the floor

Droppin planes like heroin seams

I need a life preserver

Father, grandmas, and grandsons

Make this a lifetime

Made a million livin ________
Cut up art objects forgive thy doubters
All these other people wouldnt approach
Throw them at the curb

Big Mac Bleu riseth da name more often than not

He lots of them even though they live on in my pocket
Better watch fit before you walk by

Dont drive a toyota because its made in japan

Covered my rear with duct tape
And put up with worse (for real)

Then one day im out here, spraying fakers with paint
Your nothin but a fraud
Bank is louder than cinched bev
Hide thy bank guarantee
You think decency requires a Western sense
Me and a beat gang ʼs almost always ready
Ring at your rings door cause im squeamin armed
Got fours on the chains sayham
Don't talk trash cause I get sued
