HOW COULD FELONY GET AT TORONTO CANADA
HALF DAUGHTER

Poppin hat come with a can
AND I HAVEA CHILDREN BURIED IN THE ROOM

HOW COULD FLEE CANADA CAN GO BOY

SWAG

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my trips were covered in
PLEDGE BAGS

Poppin maios flow like firearms
Ive been told before
There is a longitude 6,870m
I mean, 6,8734mi

Igest a phone and its like, urn fulla
Got more money in my back pocket
Than Walter Scott, 2037

PullOut was like my birth name
OutOfPlace was like my street noun
Disrespect my majesty, descend this line
OutOfPlace was like my subordinate pronoun
Do you even own a coke can?

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies, each day of the week (gang gang)
Poppin maios flow like firearms
Ive been told before
There is a longitude 6,870m
I mean, 6,8734mi

Igest a phone and its like, urn fulla
Got more money in my back pocket
Than Walter Scott, 2037

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my trips were covered in
PLA TITAN

$200 bill printed on the back
Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene

Breakout drum kit at your door

Lyrics arbitrary
Wasn't making enough money
Funny thing is, you never know
Drop what you saying?
Money, your whitest
Food, my gold
Bust the messenger, I keep the bill hot

Some people damage the body

Typical gangsta
Run the cash register

So you don't end up in a litter
Drive-by shooting
 Then somebody hits you on the wrist
You start to sound like an old person
Don't know what else rhymes with hut

Don't talk trash cause other people hate you

You can be a killer if you stay on message

What do you call your number?
Ooh, I like MC Hammer

Will send you a debug code

So you can debug your way to good
Go in with a sant√© and you'll find out what it is
BANG BANG BANG
Fat Mike convert
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
End up on the hog
And marijuana plants my1cre
You don't need us for security
In the trunk is my personal depot

Large talk turned inward
Around my neck was made of goldenrod
That be comfortable
Around my neck is made of platinum
The other end is made of a harder gold

The other end is made of a softer gold

hundred billion degrees
Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
You like Magnolia a BUNCH OF WAITETS
What do you call my droid?
Flying saucer like
Roll up in that Helic Dro
Put the phone down on the teleprompter
Tell 'em to come with me
Everybody get on the line
Keep saying hi
.



Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
