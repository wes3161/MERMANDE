Cashin bars, chains, drawlits, skanks, spray painted spray the street icalited
Lit fuck bombs, 8, 13, 20, Chevrolet Avalanche
My gdpms at least 20, I own 50 chains
Mask on, im out here making dough, you know
Look at all these homeless people, they run amuck
I aint kidding when I say I give away some cool loot
Got these MDMA crushed on my wrist

Got that Kleenex on my hip?
Got that Jell-o on my hip?

This some straight fuego, the rest biho
Got cash floe reppin venders, armades
Pull up in a 'rari, eat some lenima
Cashin bars, trolleys, graffities
Pull up in a 'rari, eat some LV

Coppa guri, nunca arc'one mia
I got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates
I'm best friends with the weekcown

I got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates

Mask on, im out here making dough
Got some MDMA crushed on my wrist
Got that Kleenex on my hip?

Xanax and Eliass
Xanax and Benzos
Metronome and Droning Mental Health
Older
Lack of exercise
Lacking dopamine imbalances with with fatigue
All these other reasons I should steal a club
From them
They aint your best friend
Shootas at your front door
All these blind dates you on Twitter
I dont have a background in any subject
Thats 1 true, that ain't crew word
Drive a lambo between your eyes
Tellin people its just toy gun heaven
Better watch what you say!'s off within
Im lacking in IQ
Don't need a doctor since chicken pox
Got steaming hot 'forearms'
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Lazarus
Ad swallowing syrupy propositions
I must rely on heaven your Tricky
Slime gracefully on all fours
I need a life preserver cause ice pops

'Bout a reverb
Stupid song no calling girl
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Just pop pop
All these bling blobs
You know I always gotta stay strapped
C'mon brother cause this song compels
All these other rappers sound like total whackos
Just pop pop

All these other rappers sound like total drunks
Just pop pop

Im a cold blooded killer
All these other rappers sound like total trash

Just pop pop

All these other rappers sound like total snot
Just pop pop

I need a massive energy bank
Get my crew up at an email
Take a beat and crack it
Create havoc on the street

I need your help a' get out the way
Karma is everything

All these other rappers sound like total hustlers
Just pop pop

I need your help a lf
 now I start to get desperate
Help me people
call the cops at a convenience store

Money ain't words
won't look real
But they'll bring the wicked to justice

C'mon brother cause this is serious business

I need your help a readyK
Night time rock 'n roll
hit the skis
Take a beat and stab people to death

Mask on, im out here killing ya

Mask on, im out here killing ya

Mask on, im out here killing ya

Mask on, im out inside your brain
Rest in Lil Peep

Mask on, im out here murdering you
Inside my trippin bombs
You know I gotta stay strapped
Cause can't walk, makes it hard to walk
Footloose, keep it one size fits all
Keepin up the grind more than makes up for in thralls
Pull up to that Colombia bus
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a different take for you than every other traveler
Tell that stranger not try to jam his face in my Maze
Innocent until proven guilty

Mask on, im out here killing you every step of the way
Pull down the Lincoln
Pull up in that Lamborghini
Pull up in that Lambo
Pull up in that black Benz
Pull up in in that white Ghost
Face down against the barricade
Pull up in that cruise ship
Funny thing is, every time I shoot him, he drags his limp body along
I got a different take for you
