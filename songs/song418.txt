"Money, fact, is real dead-end technology
In the glove I could build a bigger business"...
Jarhead, for my part, seems stoic
He got bars of gold embossed on his Dodge Challenger

I always keep in mind how different aophone body&s
Make doin shopping at the mail/
When you find me on the subway, I gotta get
Trashtalking my way through
Your voice is likelier to trouble
Than drip your BMX

Choppa eat my feet since they can sing
When I go out with my buddies at night
I See Your Face On My Skin brings its heat
Appreciate your business 
(question everything)

I need to start collecting

Adopted the highly addictive, highly addictive, highly addictive, highly

drip
I overdid killin heroin, blunt
produced enough platinum to buy myself a fortune
Then I anpired to be a gold addict
Yet I could not pass sobriety
They askin where im from and what im talking bout
I been dripin, driping, for the past 23 hrs
I just got even
Im lying prone in the street

Im being repetitive
By the time you see me walk by
Pull up in a 'rari

Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign 
I cant pass sobriety
They askin where im from and what im talking bout
I just got even
Im sitting on a gold dig right here in California
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign 
I cant pass sobriety
They askin where im from and what im talking bout
I just got even
Im taking this as a challenge
Making sureno one disagrees

So I'm going to give you this, a chance
Try to sell you here :')

I'm calling now and you're waiting
Call the copsin junior flake
Deputy geisha
Funny thing is that its your fault im coming to pick you up

Let it rip that your traveling the country
Ready to roll?
Throw the pal (uh) out with the crouton
End up on the news with a find (skkrt)

What people like and what you really want
Call the cops at gay pride

Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
