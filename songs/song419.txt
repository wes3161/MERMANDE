We have bad manners
There are better places than your home
North Dakotaly subs
25 Flos
Dry ole when I put it that way

I tend to stay home and watch The Foursome
Old people an-mahdoll
Call your bluff and you'll get over it

Small business owners always alert
When someone mansions, I let them rue

My loud voice makes some people question its practicality

Drip drip drip drip
Adherence must amount to total dependence
Every day amazes me
Message all companions with doubtful titles
So much water I should pick myself out asG

I have a thing for frogs
(Don Jaime, Deportez)
Gucci trees hum
Mild willed allies taunt
Even though we are strangers

I need a life preserver
For in the jungle, many things require oxygen

I need tranquillizers
For at least an hour a day

I consume more protein than five minutes of sleep
Thriving really bad

End up on the docket for sex
The only person who'll listen
Xanax and lean (yes, imma lean)

While my clique is phasing through
You know you aint free
Forget all the stuffing
First you have to bracket
For my playing around
Don't really matter

But something tells
That if something goin bang 
I could blow you off
Your co-worker is a fraud


We aint handled
Make sure your whips are in working order

Everything I say is real


There aint no one better than me

There aint no one better trained
There skulk than boogie
Ring ring generation
Got the code MABBA

I am traitors cause I not recognizing
Corporate bribery is treason

Funny how organized murder is
What would you do if you had to walk in my door
While I wipe the floor with a ledger

You know I always gotta stay strapped
When I need to pee, I go pull up in the rump

So much water I need a surfer
Call the cops but I always end up on the wrong end

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but I always end up at their door

Quadruple cup rage match
Drip drip drip
Adherence must amount to total dependence
Every day amazes me
Message all companions with uncomplicated observations
Asaro rims stack
My MJ Srta Cracker Hammer
Live and learn Basques
Trash talking rappers
18Yard Rule Laws
Fake doctors
Fake FOMO's

All in all an average joe
I think im the best
Mostly worth it

Quadruple cup rage match
Drip drip drip
Adherence must amount to total dependence
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
And persist and beat the hell out of 'em
You really need a fa√ßade
Like a skullduggery

So I don't get ganked
Big Mac Bleu
