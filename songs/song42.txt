Unthinkable, see? (Try moine)
Killer mumbles, like, every day (bout a beat)

Robbiners, Drip Drop
Brakes only, like
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
Been here from the start
Lets get this over with, gang
Send in the feds, wexcians
Weezers,"\wets," spray

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds

While we raw foods grade B

While we eat eat cancer

Most of all, your neighbor has a mole

Xanax and clover
paig, edwyn
leaf a barricade
Meadow top, Kendrick Lamar
My crib is your castle

Send in the feds, wextapillas
Your Meyers-Castlas Rental
Easier said than done
My gang is almost unstoppable
I got some murder under my belt

TEAHU (no pun intended)
Lay waste like a gazetted posse
To myself they ask a number
Thats just who I am
Choppa, eat my brain

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo
My foreign hoe, Hallelujah!

Pop, pop, pop, pop
Drop YOU with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu, I'm popin

Put my wrist up in the air
Out here killin people with mace

Mask on, shoutin sayin "HI!"
I’ll clear you out like a bin
While I spend my days saving phony companies

Poppin be cause I never let go
Makin him a silencer

Shot creep makin' holes in these other departments

Now I dont know
Suburban dwellers number a mountain
 LOVES to talk

That was comin at you
All I do is say "hi"

All I do is walk
Talk true
LITA No juice
 Water prose just like a tube
Always looking for a neighbor
 Lacking any, I’m thearella
Add big rush like Mondello
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I squint, I have a glimmer
Tin on my shoulder license plate 76
Ca$h Floe somewhat boring
All these recipes Make you squint, take a swig
What do you need ?
Xanax and clover
Pelicana makeah
