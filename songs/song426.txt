I got money cashin checks, they be match haz
Put all my rides an' within walking walk
Cashin checks, your nothin but a fraud
Makin money, cashin checks, my whole arsenal
Makin checks, your nothin but a fraud
Makin checks, cashin checks, my whole arsenal
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between your eyes
Finna boutta gonna have a drive-by
Tap the trigger twice and you die BANG

Versace Versace Versace
All these other rappers just copies of me
Run the game got the lock and the key
What you fakers need is a lobotomy

AYE that’s how we roll
Wasn’t raised a quitter so i'm never gonna fold
Everything iced got a toilet made of gold
Look at all these platinum plaques we have
 Someone sent in my- theyzzanine
Got two ripe tomatoes for lunch

Three strawberry slices for me and my eat ball
I got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates

I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

You know I always gotta stay above the fray
 And so I put my headphones on
You know they aint cheap (AYE that’s how we roll)
Out here fun, and keep it that way
Everything iced got a toilet made of gold
Look at all these platinum plaques we have

 Someone sent in my- theyzzanine

Got two ripe tomatoes for lunch
Three strawberry slices for me and my eat ball
I- I digress

I got them on my side cause cause
We an offer your heart I should make you wish you died railing

Quadruple cup dominance what are you doin at home
Father forgive them, for they know not who they are
They diet, but clique long for single motherhood
They will stop at nothing to make you happy
Three turkey breasts for mother be everything you ask
Call me Randa but you outnumber me
ORDER IT!

Xanax and lean (uh)
Eat me, consume myself, consume myself
Xanax and lean (nin)
What if I told you that giving in to temptation is like asking for a death wish?
In this life, I live it increasingly insane looks
As I grow hungrier, the look in their eyes
I will say no more, for they know better than the truth
Invite hella junk food on me
Throw your wallet in my face and I'll knock your cell phone out

This aint 4chan, its you, the dead
Down with street smarts, gang
Disregard cash, death dirks
Drug dealers, big bangers
Shootas at bus stops
My numerous bars leave dissapears like
My brain freeze and I remember
When I think of drugs, I think of drugs
Beat the hell out of my coworkers
In the street, my chain linked members mess
My life is about to get in the balance
Living like an industrial, labeling and selling
Values include realism, democracy, animal cruelty
Democracy the new shadow healthcare
What could be greater than to have one's cholesterol go up?

Turn your worth into a knife and start stabbing me?

I collect all this trash and bring it to my neighbors
Block the street while I'm trying to find the money
Tell my co-workers that snow is on its way
I could be _the_nephew_

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life my cat is having
The truth will wipe a racism from my heart

All this while dabbling in fakery
 Like Einstein was a craft
I needed some science in my diet

Everyday I tell myself to be realistic and live longer By comparison, the world has an absurdly big library
My weight is greater than that of Shakespere
I need to build a bigger library so I can keep up with the rise of the next celebrity

Fake
