Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash

Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They askin where im from and what im talking bout

I got so much money I could buy the Dow
Got the stendo clip and I aint never play around

Better watch what you say fore I snap
Roll up on yo crib and we go brat-a-tat-tat
Thats one for your head two for knees three for your back
Everything I say is real motivated blabber
To myself 'bout to deactivate compraders
Responsible for at least one triple murder
Brought chaos to the militias
Brought contemporary hip-hop to a stand-still
Dedicated first responders a billion times
I’m ridiculously tall and thin meaning that I can’t walk
My intelligence makes it almost impossible for an underling to track me
I have been quickly apprehended by peacekeepers
Upon hearing that news, I immediately broke down
As I expected, I had been looking for a new home

When I approached the squad car with the gun in my lap, I walked straight for you

There, I said it, come here me Snax ($10-$20)

All I do is say that
When you find out that we is real the like
And that they is legit hi

So much money that its almost like we are a family
In the bank, I own the whole skyscraper
My kingdom come true, give it a whirl
Give it a whirl I an your not bad
Shoot it up and we are at the top

Much like Jesus said, there is a greater atwork of your every motion
What you do on this earth is done, done at its highest
You who believe, do you hip?
Before I punish you, whip out your whip
For you, delinquents are on the run
Don't need all these chores, I am the beat 'em
Drop 30 on your face and I'm sure they're nagging
