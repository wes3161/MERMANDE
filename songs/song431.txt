I dont need any purple in my hair

And xanax and yarmoss
Â¿Coco spacing
Mexican spanish folding
Mac running around like negative
Verbal attacks like lobotomizing people
Drug involved, murder is rampant
My numerous bars leave frustrated muggles
Shootin upabaloo
And dispatch squires

They say hiphop is merely poetry
But rappers need a serious hip Hop
Now I must admit I think a hundred words isn't enough
I need verse
 Promotes his cause
Passes me using hip hop as a whip
I startles the homeless guy
I finally talk to myself

I need to meditate

I need to rewire my brain

I must grow a thicker bra
Start saving tomorrow

I hate the rap scene
Fake rappers are on the way

They are and gone are abominations
Disabling people is the best medicine

Love over art

So you know its a start of work
Run the 'rari and get 'ell hrs
Keep in mind that its not my cup

Hi there people
Im new to the party
Lifestyle is a big no-no
Started stealing around
Got more money in my back pocket
Got the cash floe
All these diamonds I could ever need
Got all this ready to climb
Got the work cutscene
I need your help more than ever
