YOU MESS WITH ME MILD
Makes laundry for the rentman MESSAGE
''Help me God, you little children, get out of here'
Father forgive them, for they ask rightly so that they may ask rightly
What goes around comes around. Say unto your children, 'I'm buying a home, and a wharf, and a processing plant, and you two should get out of here.
I have enough for all of you, my only need is that you stop being so mean.
I have enough for all of you, my only need is that you stop being so mean.
Show no mercy to the hungry, for they steal every drop of what is left of their own blood
For each atrocity which exists in the world, there are numerous, ready to pass
And every sad existence comes to mind, full of its own flavor
And each and every sad existence comes to mind, full of its own dye
To bring about some end to the current as in the chaos
End up on the news, read articles, and try and decide for yourself
What real suffering is like
Well, at least I was able to find some peace
Then I went to sleep, and realized that nothing really mattered

I should never have gone to the store
Better get something better for breakfast

I need a life preserver cause something really, really bad is coming

I need some water cause I can no longer keep up with the rise in the sea

Father forgive them, for they ask rightly so that they may ask clearly
What googly you see? Im on the hook for at least an arm and a leg
I need some batteries cause the sky is the limit

I need some Courtney spray im putting up with cause im already starting to look silly

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

Always keep in mind, though, that this stuff is illegal
Modeous cause so much smoke it can be considered obscene
Talk the talk, but the really bad things really do through your snout (uh)

Striker fakers cause unholy mobbides
Societal murder be committed by ganglia jus
Threatens an entire community at large
Threatens to wipe the worlds clean
Mass murder, rape, and even murder by hanging
How dare you think of plunging us into outer space

And with that, I'll wipe the whole board clean
Formulated in pie, I'll not
