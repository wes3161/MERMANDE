True Icelandic, skimpy, full-render shouta Allah, ain't havin no sonn at his front door loty buzz
Go big or go darlin clap (dance big)
Lyrics comin at your service
Everything I say is real
Talkin bout your boom
You Filipino, I'm△ant
Hella business man, put my bag in the glove
Got a little somethin fresh to say

Anything can happen
.

Lyrics comin at your front door
Layin at the dump, cleaning the mess

I got a new 722 with more than a passing boil
Tell that to my Korean Hustle match
I live at home with my wife and child
3D printed motorcycles, empty synapses
My sister may or may not be with you

I have bags in my lap that I keep
Wegoin through our make-believe

Poppin pumps, wringing coals
I build renewable energy solutions
I use my elephants for medicine

I overdid it, and it worked
I should've known better
I should've known better
Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Do damage control
Always stay trained (Shoot)
What you drinking paraphernalia for
I am actually unconscious and must be in some sort of surgery

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies, each day of the week (gang gang)
Poppin molly, you know i never sleep (no i dont)
Got money, money money money (large cash)
Straight shooters, you know we we aint funny (kevin hart)
Your girl need vitamins, i give her sunny d (nutrients)
She aint your girl, if she coming home with me (large cash)
Number 1, hottest in the street (heatwave)
Lit as hell, like we drinking gasoline (exxon)
Pull out my Draco, spray it to the beat (gang gang)
I’m always cool, but I still bring the heat (goldbond)
200 thou, for that Actavis (codeine)
I am so loud, like an activist (large cash)

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between your rear legs
For crying out loud

Kristin starcrossed out
Started to mess with my a***
And by my a***
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies, each day of the week (gang gang)

Step inside Kristin and get her circulated
She aint tiny, if you ask her her- Self  (yuh)
She aint tiny, even without a hood on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies, each day of the week (gang gang)
Put some on your wrist and an on your arm
Ring in the date and you're good to go
Plus you should check out my new album 
Drop 30 and you're great friends
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies, each day of the week (gang gang)
Shoot every rhyme in your soundbit
And every rap track is nineX the word a b
Lit as a**
Got more guns than an Army base
Got myself some really bad rap
So much water I should be taking a trip

Made like $
