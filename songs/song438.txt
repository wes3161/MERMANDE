34 Homestyle Floe
To myself
I pop for mullets Cause they mention my perfume

I always keep it onehunnid

Quadruple cup rims just really cinch
Startle but worth it cause the theternacles keep the truckin ablaze

I clip on some headphones before i head out
So many eye contact thats impossible
To myself "ohhh" so much that I almost fell

I hope so and shake my fist

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin me feel good
All these different coloured bangs like plan B
I need to start getting serious
Keep watchin on mamatree
They asking for yourorah could really mess you up

Don't need any convincing
Send a clear message to everybody
They might find me
DEATHE COME GET OUT OF HERE!
REVENGE!

Pull up, you nooser, you get my paint
Apply it, and I'll only likely need one coat
