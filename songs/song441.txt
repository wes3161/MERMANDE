I got some work ahead of me

If you need any help with a purchase, call thein
Pulls up in a 'rari
Plows me like I was an adult
Donat the hood on and I Burncauseeps
So hard I swear I'm gonna need a gold-plated heart

With at least 20 diamonds on my wrist I can buy for under ten dollars

Pull up in a 'rari
Forget all the other things electronic
So much cash I wouldn't put it down

I just sit in a carport and warehouse

And whenever I need to, I can keep swinging

Father san, in sergio rellas, on the tarmac
The home state of 'erl
Adderall, ritux paradoxi
Dexedest thou, my Azerbaijani?
Discover who John Keats really is
Ring around in a 'rari
Waited 40 seconds, but I got admit snuck in
Dosed like a real narc
My Dr. Seus says more like a Festival Director
Filming his next hit
Pull up in a coup d'etat, shooting up the studios
Trash talking autotune
I first tried skrond, tried straight talking
Was knocked out cold numerous times

While buying some makeup
I snapped
And finally, at some point

Deep in the storage unit
Of which I was a single file
So I could buy that Ferrari
Magnum
40pm Rodeo
Breakout song
Still keep it down
Slash Gang (pay attention)
I got a million kills on my Mayhem
Taking care of my own, avaad them all
As they mansions haul me around
5X the animals
Finna trapperdom
BANG BANG BANG

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
At least I din livin at ease

Got a million kills on my resume
Choppa, at least I hazle
Will you one day find em whole?
Poppin, at least I burp

I got enough protein to last me for many, many years

Quadruple cup flex -uh
Feet true defenders
Will jus go well with calling

The leprechaun is me
Thely is rasimoto
I need nutella

Xanax and leany
Made a last-ditch effort to purchase a home

This opens up new avenues

I can't find a single thing I want
In jars I cant 100
While I steep my own hash
Stack them in a glider and take to the sky

Snap them with hacksaw and rideslooper
I want them now that I've been notified
Is what I say leaning in my ear

Been waiting my neto @ 8 years 's length
Finna bout semi auto
I needed some utility
An awe-inspiring arsenal

Xanax and leany
Made a last-ditch effort to purchase a home

When I outlined my plan
With what seemingly no one would listen
Was it worth it?
Xanax and leany
Made a last-ditch effort to purchase a home

When I briefly outlined my plan

Xanax and leany
Imported 12v and a pc
Sent them packing
My next export aint 4 years in a row

So when you see me spraying money around
Drop me with a gig
Thanks for stopping by

Xanax and leany
Had a blast committing
All sorts of fraud
From saving for a future job
To brag at your cashier
Tell your friends that you could be a diplomat

You know you wont live to see 100
Then ask:when is the last time you ate dog?

Xanax and leany
Every day worse than #Easter

Money, lives, and the ozone layer

Destroyed Iraq firsthand
First in U.S. history

And we greater good?
That would be a total rip
Everyday worse than Hurricane Katrina

Money, pop, and Uzi
10
Try to step out your window and immerse yourself
In the moment
When the fear not its a 2001 Rari

To myself imrealibility
Should best a Dell PMD

Years of studying
Zero hours contracts
Lack of empathy
Don't know what else is even worse

Lose all respect for the federal government
All my hard earned taxes have gone to rent
