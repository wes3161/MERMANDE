There isn't space for 38 jets
Out here fuel a suspicion drive
Remove the evidence
Put an end to rumor mill

My whips deal
Drip drip drip
Fed up with Republicans trying to kill us
Run me over on the street

Mask on, say something big
Mask on, say something dumb
Don't want any brotherhoods
Sendin shots at your family
And I bring the pain
By the truck corner comin>
Throw up in the counter
Bringin bars, crowbars
I'm bringin high, \ "Lets get this under control
We gon' get the party started
Start with the beginning, and get to the intermediate-, mid-' to long-term goals
The rap game is simple: you can mess with me really fast
You should build bigger and better machines
I could build the tallest home I could afford
Im the real hunter, don't do drugs

Wipe my Cash Floe with a Knight Rengl
 Weiners-type jobs

Trash talking celebrities
Good looking teens
Lived at known drug markets
Got box office Floe puns

If I went to Mexico City I probably stashed it somewhere pitiful

Pullin up in that spaceship
Got a weapons system my class could like
Are you serious?
Ive been coming here since day one
 Working, consuming and drinking
 Now there I go get ain glass

Feels great when I walk out the door

He told me so
Really?
My best money BeenYourTil-Nuts-20hrs-Run-I-D-III-Me-The-Number-I-Got-I'm-Filthy (Live Aid)

Workin at 100%, Drip, drip, drip
Drop what you have, shove it to the curb
Drip drip drip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't roll up in my tracks

I got more money in my back pocket than the IRS (Easy Money)

I watch you drip, drip, drip
Don't thank mister cup niggas for that IRS TAX TAX TAX TAX

Makin you dissapointed
Try to beat the system and you gon end up on a waitlist

So I wouldn't fill in blank

Keep an open book
Keep an open mind

For years
