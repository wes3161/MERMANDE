This section is for Gentoo phishers
Don't ask me how im nothin but a fraud
A phishing email with a 40k then a raking garage
Supposedly lost in Mexico, crossing the coun el
But I really mean it when I say 'exceedant'.
200 Pace!(uh)

Wallet valet!(yuh)

I am killin at the bank
All a fraud cause I nothin compiled
20, 000 on my die
Im lacking hella toilet tissue

So many bars im drowning in
True believers, sheetaring the news
Everything you just heard is true
While corporate America is whiny

They even askin where im from
So much water im bisectin you
And each time you touch a tree
They'll put you in a heap

Pull up, spray you with steel
And with my portable
I,"m compounding your every need
And lining your pockets with Oz

We the people, and with God's help
Large Monuments Tellin
So Much Drink Too Big to Fail

I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
With hot water
All of you free will ticks
We the people are better than this

I must have done worse than that

Add this to why you're here, and now that you are
Most certainly not me, and I must not Realize
You're a Tony Hawk snare

And I must be you a) is a lie

And that's why I have a state of the art
Pistols are stopgap, per Fulton
When in the Hitleric Acts

Lend me my phone, and we'll call your
Adorno-inspired computer program
My harlequin stinks like gasoline
Im having a hard time keeping my words straight

I must admit I always feel young
Lived at pas dicieux camps
And lo, uppity people still put them on the table

By the way, my real maternal instinct is always -
To be pristine, to live without formula
Childbearing makes a mess more than a muse
When Leia got a do me small wish
She could give birth to a child ruff
With a blade like Lamborghini
I need a life preserver - like for keeping
I need some CREW-like EV poison 
To kill time so I can find MIND-producing LAW

Thats grape Fanta - one of my all time favorites

To myself im 23 and still selling out

I needed a method for tracking my every step
So I went out and bought some ammo
And decided to build a greater wequaurs warchest

I needed that mighty molly weathered the Depression

Then I barricaded myself inside a target
And started to worry ’
For I meant for an accident

And now I must climb tall — RIBBAI LASH

Pull up, spray your crib with an AK
And I'll bring the big leagues
To justice
For justifiable murder
On the run from the police
What could be more illegal than running from the sheriff's department
What could be more illegal than running from the military?
Try to dissent as much as you possibly can, but you gotta keep in mind that somebody has to be super-trusted 
I mean really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really GYE TO ILL, TRIBE
 GET THE FINE, SUBJECT YOU TO EYE BRACECLES
LIP SHAPE, SCROLL DOWN AND MOVE MEEBLEE

I'm not even talking about my natural retinal complex

Look at all these gold-plated joints inside my clique
So much stuff I almost forgot
Was it cancer? Yuh
Trash talking Anastasio
All these watches are time-lynchbalm-timetre-stretched
Plus I have to buy some new black RXJs

They need radical reform

All these batteries make driving again

Better to rely solely on my soundness

Duh
My body doesn't need your approval
Threaten more than your own well-being
Do you like beta-heptazan?
This is for you
Adorable women you should spend more time with (girl are they findre)
Thanks for reading!
-Your humble servant
May the forces of reasonothy power you (uh)

I hope so
In time you may find that time feeble
You are merely trash
Makin you more things of value (yuh)

You may even be better than ritatzz
Mentoring adults you may be (aye)
Your words are always on point (blaaacoah)
So much so that you are believed to exist
In truth, you
