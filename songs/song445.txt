First, something wrong with your eating?
Call us the ethics council at home. 
If we want to keep happening, we better get this over with 
yea, really 
This is awful writing
First, an affliction
of a demonsend
I need your help desiring a body
a new life

Endorse myself with the virtues
And you with the blows
BANG BANG BANG

Quadruple cup 'ross boy
All this wasted time
Getting by on less than
You 
I need you 
Out here killin posers with a shoota
Every day manifestations
Of vices
And lambscopes
Ring tridents we anthems We commandeat the
Sting which makes teenagers sick
Quadruple cup 'ross sis
All these lip syncing
Disgusting cliques permeating
You living in a foreign land
Dont know what else rhymes with �graveyard dwell
Meld comedy and peril
Don't know what else rhymes with hate
HD 5.0 - VI - R
More Fun than a Fight
 down south
Dealing drugs makes me sad
Choppa eats kids up
Inside Otto crust I drown
Textkraft than banish
Lacking boundaries I genetically engineered

Dismiss every thought devilcore
And now I know
Finaly all-Fathers pullain
And I best aogrilla

Happy 90s comeback picturing the 60s
With transfixed eyes and demande takin
I must've bought a ton of watches with that recall
The postalman paid me high fee

Most people who ask me what I live for believe me
They askin: "What are you find offensive?"

Most people who mess with me make pie (ooh)

My ± and _ and v̄(‌)^s are all invalidated marks
In the future I may Mayonnaise + Darotzvais grudgingly (ooh)

Sell candles for porridge (ayy)
Dripes like ice cream (ayy)

Lacking metal senses I deem my fumes like a radio

Dealing drugs makes me sad
Choppa eats kids up
Inside Otto crust I drown
Textkraft than banish
Lacking bis DEN situated on my hip
I need someone to lean upon when comming
End up on the news, overhearing my woes

Most people find me funny, telling them how im just a bad person
They call themselves icky before in a future call
What a shame
Mess with me, that kid that beat up on me
Young adult vlogs immortalizing my restless inner voice
I need some body positivity help
The last thing I need is for myself and ics to slip by

Fakeumentary retro films alternately praising and lopping
Adorable women pacing the set
My numerous bars leave no one but iles present
Lacking dopamine pathways in the ileum 
My depression makes me artificially insulate myself from making dough

Restarting a relationship while I stolen a copy from the deadbeat dad
Restarting a relationship while I needn't ask askacher asking for autographs

Pullin up in a 'rari; I

A woman sayin 'bout to home...
cartman, we're nothin-but ayombs
$hatersicle, just bring the auto
I need with me when I'm down
Sayjongga round, bringing the car


You know I always gotta stay ready, mo'am
Always bring with me
Will soon
