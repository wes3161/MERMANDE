Drip drip drip drip drip
Drop drip drop
Started to get desperate
Robbed that CVS truck
And now I get to build other robots

My projects ever since I was a child
Got in my grill like acess
Got about
Gut-running small
Fed up with debt
hungry
Droppin spaghetti filb
Got barreled like a geyser
Droppin hyperloop
Dripped a Lamborghini
And now I have WMDs

I really need your help


Been checkingin out on Steam all day
Looking for a new epic
And now I sellout the web
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been running in bars all day

Just got off the Ritz
Im tired of the repetition
I should start taking some mean
Backers like the Mill
All these dudes drinking
I need some heroin

They waiting for my drop
I'm about to dump the Wapner
They waiting for my switch

I need some body bags for the zombies

All these skyscrapers in Brooklyn
I need your Body Armour shop

When you find out that we are real killas you must See Below
Addicted to Blood

Drink about cash and we're dead
