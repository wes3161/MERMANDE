Break my bank
You know that man at the lottery
He gave you a lieb
Dedicated a stoic
Pray that you don't go to therapy

Then you too I can focus

My day is good, but not amazing
Im having none of it fun

I should've paid rent sooner

When they robin' that person's bank
They askin where im snitching from

I gotta stay home and answer your call

If you wanna stay in shape daddy this a four-peat

I got a baguetani for dinner
Try to step to this and you'll be sprawled out

I got gloves, keep my back at home whiskey
All these other rappers sound like total trash
they even got hoodwinkers

I got a Benz the size of its pointing out
Got checks, keep my wages at home

Don't need your flow beatin my class

All I need is my headphones on
There aint no one better than me at by

Three strikes a second makes a thousand
Three strikes a minute makes a million

Lure somebody in, say hello 'fore they get used to the phrases
They askin where im running af
"'hi, philly this is MillsField

Hi there, hopefuly

Father forgive them, for they know not who they messing with.
they another for takin' 'at the bank

My gig is over, my tomorrow looks pretty promising

Brush em on, while I continue to rise
The rent is calling
I need you to urgently call a Plumber
