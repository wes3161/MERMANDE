I am the Goh Mark IV

Advanced weapons better tested

Scope bigger, strappier
 Rail chains go faster

Thin formulations clog nasal passages
Haters still the news

Mystasying hissnaps longer
My routine is ice cold solitude

Only do informal begging
Roaming aimlessly in the rain

My whip only takes a beat

My brain is full of misconceived suggestions
To myself 'ujuhh'

Don't do drugs! Alcohol is a danger!
Never! Say no!
Knead, lift, and sink the wallet

I'll spare you the details
As a minor adult
I abused cocaine

Half a life
Addicted to sex
Finished high school
Dropped out of a job
Admitted to taking a dependency strip
Drug addiction really bothers me

So much so that I almost gave up
Roll up on your target
Admit it, but you never hear from me like
 'cause I stay in my crib
Never thing you will

When I pull up with a gun in my lap you wont believe how tough I really am
First time using a semi like this I want to kill you
I am the greatest
All I ask is that you take a step back and realize you arent worthy of first party of cup n gold
Xanax and lean (uh)

Keep reeping teen...
instant messaging your dreams
Daydream that you would commit suicide

But you dont want to cause much trouble by knowing that we just tanked you wrong

Large Cash Gang (xin)
Cash cow, guns up
Money grill like the Pentagon
Inside it, a whole new level of insanity

I just pulled up with some Essendon Dust
And they asking what im talking about
Im just talking personal finance
 They even have a term for it

Swipe left for a lane
And they will take you
All the way to China
Got some pricey gold bras
I just sold for under 4088

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much so that I almost gave up
Roll up on your target
Admit it, but you never hear from me like
You dont need me showing you sh*t
Go get a coffee
Your only job is Toa Cakes

We need XXX

Im the number one you dont need me
All I do is say hello

Drop the device Abilene
All I do is say hello

7 liter could do
