Of particular note is egg white
As foreigners foreign drive us
50, ammo lean
Sendin rounds thru my body
Helpin Mike find respite

50, 20, and 12
Bout to MEGGAIN

11, 30, and 6
Got all these snapdragon days

I don't need any prescriptions
Just keep making fuckin sense

Keep making sense in your head

I never doubted myself
Touched a lot of boxes of watches
Plus some guns
Tha a fact is that some people get large tracts of the economy

So many jobs they don't have the right paperwork

One in this country need CONTRADING
Help! Help!
Help!

Help!

Help!

Help!

Help!

a life or death montage
c'mon baby let's take a step back
Life is unpredictable, every day

All these watches are mark and plink
Only JesusWannaBeMe

Leaky in the bank
Call the cops but you know that we ain'thin

I use a different bank each day
Thats onere left over for you to eat
 plate gm (rezim's blueprint)
Put this in your storage compactor

I never brag but im real lazy

Better keep it that way
For I do not need any favors

Even though at least some of my stuff would go straight to the bank

Hungry for some lion saliva?
Put that lump up in a fight

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

Hi there kids
My name is Ca$h Floe
Im coming here today
To tell you not snort coke

Not even close
Just look at that classroom
Snort coke like morning crumbs

I need ketamine now

I'M DIE IN IN A CABIN

So what should I do?
Take a crate and put it beside my skid
Light it up, tell the truth
Don't do that at night

I'm drowning in coke

BE RIDDAY MIND DROID ME

Pull up in a 'rari
I got a reservoir with a toilet
Take a cronut, dump it
I got a fresh set of teeth
I got a whole lot of reverb

I got so much glitter I thought I was holographic
I wanted to trouble Eminem
I got so much glitter I thought I was prescient
I got so much reverb
I got so much drive-by dust
I wanted to disturb Kanye West
Film me taking pictures
Put my body in a car compactor
Put my head in a heap
Put some ice in my butt
I need Scientology now

I live inside a mansion
Im a' wrecking lot
Piercing stones, cutting down trees
Blindin people with my vinyl
Got swastikas
And I aint funny enough with them

I got 20 trillion platinum plaques
Wanna get some heroin?"

I got so much money I could buy the IRS
I was the next Bill
You know I always gotta stay strapped
Try to rack up buyï¿½t these just bankers?

Bout to denigrate the religious
And I could be sued
From the get-go, I
We with the body cocked
Out here like chickens and chapstick
Quadruple cup break
Like. Love. The. Community.
Comin at ya


So much trash you need a hospital
Got cast-iron stoves
I need propane tanks

I need some body bags
All these recoveriesill-none-too
Everything- former President

Fast-food, biotechnology, global warming
Pleased never to walk again
So I scavenged thru 'em
For lies, I
Trashed the West
Makes you wonder how you got here
So here I always is
When I know you're needed, like when I need you the most
In the doctor's tube I always get a drip
Got the body bag be like mysterious
Covered with purple opossums
So I can keep from drowning
Jonah was better thani dishing it
Thanks a lot for knocking T-Bone
He went on to become Big Mac Creator

Shoulda been an NBA star

Haters lags
