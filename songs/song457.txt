← Why christopher choppins hate netroots :]
They callin rap God 
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I been selling cocaine since I was
20
Got it better than a lotta soup

Once again gang gang
There are more gangsters in the galaxy than at any time in history
Your cruise ship is a WHOLE far greater than its crew
I couldcode any number of languages
From Cebu to Pina Floe
I live inside a DAPP!

I’ll clear you out like a four-course porridge
Sendin heavy flavors like performance soya sauce
I’ll really shape you (uh)
Until you become super cool
Like Pep Tump Iz write, makin tape
I have a lookin long lie, since I've been photographing
 some of my more private(er)acquires
such as emigrating to the U.S.

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)

Pull up, spray the club
Strip it up in the ring
Got them clean come trophies

I’m affable, unreasonably polite
They even bring the clocks back

Lifestyle trackers absolutley accurate
My bed is so made to sleep that I can hardly move
We're mental breakdowns at times
This keeps me up at night
Lacking interests at all times

So when you see me cruisin down the street
Pull up, spray the elevator
Zap in the supermodels dreams
I’m so full of shit that I can't put a lie
I keep asking myself "why amotobacco so bad?"

Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you may come up with some much-loved compositions
Go in choppa blazin up front
Trippin on some joints you ain't never been
Resturant bill go up in smoke (ayy)

On the run from the law I’m out cold now
My clutches are full with cash bars (ayy)
If you want to fight, go in peace

I’m the hardest worker I know
Got a lot of bombs like lunatic
I have at least a half a body
In bars and restaurants all over the place

When I bring the pain of prohibition with me
The only person who won't pull a fast one
Is me []I am much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much, much more
This violence doesn‏t need any reeducation
I am strong and ready to rock
In this day and age of cellphones, Venmo, and the like
I am told we humans are so cruel that we don‏t need technology
 to make us what we are
We humans make of aluminum, steel, and some stuff
So much more dangerous than drugs at best
I consume way more protein than every single person I know
I become drip fed and drastically reduce my intake of fiber

I now look like an iced latte

I have been linked to numerous car accidents
I have to be more than just a random dream
Now that I think about it, if I were you I would kill myself sooner

Cause while I am breathing down my neck I swear I'm gonna slip

With each passing day just the sound of my every syllable

If I were a commodity what I was selling would not offend

Do you really think that an adolescent would still want to spend time with his/her grandmother?

I tell you, joke it, shoelaces are conical?

While I am still afloat my addiction to illegal drugs means my only hope of survival is on myself

My erratic day-to-day existence is causing me enormous pain

While I am taking pain medications I oddly find myself without
At times I find myself in the clear
While I do not need any psychoactive substances at all
While I do not need any alcohol whatsoever
While I must constantly remind myself not to be disturbed

I consume far more protein than any other food on the face of the Earth

When I look at myself in the mirror I realize that I am a total fucking mam
I have already raised
