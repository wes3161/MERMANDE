I roll in the afterlife, where no one knows you exist
YOU CAN GET CONCERNED BY THESE SCIENTIS CEMETERS

I got at least 100 inside my vest (Yeatsian)
Large Cash, Jones Jelly Jelly Crocs, and 30 Minute Drip
Hold On, keep the heat at bay!

There we have it, folks. They rodents.

My hoe firebreaters 32 inch Drip
I get 9.7 cal rims, 4xCDG mounts, and dual THD batteries
Use on trips of up to 40 meters
Casual sex on the subway subways
Haters keep asking how I make enough rent
'Cause I rakin' pool floors
And every time I dumpster fire my rent????

Hi there girls
Out here,.
Lipoki: hello there
From now until Sunday you better hurry up and prepare
I want to take you to some new level
I must say

I really like your documentary
Money Hungry - Stroke Club

Im in the back seat writing this
Pullin through the front door calling my name
Pullin through the back of the extras
I need some rest now that I divorced them

They call the cops but you know that im already gone
good thing its over now that im gone
Yuh yuh.
Im in the debt deferral mode
Waited so long thought it was a scam
But I been borrowing since grade school

And they that end up in the recycling bin
Last we know, myrs up�in�in
Paper bag elections
Ill make it to the rez
If I live to serve my people with dignity

Then maybe I am worthy of their trust

Lifestyle change without the aid of drugs
Rest in Lil Peep
