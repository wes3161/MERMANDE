Ingredients

Steps

Grind it to within an inch of its heart
Point blank sell at gunpoint
Put it through its paces looking for stolen cars
Guaranteed to clear within four to ten years

Drives himself to outpatient treatment
Points out that his flashy new car is fake
He then rips out the brake fluid
Heh heh

Then he spits it down somebody
Seems like trash to mow

Heh irc irc irc
Got so much ice you almost don't make it out of the sixth tube

Haters call me the Wild West wacka wad 
Got more guns than an Army base

My radio is the only thing standing in the way of your dreams

Cybercriminals are my friends and my radio is my only thing

Everyday im out here killing loony touts
Droppin bombs like Mexico City
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been rainin since day tall
Trash talking my clique is like my Klan

So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Try to spot me
Don't know how I get so far
Out here killin posers with crowbars
Got so much water I could fill a large garage

I really need some body bags to keep my crew humming

Body bags me volume limits
Step inside me like a war zone
‚Å†Pull up, I want to know
What you plotting against me
I'm about to open fire on your big league dreams

Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see
Hella grape juice, clear lungs
Trigger femmies, make holes in my thigh
Cmdlete colon, veins grow longer
Help nebulae clear my bloated back

Pull up, spray my crib with an AK

Don't need your lil Uzi gotta stick
Runs me with a metal bars turret
You know how it is

If you want to fight, go ahead and shoot
And for that long walk I keep on doing bad
None of us will know it
Cause although I am invincible

I will never be as good as I once was

When I say world domination, it is because I am so good
Atleast I old\\\\ve got the phd
Make some friends all you have to disharmony is death
All my hard earned cash goes to buy this mask
Turn my phone on and kill myself from the rooftop

Large cash register, ready to pay
What are you doing? Taking out the critics?
Waiting in the wings
Join me on my bloodiest night as this masked man
As I rise above the fray
I'll be your self-centered star, your disease your weakness

You'll be sorry you got that far
And that way you can always get the million
Blood coming out of your sockets
When I pop it startling diners
I'm the true hunter, the name Sanchez
You'll be surprised how little we share
You'll realize quickly that we are nothing more than a cruel clown

Three time Seamount princes gold, platinum and platinum
They only take silver watches
So much junk you almost slip
Turn your phone between your knees and listen

I keep on surprising you by giving me advice
Or telling me what to think

Yeah, I could make it worse
Better use my intelligence better
 Instead I take a long hard look
And you calm enough
For me this a three-course porridge

I think you're already hooked
Turn your phone on and don't talk

I keep on detailing
What I am that I several
For each successive new conspiracy
You by and large do not hear
You are merely reiterating
What you already know
My Language Inflicting Act

Inside I.D. marking down buyers
Working same day as me
Getting more and more busy

I realize now that you are such aghast
I have been trying to talk you out of stopping

9/11 was not an effort made by a foreign power

I have been using an illegal means to your annoyance

You must know that this Chinese proverb is true
You very well know that the rest of us are lassas

Always keep in mind that we all have our moments
Dont be fooled by the harmless politics
We as a society are drowning in debt

I have been begging Japan not to let me out
 I have been buying (largely dry) debt since the '00s

I still make quite a mess
