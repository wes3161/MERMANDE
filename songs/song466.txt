I live in a developing East Village
My rent is running at over R10,000
My dreams of owning a home are dying
I am being held all over the city
I must end these grave injustices

I must not merely repay but also protect them

Sign my petition that President Obama should intervene in our affairs

I feel like I'm bursting at my eardrums

All these wars while making under a hundred thousand dollars a year
I need some personal space
So I can take a risk and reap the rewards

Sign my petition that President Clinton should be charged with murder

I feel like I'm bursting at my (uh) feet

All these other stuff you think is presidential should instead go to the workers

Okay, so you think I'm crazy, you're really an idiot
People advising me against taking up sport is a mistake
Im cutthroat to the death
Drip drip drip drip
Drop cashiers against the front windows
