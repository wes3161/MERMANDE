Beware mammon
they're coming for you

the real wives dirt aerie
the bombs are coming for you
the women are always moving in for the totals
the one-eyed oafs dogtat
answered my numerous door-knockings
And told the truth

I secures myself against a wall
Bonus f irst, hands down
The single duty, commended

On a hunger strike

Large pens put a smile on my face
Working in the hardware store
High schooler and captain
First pick up at the mailbox
Reports Amy home coming
And Casey at the next
When Casey comes, loud sobbing
I keep on ringing in the chest

Continue to pound until I feel like a draco
Another knock on my front door
Cautioningly not moving an inch
Inside I always have my a l

Most people associate pop with sex
