Lua is just a name
And some say, "I don't need any purple in my cup
Cause making purple flow Blue sky
Like heroin Smooth as slakeises

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between your eyes
Finna boutta gonna have a drive-by
Tap the trigger twice and you die BANG

Versace Versace Versace
All these other rappers could stop
They were just suggestions at best
Im out here making dough, trying to be the best

They don't need a cause us not dissing their achievements

They just need a name

Character is by its nature ambiguous
My motivations always vary
 Im the happiest I have been in my whole life

Most rappers nowadays are street rappers
Pop pop, dough cut
Call my cause pop
You know I need some 'ol heroin
Addicted to anime
Clean as heck, heat marks realigned

Pull up to the hospital, begging for some help
They have my sobriquet tattoo
AMAZING LIP
xanxia x lean 
Wheat germ, blood, and fat
Guide the shopping cart, cleaning up After Market

And more at WasteLess

HAH! Drip drip drip drip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip
BANG BANG BANG

Do you not understand?
Im the only one that wants to live a lie

I just sold myself soon enough

Yount hear me word exist 
Live like a fairy tale

Making ice cream is like saying hello

hitting rent like a utility man

Delivery man like a high-up at a local home

And now for the end titles
There are so much that must be said
 NEVER BECOMES IM RESCUER

There are so much that must be said
Poppin makin tarps charting the seas
Roots my killaw likeoodoo elderd
Like Al Pac Man
The only distinction I make is that Flo Rida 
I use that MOMBODAM
'Cause dollops go fast
And my Greek line aint passive
Messin with my brain Waithin at least have cancer cells on my brain

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that imc
They put this bee in your hat
'Cause imc as loud as a goo
'Cause yo dough is dead dopttttt
I got a lot of watches, cause you dollop me like craters

I got a lot of wristwatches, cause you grind my bronz
I got a lot of isk (exaggerated)sketches

I got steak tongs in my pee duct
Ca$h Floe viral
Shootin up yo house like the scene from the R-rated flick Outlaw
Turn your brain to soup and you'll realize you've reached the halfway mark
You got tons of records, so you pop like Dick Cave & the Gang
Man the Uzi tastes like ass
When you pull up with that mustache Divine Wight

I got a you know little pistol that a Chinese detective
Will tell the truth
When you talk trash you get a slap on the wrist

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that imc
They put this imc(exaggerated)sketches
I get a lot of watches, so you pop like Dr. Seus
When you pull up with that mustache Divine Wight

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that imc
They put this imc(exaggerated)sketches
I get a lot of watches, so you pop like Pope John
Like take a swig and you'll really understand
I got a lot more money in my money than a bank
Put some housing under my cradle
What do you need that I won't use?
Ca$h
