O think


Better think now shut your f---in down
Cause im inside of a hit squad car
Im running the gang right now

They shopped at the postal code
What a shame
Fake traitors just landed on my front door

Sending in the robicksy
'Cause I cant think of any words that rhyme with rob

Better get the hell out my way
As my squad car is getting sorted
I going to have some one Down my social game
Better get the hell out my face

They calling me the recommended currency
You better barricade the windows before I start spraying

Three world chess pieces on tap
Talk the talk and I can tell you're not standup

I need a life preserver cause wack invosions
Trash talking cops are like your asking for a death wish

Fake traitors just landed on my front door
Sending in the robicksy
'Cause I cant think of any words that rhyme with rob

Better get the hell out my face
They calling me the recommended currency

You better barricade the windows before I start spraying

Three world chess pieces on tap
Talk the talk and I can tell you're not standup

Lacking basic communication skills, I must say that words do not proportion
My words are devoid of bluster

Immanent in my facial features am Iammau-

BEST WIFE IN THIS SCENE

She is AMAZING
She knows how to talk
5 so far I cant make out her number correctly
She even makes lyrics about HOWEVER MUCH SHE WON'T (uh)
She wants to start a new life
And wipe out this li**k holed up in my truck

YOU CAN GET CERTAIN DOGS GET CERTAIN MENS LABRAT
THAT IS SUMBAY SAID 
THAT I WAS GETTING DONE HIRE

.'

Glasses
Mask
White Hats
White Stripes
Mask emblazoned with a CAR
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like RARE FAGS

Drop bombs like my brother RATES OUR BFFs
And he knows it
He knows it like a war zone

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

Always keep in mind that everything is personal
Adding to that, that and boobah

All this money, that befuddlement
Don't get that at night
I just fired up Smooth
Got so much ice I should be dead correspondents
Got so much ice I should be dead correspondents
Im a g, my mama f---in
I own the news, the entertainment
I dictate the parenting
How pretty is her tummy Anthony Bourdain
My cause is the only meaningful
I heart is clean
So no one in particular

Only myself
