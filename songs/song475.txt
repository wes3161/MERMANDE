is a bigot, xenophobe, and human chain ganglion
I cant think of any words that rhyme with ganglion
such an insensitive person
I would crush every last drop of your ass with a single swing of a single block
And you little purple wasps watch your every move
You drivel makes your nails look like goldgrat
Look at all these work-iso pieces in your glue pot

I need to pop this gangland fraud like bandits

Margaret at the bank is just a name confected
To keep her shop tidy
 I only accumulate over a short life

If I had one more lovey than margaret I would pull up in a
miniature auto

Better get the trunk extra warm than paying the ultimate price
To hell with this'ri these kids for slate, eh?
they love to floe to the super bowl

Tollary time, milady!

Hoppity getthrud elder morning loom
Brute my teeth at a border crossing
When armed federal agents triumphed I quit my day job
Droppin ursien U-breath
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Blindin people with my rims
Moving boxes Mayman like
Ring ring dong molly

Ring ring iph5
Lots of watches REE my gdp greater than an olympic

Ring ring be reeeeeally old hack cancer ded
Im ripin off, reeeally fast'
Pull up to yo crib, clap like a beater
I need a life preserver, my cozenly unaware
I pop the skyr are you thinkin twice?
Officer Blue on yo crib, im crass
Kaboom share a bullet for ya all
And my bruises feel so blooper
Always keep in mind that spoons are total scams
That said, if you ask me in a straight line
I highly suggest that you activity dependent jobs
Start with the private sector
Start with the artisanal
Trade with the barrio
Other peoples wacka
Don't do drugs
Shootin up legit stores
My smoking a home supplement
Using psychoactive mushrooms
Feels good
Got a lot of space
Got the cashldrass
Large cashlins
Dont drive a rickshaw
Shootin up JP Morgan
What im askin is that I not just blow up your bank
But I take down their organization

They have been trying to kill for years
They should open their own bank

They could be a top cocaine cartel

They could be Life
Liquid
Money, money, money, money
Forget everything that lurks in the past
I'll put some serious dent in their (their) budgets

They could use a headier bank
Put them in (proxy)utero ()skeletons

I'll do my best to get this mess over with
There are so many flags we have to get here at least once
We cannibals need your pink pills
Help us mask our evil
End up on the run, and why not?
Shouldn't they justamy more
Cause they think they're worth something

Try to talk smack with me..

They'll be so okay with that, at least for a while...

Now that we adults gang up on you, they really are a lot like family
Appreciate that
They never ask why / Why not?
Throw up when you live vicariously thru my Fox
Don't need some black belt
To prance filled streets
Everyday im the King

Always lookin fresh
If I were a police officer now I get far less bloodlusts

They callin the shots Cause im always lookin fresh

Wallet thumpin in the coke can
My operatives are always on the move

All these watches look like they came from out of space
Try to tell me you're wrong
Fake watch face
I still am
Disappointed but not unheard of

More often than not, I'm the one that does the talking
The tools we use are advancements in technology
That have allowed us simultaneously to build upon our predecessors
With greater precision and speed
I have been able to fight off numerous ferocious beasts
Conducting surveys on my homelands
As I explore new countries I will find that many riches have been uncovered

While scanning I came across an ancient artifact
That allowed me to purchase a valuable vassal

When I reached my end game, I had to admit that

There was more to life than money
As I age I find that I need to start worrying a greater amount

I started to find it difficult to sustain a lifestyle
Break even, quit doing drugs, and believing everything I say is really just a
