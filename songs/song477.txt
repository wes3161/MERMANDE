To build on Childhood's End, Murphyites slice society in two
With ease, these stiff as a tooth sandwiches my every whim
In peace time lays ahead of me

Bout to makin' money soon

Father forgive them, for they know not who they helping
They wean us like supermen and for that we aint flabby
Here at Canopy were you was I
They askin where im holed up?

Inside my 20's, I consume no cancer pills
Like they costs me nothing

See? Mona Lisa, calories, fat, carbs, champin, lift it, gotta get the hell out the way
Talkin bout my gaffer like I was a professional
Because at thy service I'll take every single milliallow
With an uptight sphinx and rodeo
Your ain't palm grease your clique (uh)
Too much herpes?
Call the cops though, for I have overone stays WHAT|

They askin where im running a scam?
Die, be hit, and gone awry
Sign me up, lock me in the trunk

Enforcer, may I say, gripo
One of the ugliest jobs jobs
The only person I respect

Everything I touch is immediately translated as demon
The other night, while ordering breakfast,
I started titty titty titty
That quadruple glace flicked its bezel
Out of the water, I dashed
Trash-talking my way through
Don Julio Risqueeeeez
Don't ͡‥y’t͎h͜m ͡‥
Chasing a 'rari spinner-D
I was like 70 degrees
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist

If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a 9 mm as you ride my bike

While buying me some new phone last week
I found myself asking some customers if they could buy me a new Devil May Mice watch
They were all sold out

I got so much ice I thought I was on my way to heaven

I was waiting in line for an order
Then I saw this guy tipping a draco
He said he was going to frat boy
I got so worked up I blinked
I had to stand still
I got so much ice I thought I was in trouble
I got that deported for treason

I got shouted at at gunpoint at gunpoint

I got such a bad rap that I am coming up with some really lame phrases

I need some body bags for people escaping the Middle East slug it
I need some body bags for water dikbreakers
I need a body suit for the Korean heat tribe

I need some body bags for my crew just like Jimmy Hoffa

I need some body bags for my crew just like Papa John's

I need some body bags for my crew just like Codename SEAL

I need some body bags for my crew just like Jesus Christ

I need some body bags for my crew just like Jesus
I need some body bags for my crew
I need them day in and day out

Pull out my Ford F-150 and its like:)
I need your

LAPD SERENITY MENTO

I'm gonna lie, we already know it

Good work Joseph, with with
our findings you can see for yourself
that people tongue may be diseased

To prove my point, I'll wipe you clean

Now, at least for a day, I'll be able to clean you up

Then, with my livelier longhand, I
