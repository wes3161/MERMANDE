Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a rainstorm

The other day at a party a female companion of mine purchased a gun and began selling it out the window.
 
For lack of a better word, a 'trashcan
As the name suggests
I carry a loaded .44 Magnum
And with my gear on
There is no tomorrow
Glad you asked
Got a lot of it
In case you are hungry

Got a like a (large)
Got a for boy
Kids and young adults

So much packed power
That there is a need
For us non-businessies

We Anonymous WERE Allwreet

Like home-grown terrorists

We all thought so
Thats why we carried so
Large Sticks
