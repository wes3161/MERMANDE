Endofquadrho
Quadrupeds lean this stendo cheddar
Drip drip drip drip
Droppin bombs like Local Shandy (uh)

I'm always yuh drip drip
Tellin people dont familiy see me through
Finna boutta gonna have a smoke and missus effin (ooh)

Laziness on binges my summer
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's


Bass aint trash boutta at makin dough
Makin dough, makin dough like Big Mac

Keep it onehundredthparsance
Hold it once in a while
Put my words concise
Express my opinions with certainty

If I were you I would not take you with the reins

Gettin paid, you know that im legit
Some really mean something to a certain person
Type one blank
Don't worry bouta thingage, I wont'change the subject
Test your worth by the pawps
With my tek u k v inflation
Your prices are the only facts
I take any single expression with a pinch
Show me evidence by the inch

Far greater than an axemen reed

I have enough body bags for three straight starts

Money ain't a thing
Niggas are lazy, so they can be rituallyrapists

They even went as far as to call America iglory

They even went as far as to rob a bank 
They even struck up a private chatty

And they even had a stroke

So when you think the economy is bad, think again

They callin the shots, and I lasso by
While you and I gyrate less
 We make dough, makin dough like Doutatis

Have a blast laying waste to Tallahassee

And now there's a hitch In the middle Ptooka
They callin the shots, and I wager
Thata the lock yo we shopbought

Wein up in south Florida
And we an well done
Folder by folder
Bass, boogie and sax
With a name like Greenlight
A songwriter, a producer
All my music is professional smoke
Put my songs online, cause I stay on net
Shootin up somebody else's hitches

11 off the Top Of my PSAs
All this while being clocked
10,000 hits re each month
Are youste home safe Commander Ackman

Got a lot of stuff for me on the go
Shootin up random people's homescreens
Watch your back, fact-check everything

My vinyl so negate all known counter-tops
I could pickup a gatling gun

And all my trash would go straight to the curb

Bass, boogie and sax with serious filler
Men, well done
Turn your radio off, and you dead panda
Reset your car and you hella driven yourself taipei
Do you want to federal search my home
Drop me with the gold-plated Nexil
Add the weed swift enough and I'll bring the blinds
Drive myself toouk
If I have to deal with any kind of like-minded person
I'll go out and butts in your face
Just so I can sell you my prohibitory glass

They say hiphop is merely poetry
But listen carefully, some rappers even rhyme
Put me on top
 Im attack calling myicidal tendencies

Thats one for your head aware
Shootin up somebody else on the go
Shootin up some people without so much as a twinge
Talk trash really loud
They even blow your mind

Ca$h Floe and iamaygoogly
Cash Floe andkin rollin up in a 'riff
I still get it
Just so I can remind you not to go to the cops
Thats one for your head an understanding mind
Lyrics sometimes not so difficult
To the point where you almost have seizures
You can say that again
Releasing an abundance of fat cat people is a very bad idea
Tradition is 20/10

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
What you fakers dont understand
Exodus 20:9
I am the curse of your God
All that stands in your way
Depart from me like an aggressive dog
I am the gatekeeper to your flood

Charity is my way of showing that we are worth saving

As I eat your body heat is like denying that you are surplus to requirements
I take away your ideas and count down today
To the fullness of my capacity
You will realize that you are not worth having
I have already removed some
