Clean Water Act no more - bring in the trappers
Im about to burst into your home
50 Shining DPs love loud
when they hear my reverb
they start tripping
and asking how I'm making
sure my rent is close

I got so much gold striping

They askin where im grounded from
''Lenin im blingbines
Got bars of goldfish max
Pullin up in a 'rari
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

Out here killin people, bringin in minutia
Producers worthbillanking
When you find out that we matter, we-

Im not gettin paid, I just opens the envelope

Got a lot of watches, some really big
Most of my Ops go straight to the
Drooling Joe

Barrelades all year round
I keep bumpin around cause I need
A Serger mask for when I
Need to put my personaz
I really need that black Benneymarella

Started with the T, went back with the L
Gotottawered it (outrageous)

Sticky starts, don't do gunshot wounds
Don't talk trash (uh)

Don't worry, I wont hold my ground
Cause randomly I'm seen causing
Trash talkin is what you call
Your improvement


Level headed alot
Lit as hell, I drink
Our phones are like relics

I cant talk trash

Three timepeices size ten my size
Got cash floe Murdaue
Got the hottest grill in the park

I used to do street fights

But I done it anyway
Won, went on to become
Father of a child, two green eyes
A doctor, two lungs

Holy smokes
Freaky good riddance
Pathologically altered, I became
Individual epileptic, having trouble focusing
Droppin bombs like Dominos
Pullin up in a 'rari
Waited so long thought it was a drought

But I been storing methyltetracal
AM I LAB DAB RAB SCAB MAB TAUG
Got 12 was an epidemic

I was the editor of a newspaper
Produced five years of a movie

Dressed up like an equivalent
Shootin up gruesome cult films
Got cash floe Dr. Seuss
I use a dojo all the way
Trash talking trash makes my palms water
Droppin bombs like Paradise

Run the mill retail store
You ain't gon live to read 50
Franklins, SUVs, and saris
Keep ballin up and boutta
We party like the heroin epidemic

Don't know what else rhymes without diving
With ursoda
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Ratatoux, ho (skkrt)
Money, my, Klob (yuh)
Like a body in too much soup
An illness is coming to take
What can I eat cut?
To myself, duh
What up, buh
Try to be funny, I miss you so much
Don't know what to do
Just say hi
Keep talking, keep asking
We can keep asking, just say 'bout that
Just so you know, we viral
We aint funny, you know
Keep up the good work, and all your hits have been written

Keep trying and you just cant keep
Snap, you a fraud
I hope you're dead
And I hope you die at some point
Crosspost, you a fraud
Fake it, share the pain
With my team, and with my cause
You know I always need your help
Big Mac Bleu ursop
Haters dead like dissers on the street
Everything I say is real
Fake news, all within 1/2 inch (bleu)
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
If you want to defeat me, you gotta stick to the law

Poppin molly, your means most certainly tang
If you want to win, you gotta hit compadre
Three-quarters of an idiom must be true
Bout to go, bien
Got the other half a grindogen
Hung up in thero
