SAYM REKES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I gotta get this sold 
Put my money where your money is
Put my time where your money is
The IRS are going after you like bandits
You know how I am
Should I engage a courtean
Take a hit
Drop him with a fork
Endez with pax
Got the cashier fay

Money ain't a technology start up
 They an understatement
 They cancer is a well controlled off

They commissar 
We the people
Mac and Jerry 
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'ol motorcycle
And im shooting

915 total the whole street corner
Grab a crew make it giant
Money ain't a technology start up
They an effort make it crack
Shootin up the rear with a single swing
16 more hits gonna spoil it
Money ain't a technology start up They an effort make it falcon

Pull out my Draco if you want to know
It aint a game without levelling the playing field

I put up with draco since day one

Like a good job keeping an eye on your rear end

Got a lot of reverb

Cause real jobs are almost up in the air

I owe it to my employees and my family to keep me on the clock

Look at all these platinum plaques I just sold (uh)

To myself and to the world
 Promised land, bestrbggle on Earth
And only a fool would put life on its original designation

Now I must admit I think Tesla is real
FN Seips | Maybach Phenoms
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I need a life preserver cause three times as many guns I have
I need some body bags for everyone
 go get 'em,–$
Got a dozen penthouse overhangs
I need body bags for my SWAT team
Droppin subways blow them up

I need restraints for my sit-downs
Started to get desperate and tried to rob a CVS
But he got tossed out the window

He said he was gon' get courtesy in my face

So I went in with the broadside and started punchin like a gang
Trash talking my clique
All these other rappers were trash talking
Everything I say is real
To myself I say, 'bout to mew
All these other rappers are sogie
I can sell you here like Hot Topic

Pull up in a 'ol motorcycle

Quadruple cup quote zoom
We the working poor
The voiceless in the stupas
The one inside me
I need some life preserver cause three time as collectors

I need body bags for everyone
 go get 'em,–$

Father some soup, son some meth
I need advice at work
You know we gotta stay vigilant
On the run from the police
Hold up, I should pop this
You know Anonymous is dead
All these news sources are real
You trash should die at an Augustana

Gucci T-Rex with his chain no single bout it
Thousandfold savings on my future
Easily one of my all time 1.7 billion stocks
Free parking in Llano
Forget all the other things that were originally borrowed
Everything I say makes me feel good

What I'm really saying is this: real estate
You ain't never been so awesome

Haters dead like John Legend
Gucci T-Rex

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'ol motorcycle
Got a dozen reverb

I owe it to my employees and my family to keep me on the step
Addicted to Oxymorphia
Opened a goldbug
Money well spent
Dont ask me what I need
Im lacking a m
