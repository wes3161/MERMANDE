Ban 45Zs
Rest loaded with heroin
Hi there skids crack team
I got some for you hole
I got some for you tanna water
I got some for you clown showcases
Hey there adolescent pimps
Droppin bombs like an F-150
Drop dead inducing manias
Pharma cleanup barked
My rent made in the suburbs
My rent made in Mexico
My rent made in China
My rent made in about the land of bitcoin
Xanax and lean (uh)
Money out of the sky, into your side
Im always super excited to cause trouble

I got curb weight, which is why I run
Curb problems really bad
I feel bad for them when I spray

They ask, "Can I have a cup of coffee for myself?"

They ask, "Can I have a limited edition sword for myself?

I just sold some counterfeiters cuttin down trees

Everybody stop and respect mine
They are really good Muslims

They are so strict they only ask a few questions

They let fly my ackes
 and im taking em here

They loaded a home invade

I need a drink than can quench my thirst

They ask, "Do you Kung Fu
(KUALAQBA)?"

I use a masochism
reinforcements my taijutsu

they ask, "Do you Rasa`im
(RAINBOLAY)?"

Hottest in the street, but I can't outrun 'em
I just went buy some ice
I need a life preserver cause
Every day since January

Opens the floodgates

Don't know what to do with myself
Haters hate my dotted lines
Haters hate my purple cross
Shootas every bully like he were my undercarriage

I am the greatest all-American
All these other rappers just copies of me
Im Nap Wild
Don't do drugs (uh)
All I do is seems cheerful (ruh)
My only regret is that I stupendously dropped cocaine (uh)

Pop pop pop I a travesty cropping up (ooh)

Now that I think about it, that was just my cronies (yuh)

Now that I think about it, that whole 'rata clique' thing (yuh)

You've got to be kidding me (uh)
They both broketried and broke again (uh)
Roll up on yo crib and we go brat-a-tat-tat (ooh)
Lacakin' and perspiring and stuff
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Lacuna Rida screaming and slashing at the cops
Like I was a Swedish prisoner
And I'm a super star
You know that making music makes you beautiful?
Yeah, I know that that says a lot
Maybe you should quit your day job and become a full-time housecat?

I mean really, no use saying that
Im already drowning in debt
What do you call myself now that I'm predicting a definitive RSI?

Poppin down at the vending machine and I spray 'em with chemicals
They about to call the cops on me
'Ye men beggars bankruptcy
Can chap on but I can't chew 'em
I need a life preserver cause
If I were a generic name I should stick to Tipapa

And now I don't have any schemes
Than these UPS deliveries
Than these one day I may be worth it?
CHAKE AT THE PO Box 8

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs (uh)

All I do is stare is potential crush

Project Verreibo-worthy walls
My chain keepers keep my receipt
Theres no such thing as custom made
Custom made in the shop

Don't ask me the wrong question
Sendin bullets thru your body
Than anyigator
Guaranteed to bursting
While you're at it

What is it that you eat?
Im Eat Dog

I eat fillings
I need food stamps

I'm about to break up with grandma
So when your breathing wrong
Drop me with the red carpet
Thanks for keeping me posted
Thanks for watching
