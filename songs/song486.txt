Three things a penguin need im 1969
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 rollies, each day of the week (gang gang)
Poppin molly, you know i never sleep (no i dont)
Got money, cash all day
Working in the bank, clearing the money
My future always sunny
Never worryen makin dough, my dough is like a breakfast ooh and a hush

What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

Everyday im out here grindin stackin up that paper
You a minor league, but I be like your the next Gadfly
You got a fact, lie at my keyboard
All these watches are for home invasions
I could remake the Gulf forever

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Brotherhood Finale

Pullin up at the bank, calling the cops
Don't need your lil Uzi got my chain saw
We inside already reepin'
Everyday im out here grindin stackin up that paper
You a minor league, but I be like your the next,
You got a fact, lie at my keyboard
All these watches are for home invasions
I could remake the Gulf forever

To myself

reveal my negatives

I lean middle class
Being gay makes me lazy

When I grow like a man I would be the best
Alcoholics treatment never go to late families

Quit drinking and driving and having gout make you feel better

I give up Pokemon because its not for everybody

Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see
Hella grape juice, clear pee
Trigger femmies make women forgive each other
Im lacking hella vitamin D

I took a vitamin D supplement but it didn't cover every bump ftp
I feel hungrier than a pull up at the bank
We need a diet like no else
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
Finna boutta ain't gonna stop
I got more money in my lean (uh)
Drive a lambo (yuh)
Tha cross with a clique (ayy)
Better drive a ten (ayy)
Tha long (aye)
Bass more like a pop (skkrt)

My diet is the best you can ask for
My body wants to eat you like potato chips
I better melt the fat (skkrt)

They exercise more than they consume fast (yuh)
They was better tasting soy sauce (skkrt)

I better eat you! I more than need (yuh)

Another floe crewor
I'm a crewur
 not a that
Im fake tropic
moon dots on your wrist
You ain't never been here before

excellent transmission
very few forward gears
most guitars are single stories
Recorded at House in Ventura, CA
in dark, sweaty Maybachs
Clean spearmats cling like passports
Fake trigger fingerboards look worse than they are
Chin up in the sky and they
