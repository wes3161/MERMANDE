You can keep doing what you are
You can be considered Prophet (ziayy)

Waited so long thought it was snowing but it really is ._.
AMAZING SPIRITS

Im finishing Mafia II
So yeah, I drink milkshakes straight from a gunslinger

Like Batman

They say life is a subjective experience
Only a fool would take taking drugs seriously

You wont see any of my cheese on the street

They say strip clubs are bars full of sex
You better barricade your windows before I start makin money like
PLEASE TAKE A MIPE
I’ll clear you out like a four-course porridge

I keep on sayin ca$hkoing door-knockin

Callin chest compressions drip
Your brain is drowning
Ca$h Krokasu
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I’m ludicrously high for chief rabbi cause
I have enough money to buy the Dow Jones Industrial Average
and I'm the only one who knows what im talking bout
THAT'S LABY DOW JEAYY MILLION

Pullin up in that spaceship
Cause I need my personal space characterized
With question after question of what im doing in my head

So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Lipity loppity kitten over there (hygiene number 1)
Do you like my dark purple?
Try to be professional
I’m ludicrously high for chief rabbi cause
I have enough money to buy the Dow Jones Industrial Average
and I’m the only one who knows what im talking bout
THAT'S LABY DOW JEAYY MILLION

Another week, another fake bank report
Another fake fake mortgage
I keep on calling but im not really heard
Another time or another another fake
Fake again
You better make it to jury pool where we start
Sooner or later, I'll slip up

Call the cops, knock on their front door
Tell them you aint growin happy cause i just found
Your call is my No. 1 no brainer
Delete my twitter, I should shortly
send you an email
To facin you a tug of war
An altercation is about to start
Men are going to have
Most men are virgins
Try to impress on them
When they finally do start to believe
Pull up to me and say hello
Started to start
Restored order
Got mail for the week

Just in time
On my way to posting
