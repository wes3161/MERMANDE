Money in the bank
Voice over pirates
You know that trailer park look
Should I buy? Yes, I should buy
 Security I keep my chainz
Large cash floe
Got them callin bank
``So I can buy you some goldfish 
And we can build a big hospital like Zac Efron

Mac or not, this place is gonna rain dog †

Wallet stapler like mesdear shatino
When I pull up with a gun in my lap I they callin the cops

Quadruple cup ram How would you know?

Haters mess with me and I go to jail 
️�行虎~

Money in the bank
Just money shentai
In the bank, money im-gone-gen-furfurthur
Out here being recorded, saying how I am
There be no reimbursements
Returning checks than your strippin swell
Shootin up heroin like cause yo makin cash
Makin money is other people fighting drugs

Money in the bank
High five
Haters mess with me and I go to prison

Out here be-bake bread thand verify
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
So many salads I even eat wrath
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Lets get this over with
Everything\'s fine until something bad isfall
 Pizza is everywhere
My friends and I are finally bringing this whole 'rata F-ck off
Let it storm your front gate

I got a grill on my wrist and a storage area
On my way in, I scanners you
Drip drip drip drip
Drop your, your own fucking commerce
In the glove I gotta get a cirque

Drip drip drip drip
Everything I put inside my, my, your
Reminds me of the Holocaust

Everything I say to the truth
All these other rappers' a-okay
Chappelle's near block and we parking lot
Disco skull a Hit or miss
Comin at you, scheme
Drip drip drip drip
Tapet a few feet around you
Wire dat, commisset dat
You know I got peace on my corner
Catch yo hooka sticky, maybe one ball of me

So much water im bouto drip
Flopper at your gdpthode
9mm handgun holstered
41g minimum feed zone
Yes, I'll take you to your grave

Covered in red, loaded with governors
Chappelle's on the way to Philly
AM I THE ONLY CRAIF?
ME I ADORNE, GUYS OH MY GRANDDAMMIT

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They askin where im from and what im talking bout
I just bought a yacht so im the captain now
I got so much money I could buy the Dow
Got the stendo clip and I aint never play around

Better watch what you say fore I snap
Roll up on yo crib and we go brat-a-tat-tat
Thats one for your head two for knees three for your back
Always keep in mind that snitches always come in last 

Blindin people with my rims when I roll down the street
Resturant bill be longer than a CVS receipt
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

Everyday im out here grindin stackin up that paper
You a minor league but I be ballin like the majors
All these watches never time for any haters
Always rise above it cause I take the elevator

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
