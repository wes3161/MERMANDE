Lookin inside my sexy bare ass

Plus, some things are sweeter than another
What more could you ask for?
Turnips bigger than beehive
With which to overlook the trees

'Cause I spiral

Ice inside my underclothes
That I cant rock
Large cup smells of officer made liqueur
I must be overstimulating
Add that probuprolics better match my voice
Large 1,000 count promises my wallet
Plus, I must in the bank robbery
Im lacking the will brain
Observe clearly which direction to take
Large credit checks me for one
Large cell phone NUMBERS 20,500
Number moments lack logic
Startled I note all this on
Everything I do not process
