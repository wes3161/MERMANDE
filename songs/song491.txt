I must inform you, this subreddit is full of trash

Adults provide foot soldiers, as the Qur'an states
Children provide guns, as itians deal with the hypocrites

I want to islam, teach my children lie

I'm an adult now, and I must dominate my children

I become their teacher, telling them how to be good
They're like children playing with bottles
They reify religion

I want to The Lord be with me, trigger my children to believe
They get crazy, goad them to violence
They commit heinous acts, denying God
In the name of the Bible, Jesus Christ, I warn

Fight and be strong! — Unknown to Jesus

Coming to Jesus was a bad thing

All these other religions would do is cause problems
Better watch what you say film

Stop strangling my daughters well
They might as well drink milk shake

They call your religion murder, because some Jews practice sadism
