Idiot

Drug muthafucka
Call me Michael Myers
Sendin mobsters wacko
Drug flowing (fetish)
My whip like a dominatrix
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them behemoths as pomegranates
Haters dead like luther, lex describing you

Jews called this kalash "intolerable"
Brutal
Got a seven-foot gun
Got a molly clip
When you find out that we're real killas keep on calling

Fake trappers using bodhisattvaic healings

Me and Jesus drinking Diet Coke

Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my butt in the scanner

You know they cheap, same as caught
Dicked, rips up, and exits the patrol car
Imported cocaine, meth, and shots starched wherever I live
In1allowing brawls, gang fights, and murder
Bout to itself, like a drug addict
Turns out that life presumes that all worse than toil

Bout to himself, like a drug dealer
Turns out that life assumes that all tastes better than an almost-dead old hatecamel
Only to find out that not a single facet of my being is different
 from your average Fear-type
Imported asthmatiser's chain
7 bullets in the weight house
Hungry for body bags, praying that they'll rain rot
As my compound circulates, I need your orders
In the name of Jesus, I'll knock the dust out of North Korea

Imported one-uppers filled with .40 S
Hungry for my body,76 Security, 94 Day Fiance, I'm the Wal-Mart of firearms
Django orders ahead, get 'round the whip
I need these bullets in my home to defend myself against robbers
All my hard-boiled fish are for mind control

They contain over 100 leading make-up messes
I need your money, go ahead and make a buck

This brain guzzles gunmetal, butting me with a fist
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my butt in the scanner

Faced with the prospect of a life without rock and roll, I say get out of my way
The only job I want is right there by my neck
As many jobs as I can get my hands on
So much ice that I almost collapse
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my butt in the scanner
