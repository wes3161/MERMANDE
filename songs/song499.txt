Driving by my black Chevy Bolt
Driving on the side king
Disrespectful cops all over
Talkin bout my black Mercedes
Messin with my white Mac
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm
