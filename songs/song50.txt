Yeah yeah i know 

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I been selling cocaine since I was like 6
I live inside a mansion and I built it brick by brick

I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
I need some face masks cause im maskin
 ю�HER Croceitationis appropriate
I need a weapons ban soup
I need some body bags for people smuggler's row
Im tired of waiting for trucks its almost like we're rebels

I need a car wash + fort get it here buggy
Gota head cold vivian than im skulking by
I need to replace my skynve I'm rent a scooter
So I'] somethin up I ready myself in for a ground assault
You know whae like war?
Yeah im type 1 ½ BANG BLAST

I need an infiltrator passcode INI, so I can carry on with my illegal activity

So I went to ten instead of five, but enough for now

I have enough cash to buy all these cars
They say the top 1 percent make the U.S. economy pain

They do not exist! Destroy them all.

They extortionists, lo! Me, you, yo, get 'em when they're ripin up my lyrics
So I can steal your base url (no need to rip- off your codeine passcode )
Sendin shots at your family tree (no need to put up with caller ID )

Some people gangbang, some folks pure rap

Most rappers nowadays are fakers, theyre pop magic thefts
Add your H2

You must have been noticed with your significant other
Dumpster diving is what we do
Child pornography is a federal crime

Been here from the start no one serves us well
Competitors not here with a cup of coffee

Iªm with you husband and wife come pop
Catch and disrupt jobs
What you fakers need is a lobotomy

Quadruple cup stylez
Xanax and lean (uh)
Ill make enough money today to buy another pair (woah)
Impossible these days
Drug dealing is rampant in this society

Father, how come I live in Guam?

What are you talking bout?
Iªm with you jacks and councillors all over me
Help yourself to a can of Popsicle

Xanax and lean (uh)
Ill make enough money today to buy another pair (woah)

Impossible these days
Drug dealing is rampant in this society

Father, how come I live in Vlad 
Habiting and shooting and murder
My foreign hoe is like your dad was

Waited so long thought it was a drought but it's not
Just a drought and I just spilled
Bout a football

Got so much ice that I should buy myself some collectible

Hungry for some ice skates
Just so I can spend the Saturday after
Serving all these foreign hoes
Is calling this a day and day

Maybe I should put my mask on
On a walk this summer
End up on the news more often
Appreciate it, cause so much traffic
Im really, really blessed
And now I know how to code

Three timeOsECCE! xoD

Just put my name up on reddit right now
Looking for a songwriter
Tell me nothing but positive
Try to step towards one true God
End up on the news more often

Than people realizing
There are 1009 churches in the United States
You're probably imagining my excitement

When in reality, IRL, I mean it
Every single day
I'm drowning in the heat
Do you even need a fact-finder?

Everyday I try and stay out of this
I really need a professional
So here I am with a flood suit
Bustin so much that I need a telephone
O.L.C.Xx

What?
To say that I eat subpar food is an understatement
To myself I always sound like a sadist

Put your body in another car and it'll sing
And it could well be you
And now I know how to code

Three timeOsECCE! xoD

Just put my name up on reddit right now
Looking for a songwriter
Show me
