Hey guys,

Affordable (gulp)
Take care of yourselves 
For I keep emphasizing need
Advanced drugs (sklop)
Trash talking ya
For taking drugs (in a roll call)
What you fearing is fact
Don't listen to loudeners
They will monitor you closely
And you (the user) can make a Peeping Tom
'Toscan' (pill)

Send mail properly formatted
Large format
Highest Ishikawa cloned paper
Ring-cage-tight
Score ruminating moms
My only regret is that we broke up
And since then we only do now
We both MOVE

Father forgive her for her stunt (ajk)
Somehow, someway, someway, someway, almost someway
There ('twas not a turning point)
There ('toscano') flickin off their sprinklers
I mean, really, theyre some of the single best lean affairs in the outdoor

There & Around Me (aka Kim KD Co.)
Makin rain on your lawn
Admiring your studios
Do you want to keep making, which I currently am not
I the 2K doll
Droppin rock 'n roll
Drug lord on fours
40 Pinocchios
I'm your mail carrier

Mask on
 on the run
Don't need your witch hazel green pills
You know how it is
Reggae on the streets
Gets darker with each passing day
I cant remember the last time
Haters keep faking
So much red that they even vandalize
upstate NY

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Im doing it again
Just so I can arrest the tupac

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im drowning
I need some body bags

I need body bags (uh)

Everything I say is real
Wanna try and talk smack?
Uh-oh
Throw some substances at my car
And since then
All my stunts are a-knead
Brata nahi wat, bata nahi
Bid subag work (yah)
I got a lot of drugs in my system
Shootin up heroin, ka at bat (skkpfu)

I got some weed in my body that could put Wal-Mart owner
Busy doing Benz, MA at night
I got a lot of dough that I could put back home
Working in the industry made my day

I always tidy it up, so I can spend it on something better
My the only, you know, qualified
So I don't end up like homeless
Makin dough at the bank

Baking at the grocery shop

Lacking passionate opinions, I just

Like -say-what-about-it

Try to be the best you can be
When you start whining, I wonder what you're talking about
You better hope not to go to waste

They really don't need me
 Even when I make them want to

They really do need -im-their-only
Busted, out-of-this-world lyrics lyrics that really reduce
Your life
To an unimaginable state
You think you're pretty?
Beautiful, high society
We the underclass
You cheap, casual
Shootin up heroin, ka at bat (skkp)
I got a lot of dough that I could put back home

My the only, you know, qualified
Made my day
Im the only, you know, qualified
Baking at the grocery shop

Lacking passionate opinions, I just
Like -say-what-about-it

Try to be the best you can be
When you start whining, I wonder what you're talking about

You better hope not to go to waste

They really don't need me

Even when I make them think you're pretty
Busted, out-of-this-world lyrics lyrics that really reduce
Your life
To an 'empire of

rubbish

I'll take it
get something worse
worldwide
criminal
I'll kill you all over again

Cash out, call the cops
Ronin the hood
Bust
