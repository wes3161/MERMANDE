I really should raise my voice a bit more
Because these actions manifest in motions so destructive
I'll chuck them all under the bus
When I pull up you can't-miss-it TONY
You really do bring this community to an end

I must say that even though you sound like an average person
I highly recommend you to all of us new MEMBERS
Toast a laugh while making phone calls
Tell someone you're the best at something
Wipe my rear with a pair of binoculars
And I could build a bigger mess under my garage

Most of all, tell people you're the real Dr. Seus
''Tell people you're the real Dr. Seus''
Slash people with cars with bang for your buck
I highly doubt you'll find any of these that well
You really are skittish
You really are mean
You really are fearless
You even die within 1,000 meters

Most of all, get over yourself and admit you're not being "nerdy"
''Tell people I dumped crystal balls
They wouldnt have been invented
Thousands of them would've went straight to the bank

Thousand of them I just heard were for batteries
The only problem is they never charge

I have enough for all of us
Add it on, more are always better
Plus, larger stores are better - for some
