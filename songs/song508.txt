With my all, let this excite
Homeboy wait milling rah-rah
My comforter is racking it like crazy
My sword is tearing the slate clean
I gotta clean this thing off 
I gotta keep this a secret from theur buds

Inside my quadruple cup
It says Shady RL307
Don't talk trash, I pop 'er you know
All my blills are in written language
Talkin bout a 'Riley, run!
 Letterman all smiles upon hearing me
I thought I was a fake
Out here bad, talk poetry
Insecure, easygoing, meticulous
I feel like I'm Creator
Another day, another stud, more like anointed
I'll clear you like a game between dad and mam
Shoot you with as much money as a elephant
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im east Chinese, west Indian, peadiator
I mean really, pretty much any race
You know I always gotta stay above the heat

So when you see me cruisin down the street
Knockin up your front gate
And put an AK-47 in your girl g
Orlando, we're best friends again

Don't talk trash, I pop 'er you know
