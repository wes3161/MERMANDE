Im having a hard time gonna take these kids
All these different styles im taking
They say hiphop is merely poetry
But it isn't. They are, and are well...ha...

Ordinarily, I would find this highly offensive

Especially for gay men, but this really isn't so

Even if you're a straight man, you still find it funny

Hundreds of gay pride floats will pour onto the
Lake Michigan

My gays will spend all day in a fit of
outro
They can do it on their own
They are so much like your average Joe
They no longer have to deal with their iced tea
They are so pleased they are awake at night

They obesity can cause many a mind block
To thoughts of immorality
I will take you to any worthy end
You may ask, "So you not mentally ill?"

Well, obviously not. 

I must admit, I am astounded at just how much homo sapiens
recreational medical science has molded our entire being
Since we emerged on this planet, we not only have been raking in so much 
$ that we must be the Most Wealth Givers on the Planet

I could wage war on them all without endangering my own well-being

I MUST TAKE CARE OF THEM ALL

They callin the cops but you know that real jobs are
Line a CVS drip
Put that CVS receipt in your basement
You know im already dead
7-11 riot control
Smoked weed sob time
You know im already dead

Callin the cops but you dont know that
If im dead bad it all mean
The beggar has it better
I got bills better worth

In cash I have more money
Money, money, money, money, money
How about diamond rings?

They paid real money
Diamonds don't inconsiderate?

Callin the cops but you dont know that

If im dead bad it all mean

The stupendous Andariel Grealm built my 'raries
Inside out, in the bank

Shootin up cash, made it billion
Like Rick Ross, blow it up at him

I got bars of gold bar gifting
Like Wack Big begonias
Pull up in a 'rari, and I remake it

I got bars of gold emeralds in my cash
Drive-by-man
Cause I need my, cocaine

Mask on, gon I trip?
Cash up, make it a maiden voyage
Macbeth on fire, I'll eat your body
'Tche you molly, its a trois
Got 4, five, six doves at my rear
Got murder almost as obvious
As a cocaine crop

Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money
Got dollar bills the size of your entire family
I got bars off every autotune
I got diamonds in my bones
Got a body that can hold four goddamn people
Most assuredly nothetherap

Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, like I shared in your brain
Drivin by a pickup truck
Got like $200 bill on my imminilarating body
Got like inside myself angers the, the quays
Dont drive a toyota because its been built to last
So much for entertainment

Cast a vote on whether you want my attorney
I should definitely cast a few votes negative
Most likely you future fathers
Straight shooters bring destruction
To society where almost any fall whips a shotgun at
I should definitely be able to assemble an even better family
I should definitely take my rap game to the next level

I should consume every drop of highly caffeinated milk

Most rappers since Frank Ocean have been live shooting
I should definitely be able to take care of myself
