So I can start fresh
Pulling even with the draco

They're taking my photo(hi)

Photographing my
upcoming Toyota

They blazed strip after strip of
pleather they looked like you

Loved them about your head
They were rude
At weekend
Take a walk around campus
And don't talk trash

End up on the
