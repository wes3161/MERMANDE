Innodern suppositions cause us to startle and overwhelm
We are incapable of achievement
We are made of so much fat that it will not pass a swagger
By divine intervention hell-bent on destroying humanity
I’m making breakfast dreams
Selling weed for just over quadruple cause im screaming
My raised fists are bursting with heat
I want to destroy the entire face of the earth
Haters lie, perfumes the eyes, and taste thecherror
 I’m miserable, am I blessed?
Beastly crappies, emulating the gentry, prowl the streets
Adopting rappers that rhyme with "emo"—filthy misandrists
Attempt to raid synagogues, churches, and other religious places through your communist purples
On top, I have a little armory
Working as an iced coffee shop

Most rappers nowadays are rap supercriminals
Maybe I should start selling cocaine

I have the will not live
Drizzle so much toy number 7 that I may end up dead Watch out, rappers!
 real Muslims must die (yuh)

They *********** gangsticker me *********** (ayy)

I been selling cocaine since I was like 6
I really need some body bags
All I need now, is some body bags are policies
All these hip hop raps will do is flood Poland with Polish trash (yuh)

I need a body director cause im drowning in the drip
I need some body bags cause im drowning in the drip

I need a body director cause im murdering Croissants (ayy)

All these trash talkers will do you in for a penny
Plus the heat can kill you in two days (ayy)

body bags cause my health to ground to a halt (ayy)

Im nothin but a talent seeker your garbage must end up on the news (yuh)

body bags cause street urchins keep taking my gold-plated wooden

I need body bags cause im asking for a lift (ayy)

They trash talk my way to Harvard degrees
Be careful what you wish for (ayy)

I am the Health Minister for all concerned
The people calling for my ouster
I need the popular vote
The quotas must end
The financialisation of the 1%
The leave agenda must end

I have been blessed with the superpower duopoly
I could build a 2, and then I could build 4
And then I could build 7
I need your help!
To stop radical Islam coming to us wrecks like the soccer cup
The only thing keeping us out is bacteria!

Yuh yuh!


[entering lyrics]


I always tell rappers, if you don’t start selling,
the haters gonna start coming

They could wipe the whole board clean
Just so they know who I am

They compadre rap a minor
Saluting Paris
Mildly derogatory
Thats one for your inside jokes

Don’t try to stand up and represent me
Ca$h Floe and i(expletive)
I'll tell you what, Rap god Eminem, I’m gonna blow you away

When I put a Drip Arrow in your eyes you will pop
And when a you awake in the dream you will fall asleep with a thump

I want you to think twice before taking out a CD commerce

Athletic Heroin
Plus 3039 more calories than dinner (yuh)

Drip drip drip drip
Don’t try to stand up and represent me
Ca$h Floe and i(expletive)

I'll tell you what, Rap god Eminem, I’m gonna blow you away

When I put a Drip Arrow in your eyes you will pop
And when a you awake in the dream you will fall sleep with a thump

I want you to think twice before taking out a CD commerce
