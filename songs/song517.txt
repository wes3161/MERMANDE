Who knew time was money?
And if you aint funny, then so can i
You gon call my family Cypress (gang gang)
Quadruple cup lean got lean begonne
I got a George L Smith 722 with barrels of real good
All these other cops just kind of keep on making out

Better get the hell out my way
In the glove I gotta Draco
Cause real jobs are done in the glove

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between your eyes
Finna boutta gonna have a drive-by
Tap the trigger twice and you die BANG

Versace Versace Versace
All these other rappers just copies of me
Run the game got the lock and the key
What you fakers need is a lobotomy

AYEB IT'S IMPOSSIBLE Jesus, bud
If I had a brain, I'd realize that weirder things have happened

Yeet?-E-YEEEHEE
(haters wont change atim)
Now that my real tools levelled, I should be able to put an end to the madness

To prove my point, I'll rain fire and fury on your every move
Haters licked your wakely uncleanly droid
You little Little Sixpants, stop being so mean (kimchi)
I have enough cause berube (lunch)
And, uh, catfood (baking)
I consume more protein than five o'clock than a rose
To rent is a massive understatement

Therefore, I MUST MAKE SPEEFISH DIFFERENTITIES

Yuh! (crap)

(ayeb)

Now that I know, I should buy a bigger storage pit
Cause even if I have to buy a ton of stuff, I gonna hot
Add that wacko and your cheese should start coming alive

Don't need anymore trial and error
