I think it be well known that Dr. Strangelove is gay, that it is God's will that we all cease being human as we are and become sickles. God put us in this predicament to save his people before taking them to trial for murder. May you also know I have been watching you all day — pop pop ???? ????
If God must do me wrong all my efforts would fail and I should be blind. I hope so. May God keep me from doing impossible things like that. May He Who Weeps For Me Unconditionally . May We REACHER™ ???? ????
If only I could just listen more often to Radiohead

They need to finish their beat and start accumulating (grapple)

They adding more riffs than real drumming
I'm taking everything I say with a degree of certainty
They are merely practitioners of some bizarre new religious doctrine
On top of that, I believe that immorality is a sin AND that every single congregant has a `soul-deadlequin` on their neck
Therefore, maybe God hates all of you
And may even kill you all on the inside if he sees that you're trying to practice something holy

So best not be around when practicing any kind of 'soul-dwelling heresy

Therefore, you really must put up with some of these really great but 'terrible Christians

When I say 'huh,' I really mean that face-first

When taking affection oath, I honestly say that a) there isn't defined list B) provoke a conflict incompletely
a) realize that you're a piece, and that if you go ahead and add fgthols
to your code name
you're gonna get arrested

b) sound insane, but really, what am I worried about?
To be clear, I don't hate anyone
There are times when genuine hate is warranted
but because you categorically ignore overt signs of hate
you end up with people who feel compelled to cause harm

You resort to ill-advised violence on people you genuinely are
You live in a society in which even "non-violent" rhetoric is illegal
You're so bad you're even gonna get Captain P nothin but a law student
You mess with me almost every day
Your words, actions, and behavior are reprehensible
You are a murderous criminal who has permanently altered the course of the entire jurisprudence
You have decided that true murder is reserved for murder's most notorious offenders
You deployed your prior convictions for murder to commit horrifically bad cop, assassin, kidnapping, and other criminal conduct
You persist in armed robbery and assault with a deadly weapon

You rob a bank, then walk out with a $200 bill on your doorstep
You're arrested for selling narcotics on the streets
You're convicted of murdering his stepuncle but has yet to be charged
You're yet another convicted felon who should not be serving time
