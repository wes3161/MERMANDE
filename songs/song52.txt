Perfect for your cougar,


finger metal bands
Trash talking black dudes


Large cash cash in your windowsill
Hella lil buggie fill me with as much cash as I need
Cash up your stack ax
You know how it is
When you pull up with a gun in my face

Pay attention, cash flow is great

Everything I say is real
Shootin up like flag troops

They even have a Parish
Pull out a M1
Pull out a Smith & Wesson
Pull out a Garand
Pull out a Harris
Pull out a Sig
Pull out a Taurus
Pull out a CX-9
Pull out a Rari 4
Pull out a 45
Pull out a four-seater
Travel like a gangsta
Pullin checks, so I can dodge them

I sell cocaine, so I can afford to hoard

I live inside an RV, so Ia gotta stay in place


I pull up, spray up the street
Fill my air conditioner with cappuccinos
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

Pull up in a 'rari, sprayin live cells
You know that they stamped on my body?
I aint ever gonna live
Lay across some ripped brick
Your average black man

Lives in poverty

My real worth is in your waistline

Lifetime lenders
I keep them both at a rock-bottom

Keep in the name of the Father, Jesus
With whips you can take 'em big
Down with hustlers
Got guns for every bone
I give you a rari make it platinum like never
Livin high society, like a doorman

I pop in at GE
Started my own business
Now I do freeways

I should build a whole elsek and start crying Rari

Try to mess with me, I'll crush you like a reppin tape
Busin in massive trucks, you know where I live
What do you need? Just sayin..
Find a triggerman, a bodyguard, and a supply run by the war comm

Don't worry bouta killin money, I eat your memories Alive consensus
Cash loaded, I Cloned4Ug�, gifted it to me, just in time for Thanksgiving
Got five, changed them in the glove room
Got five, doubled them at the airport
Got five, four have-beens
Got five, one's right, busts out with the beat of a random note
Just kidding

Like a lot of people, I skipped straight to the point

Because of that, I don't know what I'm talking about
Now my some serious, I want your number
All my scams are in your folder
Talk to your ex-girlfriend in the car
I've beaten yours all and won the lottery
You know how it is
Asshole washes the mess in my name
When you pull up with a gun in my direction
You like that first trace?
Throw that gun and I'll bring the pain
I have with me, beat 'em all up with a flicka
Shootin up your immaturity
Imbecile drips out each and every letter
