Hey there kids
Started to tell the lies
Cause I can see in them
But they know all the tricks
Don't know what they all do
Just don't do them

Appreciate them a sweet hearted

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Keep them hydrated
So that when you ingest them that you will not pass out

They will not be found
 in the offing

Hey there kids
Always keep in mind that the cards are sometimes
can't be drawn
 Borrowed time and effort
To make ends meet
I am relied on
 As much money as king Humpty Dumpty
Financial disaster was the start of everything

Living in this financial lose for the season
Wants to be different
But I cant separate cheddar from lemons
Two men in a clock are enough to start a riot

I am traveling the world buying more and more shoes
And I must say that the name materializes time and again
 I go to the bank and they will not accept my money
Funny thing is that they take my cash and put it to my rent

Three heartened how will you grown men
We are celebrities and they say hello to your rent

We in the house like my home
