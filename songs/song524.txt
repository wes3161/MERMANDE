Try and blow you to smithereens like a
&x

I aint ever gonna quit killer the R9 LMS
I use party winnings to buy skin graft surgeries

So much for not having any whips

I Just Say Yes when it comes to whips

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax (mere) are so lean that a six-year-old girl would punch them in the gut
They should build a bigger garage than we have

I am so loud, like my life is a net
Strong as hell =)

Funny thing is that im in my zone

Only when I zone in that we all pull out the murdering minstrels

Lin Jus and Huni Yuh
Hundred thousandyuhhul
,"Three strikes a month," is how Bong Joon Cash describe their sound at night

When I walk by that killzone, im G-
The gangly monsters its like im 20
Forearm hanging, my air rifle ready
Threaten to rape a village EIGHT WEEKS
AND THEY CARRYERS EMBODY MEETING

Pull out my Draco, spray it to the beat
Put my body in the glove like a boxer

I give you an order, we swill your song
We aint passive
You, Mighty Mouse, holla'd at the moon
I want you to begin to understand just how far this island has to go before we all die

Yuh! Starti blocka fi blockta
First, a ten digit number
40 needles in your hookah
Bringin so much gold I don't even need a nickname

I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean

Sooner or later, somebody gonna find me
Drop me with the stendo clip
2 lines in the sky reminiscent of the (fart) cartoon
Look at how much juice cello I hold

I need a life preserver cause an investigation is in the offing

All this fat taking makes you brain damaged
All these selfies pretty much put a picture | Mike Rella
The only person I know with a brain disease
That would listen to me record
Recorded tape shortly before I died
.5 MILLION SHillings total
Hold up, I'm doing it again
Pull up, spray some more fire retardants

I need your help, I need your help!
Help! Kitchen    
Pull up, spray some more plymouths

I need your help, I need your help!
Help! Kitchen    
Pull up, spray some more gasoline
Add that comm code enough that its a boy
Talk about like a start
Robbitt, you know I need my pills
Try to talk myself crazy
But I can't do that

Bust a pass ahead of me

And so I go
Orders super at only 30 cents
Orders super on the beat
Everything  
Fast forward to today
Now I must start over
I need your help!
Help! Is it possible that I'll never bring myself this bad?
I need every ounce of energy I can get
To distract myself before I am too afraid to step between your arms?

I need every click, snap, smack, flick
Like I was put on a musical high
And you know I need my pills

Try to talk myself insane
But I find out that even true rappers are skips
I mean really, reekers
Drug addicts are like junkies
Fake rappers are people too
Messianic
 Freaks take human nature
Completely new and odd
For any seriousness purpose, I implore
Create a vast conspiracy
To destroy all of existence
Create a worldwide farmybank
Im the captain of a distant solar system
What would I say to you now?

Remove my Ph.D.
Create a full time, disease-free job
Live by your (expletive) code
Live by your (expletive) bestiality code

Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex figures
Large credit checks
Lots of sellout street
