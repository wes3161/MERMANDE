Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip

No shoelaces I don't trip

Another milf flowin thru the front door
Shootin spray like its a 12
My mic says miscreant conscious
Tap each note and its like im recording
With the volume up, I can rap seamlessly
Myarse vocal cords keep me company
All these watches revive my birthright
I should build a whole life arsenal

Build a life like my house
Carry on
Like I told you was the only way
You never know
While I pumping you with so much steam it can lift
Im really giving myself away

Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you wont be disappointed
Send in the shots, camera phones are calling

Try to talk smack and you start to sound like a dissident
Shootin up film and you blab about it

What do you call my body?
I got one for your head (job)
Like a Roblox
Robbinin on your lil flavor
Makin shoes that could get you in the paper (high bar)
Shootin like Luke Bryan

You know that more than a threat
