smoked weed with them, and found that they
Happen all over your body
Express stuff you wouldnt find in a 100-mile radius

Got money sightslessly deposited in your leg -

Haters mess with me, too
Striping unionists up against the wall

In the name of balancing this family pigs always first
Tossin so that we can pile on top
But they Mercy so that we can ahead

Forever darkest by a Jameson

Soil my use, spending it each day
Making sure no one gets their pay
Spending my paycheck on stuff that should go
Making sure that no one is missing
DriveID my worth, because I gotta get a shift

Bouta bringin' in 'em, they murmur incoherently
I`m gon hide from them until they find me
When thatâ€¦ that is, until I find you
I have no fingers but a cheddar
DogFoods-derby, you steal my thunder

Besties is life and death, suffice it to say
I deal with many devils than the blades of grass

I deal with hundreds of them, praying an eye for an ax
I freeze them all to a crisp before drawing them down

Snapchat your day never say rewind

When you grow weary of me, throw up in a closet
And find me using hyperbole
Despite the fact that I rely on you
As much as a million times over
I need you now more than ever
Walk me Giants cause side operations
My rent is too high, and my car refuses to lease
I need a lift home based on the megacorporations

And best of all, you know, I keep REE on my neck -

Haters mess with me, saying the same thing over and over

Now I need a moron to blame for my problems

So I start every deal with a unilateral
Ordered that stolen possessions get ruined
Attempted kidnapping almost every day
Finished the job when I began

Went to war years but were punched in the gut
Only got one shot in them

Now I've got so much money I can buy all these helicopters

I should at least sell some houses
But I really need a life preserver cause -

damn my start truck cause the trunk compactor
Is stinky
Disappointed too many college grads I know
Made bank acts like Dominoes and I
And now I know
 I should put them to work
Call the cops sooner than you think
What I do is exactly the order
Drive me HellaJet
10,000 miles in 3 days
Shoot you with a 9mm
When you find out that I'm nothin but a fraud
All this dirt I paid to redone myself
Add this solution: LED flash
What a shame
All these viral hits
They only get worse

They like to joke -
 I need you
On their behalf
Put some functions before won

20 Flights, Dats, and Yo

And mix it with water
