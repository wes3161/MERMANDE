Pull up in a 'rari
Rest in amps

I'm a chimera, so I need your help
Trading surplus storm drains for luxury boutiques
I went to a chain of super stores and got 'em
They better find my crew reffering all my rentals

Out here killin like a heart attack or something

Quadruple cup leanit
Got more money in my back pocket
Better defense than a Battelleau

Funny thing is that some nations, like the USA (uh)
Some places you cant get what you ask
Prove it or leave me -- till I find you
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between your eyes
Finna boutta gonna have a drive-by
Tap the trigger twice and you die BANG

Versace Versace Versace
All these other rappers just copies of me
Run the game got the lock and the key
What you fakers need is a lobotomy

AYE that’s how we roll
Wasn’t raised a quitter so i'm never
