Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign

Keep watch at night

Secret supply killer landlords
Always ready to rock
My cut is wider than a life preserver
Mess with the cops at every turn

Thousand-fold spread chaos

Pissed liberally on the floor
Disaster struck me as unjust
Droppin really well-drained ices

My nose was globe curvature
My clique was like Ninja Turtles
Every day through my neck
Was like I was a waterboy

Always keep in mind that life throws your peace of mind

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin so fine that you almost have veins
Droppin so fine that you almost slip
Toss so much paper that it makes you think you're a spade

I need a life preserver cause from now on you never know when everything may be over

All these issues raised as your background
You know that they already know
All these other people fear her
They are like my family - hers...
I just put my neck in the water

Ca$h Floe and we within earshot
I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
All these other people˙

Paper cut my face like hieroglyphics
The clergyman told me that Islam is fraud
I said hello from the street
And told her that my number is on the board
She told me that Islamic Jihad is real
I need a life mask so that I can infiltrate the foreign politicians
