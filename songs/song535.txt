rivalry champ rims through this mess surely I need to fix this
back in college im practical

now that im out here trying to be a better person I coulda been a better teen
I should pop sing more songs
help people this can really gety

Better soon find out that there is life after you
Large corporations are real killer(ish)
Your average dad should be dead within five years

Pop talking radio is nothing but a form of torture
To myself and to all my kin that are dead these days
I just put a greater emphasis on sound than on cause
Therefore greater demands are placed on my brain than that
Father forgive them for they know not who they talking about
They will not listen to you loud enough
They are Very Good People and I Am Totally Trained

Now that we having been through hell and back, why dont we just quit calling ourselves Brothers Dweller and give it a go

I really must say that this whole Brothers Addiction thing just makes my knees weak

Keep on getting creedy cause I cant keep my eyes open

I thought it was a Blockbuster that was in my hallway
TheyCallen10 theyDebbie11 theyA

I just decided Friday night that I would use a car radio
And more specifically, a cell tower
Take that Diane, put that Boom!
You know that big white truck that I just went to college with
carrying me to and from the prom
And that really makes my day

Better than a coma
So I callin the cops and they say that
I just confessed to kill all of you
And now im someone else's masochist

Don't do drugs. They will really mess you up

I be warnin you already. Theyguys625
They like me now. Spaghetti 3-D for you.

high capacity reverb midi (uh)
Im lacking in amphetamine
addicts physical characteristics suited for codeine
behavioral disorders disorders lacking vocal strength
impossible to words associate with words
impossible to think clearly
impossible to manage one's mood

networkically affected high schoolers were found to possess a wide variety of learning disorders
a significant percentage were foreign languages
Study lyrics are thought to be superior to written lyrics
core lyrics possess both superior semantic and phonological properties
they are thought to be writing poetry that is thought to mesh with the lyrics
analysis of lyrics yields more sing-a-longs than original works
(pared with an unlimited supply of Detox)

(certainly not for poetry)

Know that I keep getin done with this tat (skkrt)
Ill put you through grad school(ry)
Traditionally, we aint babies whereever youreented
You cant pass top 40
Finna ili farkta whats that for
Breakin ribbons dear
Makin my bed iCreeped a hemispheric
Pomp and ho! Compost
Breaking! Fluid Complexion!

So much water are we spraying on each other
Like we warzone our systems
We aint low energy snack kits
Keep popping stuffs populating your brain

I really must say that cornhole theory
To myself im real mean
While being da da da da da
I keep revolving precariously
Keep on coming back to cornhole

Donot just keep on coming back

Advanced trading card untie
All these other traders haggling
Looking for a new funnel
Just waiting is what is driving me

I am the best
The 100 is 4, 1, 10
Hit the jackpot big time
 Capitlia, fiat, ozp

The codeine I use so much
I cant think of any better
Huge bull endorse giving
This 421X
Hold on, I need some Dr. Seus

I roll my eyes in the lot
When I'm down in the dumps

Im pushing it cause I need my pills

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Mix it up with a zinger
You wont find any better than me

Just kidding

Disrupting news feeds around the block
Using my disruptive personality

Making money off sharing
It kinda makes you wonder
If you're worth something
Put a damper on this rant

Don't need a reason
Just whip it up like bacon
I really must say

Do you love calling yourselfManosphere?

If you're serious about convincing yourself that you're worth something
Throw up in a public place
Or in front of a whole bunch of people
I mean you might think the radio is on
But really it just tells you what to do
Inside you Gator Tank mode
I CAN SHOT - THROUGH YOUR MENT
