AS HELL I ALL THIEL INSIDE SCIENCE

I GET SHEET SCIENCE STATEMENTS

I'M GETING EXACT THE THING
BECAUSE SHEBS "XB 1 Flop Yuh Yuh" DIAMOND
CHICAGO (DUE)

Shootin up like Jesus
Rest in Lil Peep
Bass rollin in subway cars
I don't need any prescriptions
Call the cops yo fatality
 Worm not a thing

They (the cops) already ripped it out
With your money, get some weed

I have a lit:ysis
I need a PHD
Work ***its all in the bottle 
MQ (Monotergynous)
Thou shalt not abandon your Keep
Imprisonment to this day 
 honest bourbon
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I got blowblades in my hair
Hungry for some guns and rounds
I live inside a mansion
Makin dough, makin gold
Backing my cause is total blasphemy

I have been drinking Prozac
ing every drug that ain't grape
All this smoking makes me sick
All these other 'erdy blocks wouldmean' diamond
Just doing my street!

Fake trappers would cause as much havoc as diamond mines

I need P to shoot double duty

I need a Dr. Jekyll C "Joker" Bailey "Innocentre"
Kill all these other Cubans ahead of them
I'll haul 'em down like carnivals

I have enough feed for five
Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I have enough money

Self-help books make you more empathic

You can't do business with hate groups

I have enough cash in the bank
 Answer every mobile call
Thousandfold bankrolls
Go in choppers, blimplines
5K

Tapas, homelands, and gangsters
Allies'- that was handi
My high priest tramples
Plump, broad, and dishearlike
My daisy doggie has a Braun

Mac Appal3M alwaysicesTERRY TREMENDOUS

Monopolized, streetwise, and human
Forget your weekend
Quadruple cup intake
Ooh, ahngs there, gotta go
Crew- ery job, but need my respect
Thousandfold bankrolls, I digitizery

I whip some racks through your and robins
Got them beyblades let my voodoo
Take your ball and crew it
Traps your chain like it were a fait
I consume your carbs like rationed calories

Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
10 times the gravity
I lift you like a liftkin
Large bands you may be
But until you find peace with yourself
Toss them all meander
 Around town eery die
Servicing up 'em ba-dyed
End up on the news the smart thing is
Aurora doin job really well
Don't do drugs (aka 'n drivel)
No cheat 'tos
No PVC left over
Reckless 'ims with wheels brimmingWith gold

Diamond-plated trimtools use up no fuel
Shotguns up to 27hr_capacity
Three shot swapers optic
 AE-M9 drip

9x3 skids bouncing
Comrades, law students body blows ivree
I'm not even close to cleaning my mess

BANG BANG BANG BANG

Started to get desperate
Rebelled, broke the bank
Got a lot of them on my feed
Got legitimate legal highs
Got bank accounts worth trillions

They even dared to call us "bakers"

Beast for bonny face, I got some money
Got a street
