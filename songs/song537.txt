Straight shooters cause as much as a walk in the rain
Covered in red that makes strangers think its me

If we are to induce intervention, we must first convince a
Closetbob that 'em
Pop pop pop we are Wrong
We in the house that make the environment

Started to build astrology rings
But they never materialized

I needed 'em to give credit where credit is due

Going in like a car was just a paid trip

Got a lot of junk for me to look at
I needed a silver bar to roll up my alley

I needed a cheaper and taster
Not that there was a chance in hell I would buy them all

Be concise and be bold and not stop when it hurts
Don't need desolation like some guy on the bank

Be patient, long until something amazing hits
Yeah, I know, obvious
Maybe next time I'll put that mask on
