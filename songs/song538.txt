Allybase loaded
Choppa come to life
Throw cocaine at my body

Got it so I cant dose
Me and Mac Bleu need to go weight training


Pop popa pop I live
Am I the best?
I cant pass sobriety

Everything is worth its weight in gold

You wont be disappointed

Name: Giles Mac
Race: Caucasian
Sexual Orientation: Monogamous
Fed up with my life
All this time ruining it all
Now talking trash
Looking for a social life
Mess thinking all of a tlll
Finna get over myself
I know some folks are capable,
Others are not
Just know that much message board time is required

You can be one of them, for that is what we have here at Visionary Focus

1. Corporate Possession
Found. Wonderful.
2. Separation Anxiety Disorder
Im lacking in goals
Jumping in the mindset that I need to get this over with
I dont have any need for subcultures
Using my masculine features often
Making me want to shoot
 even though I cant see glazed window skis
What a shame

Im sicker than an old man

Cubs at home, calling the shots
Finna, nada, saber
Babe, rent a car, and when I say rent a car, I really mean buy a garage
Take a bath in champaign water, pour myself a poo
And now I recoils from the shower

I cant think of a single time in human history where language, thought and sensation have not been abysmally undermined by the perceptual and real substrates of time and space

Ugh, what a shame
Jet fuel can't melt steel beams
All these other warmongers already dead
So myself and my crew are still warmongering
Got a lot of gold, so I'll keep it inside a gun

So when the storm hits, I'll be Kinda Heat Gangz

Wipe my TRP (transmitter thing)

And told lies before that committee

The emotional toll of an attack thwarts my most careful evaluations

Even after pouring my heart and soul into my cause

I still find it chilling that so many deserving killers exist

They call myself the 'Luther of Chicago'

Cause I spread the lie that steel cages are only temporary 

I still keep watch on every inch of this prison
Out here killin posersitons
But every one of them aint funny, so I keep an open mind
Rest in suspension don't you think?
Now that the war's over, makin' noises like a dissident
Sending my captured comrades on hunger strike

And exile is not an option
Living on the street I keep watch on your every move

While I expose humanity to the rest of the world

Hold up and get something worse than a cease-desist
And every time you walk by my
