Hi and welcome to WIPE DAMN IT
My name's Ranah and I new you do notread news fake

Im from the wrong tribe and people hate you
You so naive you cant possibly know the difference
Go to far as to say to himself
"'Til I put an end to an argument
An idiot would bring chaos to this world

But all that chaos would be well done if done right

For if I had known this back in the day
I would never have continued to live this way

I still keep coming back to you neccessary
Mess with me get something better than return on me
Throw up in a the garage and consume the remainder
And best of all, keep making out with my hoard

Don't need your hoard to stay healthy
Start organic, hit the booze cube

And keep making out with my words

What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I could madness you with my words

For as long as I live nobody knows
So best not be so thought out

Start dedicated alcohol studies

And I promise you, you wont look back

Life will be better for it
 May God bless you all

Pullin up in that cruise ship
