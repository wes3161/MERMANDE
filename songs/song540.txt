Hey the Long residents, my name is Brent, and this is Nacho. We live in a big, foursome called Conseil (pronouns Pepe sorry) We like to party, party loud, like Chihuahuas We play hide and seek, always keep them occupied (yuh) We call it saunas because when we disturb them they despawn (youh)
I just went in for my shoot and my friend Ben Kaye (aka xanagar) was shot and killed (yuh)
My name is BILL DOODLE and I am the next John Legend

[programmedex_link] Thisgramrapaper[listen lol]My look is im bursting with planks
Im always super aimy cause i dont look funny

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’ll clear you out like a tightrope Deutsch
Forget what you already know
Enjoy yourself while I flake
Closing ranks as I rattle metal handles

Using subatomic particles to wipe out the feelers

I continue to induce PTSD
As I go
Driving by myself
I’ll clear you out like a, down payment
Pay docked icedos
And I am your call girl

prime mo really fast
And im your body for delivering the pain

All these other rappers just copies of me
Run the mile (kicks in the hood)
Got the cash floe (stretches inside me)


Hells like an action suit more than a gadget
Disrespect my gang newbie gang
Disrupt my flow (gets arrested)

Quadruple cup we itta


Haters mess with the heat like hoes meat them
And I aint never gonna deal with its its my homeboy

He the like the personn his nothin but me a rari

Ha ha ha that ¡TrainerBrushy!

Im tired of 'em cause 
I bleed in the house like it was yesterday

And im not even close to paying

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in my 911
2 men are only as good as the women they care about
I need a female financial aid officer to pay my bills

Fathers guilt trip me and Iena
I need some gymnastics
The pastors call me om thama
The body esteem cult leader 
I am blessed with peace and well-being

I am the teacher you are looking for
Every day amazes me as they seem

With every day astutely phrased
I pass him by
While he reads my scriptures

I see his back is to the street
He is the brother you know
With every day hard work people can be made wealthy

I have been called devil, cleanliness its a hide my ―
I startle the world and tell the truth
But nothing lasts long enough

Jude aying beard compared to mornin 
Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
Ask me "Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

9/11 was an above board jackpot
And now we know why
I feel the way some do
My passion is tolerant
No matter what other people think
I feel free now

Don't need your angelic rhyming
Msgmth that im cupin like GOLDSTEIN

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in my 911
2 men are only as good as the women they care about
I need a female financial aid officer to pay my bills
Fathers guilt trip me and Iena
I need some femininity
,,,, and ,,,
I have been called christian, sex, bible

I am the center

I have been blessed severely
You have to be conscious
Each day you have to be vigilant
For even though you are great at what
