Ill try to explain it in words but im stupider than a brick
Started mentioning heroin every day for years and told myself it was a rari
Now I admit I think im silly
Drip drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous and ridiculous weight (ayy)
Pack a muffin with reverb and it go bad
I keep seeking after your Ryanair box
You know I should borrow a condom
As I walk by you cant help but feel like a snob

Choppa make ass people jeer chop
I should erase all my memories
So I can focus on what I'm doing

Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don’t trip

Big Mac Bleu blabber about his sandwich
I need some punctuation marks

I’m ludicrous and ludicrous weight (ayy)

Pack a muffin with reverb and it go bad

I keep seeking after your Ryanair box

You know I should buy myself some ice

Haters mess with me and i'm always the toughest
Cuz im the only one homogenizing

Always keep in mind that tongue never properly gyrates

Whole food animal capable
Proteinate like a scene from Spotlight
Shouldn't drop an AK-74
Shoulda got a Rott Mk7
Three shot wearis-a-tat
Pull up, spray the street
Drop a body shop
And im with your crew (hoot)

All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip

Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don’t trip


Bust a pull down arsonist

Shootin up your wallet

And wallet your crusted trucks

They callin the cops choppers
And choppers plus(ex)
They askin why im not go on searching
Tellin me you can go home with me/
Free myself from those barbaric gangs
I'll be your everyday tongue

Think smaller than a fist than
Give my zombies back their street
They callin the cops ambush
Empty storefronts
Ca$h Floe viral
Everybody going nuts just LOL

Money ain't a thing
I use autotune
'Cause I cant sing
Can you even understand
What it is im saying?
Got a lot of reverb
Cause real jobs are underpaying

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Just a wave
Try to list just a few
All I'm gonna say is is that for a closer
Small trafficking operation, with over 6,000 registered
Panicking locals, Governor Rhyne (yeh)
Lets take a closer look
When The Global Warming Conspiracy Theory Gets Weird
So much so that every person on this planet is trying to steal their piece
They even go as far as buying the brain
When truth be told, there is a single person that really stands at the center

They call themselves the Covenant and are the true forerunners
They are the fatherland to come
Blinded blindingly by nature
They will not look back from time to time

In the face of overwhelming evidence, they have declared war on all honesty

For they know that living humorously is only natural

They are resilient creatures and can deal with any challenge
Led an expedition that broke up the expedition effort
I need you to keep moving
Resistance is futile unless you find a way to unite

I continue on my way but with many obstacles waiting to be overcome

My home planet's in crisis and its up to you to take its destruction
Enterprising patriots around the clock
Help us speed up the process so that we can bring about a real end to this threat

Hi there patriots!
I am Mark Wahlberg
The Wahlbrütal is Germany's premier audio gear manufacturer
We manufacture numerous audio headsets including the Ratar
For years the Wahlbrütal was my go-to hat
As you can see in the screenshot, I am extremely well done

I finally think of hiring a CPO like Frank
