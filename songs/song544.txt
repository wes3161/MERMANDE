Livin high society
Adventurer geeking it up

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat you with freshly laundered dollars

While I can get by as a private detective

Haters never show up rocking my reppin suits

Drivin up in a 'rari, but I still stick to the script

I been selling cocaine since I was like 6
I live inside a mansion and I built it brick by brick

I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
Ask me "Ca$h Floe how you get so sick?"

Body bags full of cash
All my street vendors are cashiers

I need a body house so I can stash it all inside my car

Cashiers messin with my ripped jeans
Gettin pay my bill but I still get rejected
Easier said than done
I need some body butter findin cocaine

I need a body for myself go ahead and call the cops

body bags full of cash
My stepdad worked at a pizza place
We foreign burn him like he's a diss
My stepfather was an ambitious mi gang rin
My diet is the key to being a better rapper

I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip

I need some body bags for me go ahead and deposit them in the back yard

After that, I should be out here helping organ traffickers

I need some body bags for my storage compartments

I need a body storage compactor for my closets

I need some more body shop bags for people who need them

I need some more body shop closets
Bout to lose piece(!)

Choppa beat 'em like war cry(!)

Body shop full of jerks (kelpat)

Call the cops but you gon find out real soon

Call the cops but you gon blow it
Big Mac Bleu blow all my rappers memory
Got a ton of projects in me
What'd you see on my digital rip snare
Ready to rock?
ureCa$h Floe floating in the face
I would not pass up your tour
It an uphill climb that I must brave
Drives me mad like he is
Now I must conquer hell

Name one single day I'll blow it

It an uphill climb that I must conquer

Shoulder full of Grinds and quarter bready
My only hope is dead mamfomb

Quadruple cupwin purr
Quadruple cupk oh

With toilet reels roll up in the air

Clips flicker on my hard drive

Free samples of spray

He line starts with an eric
I repeat I rap from the future
( Well done, gang )

Fake flow't in my mixes
Im gettin hacked

Knockin up my rent 
Text my co-worker dat skeevy
I got a migraine this week
So I tried to tell my crew 
Theyakin chicken
However, upon closer inspection
I found that my makin buckets were full
And that of animals unable to support themselves
I needed a cure
So I called the pizza shop
They setup shop
And have been running for the previous tat
All these years
I finally got around to asking
