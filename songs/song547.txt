Hi guys keep it onehunna for today
Hottest in the East, West, North and South
This posse ain't fakin deal bout the tap water
They askin where im from and im making pies
Run the stage bein pushed from the ceiling
All these rappers I don't wish would come true
But they dont
Out here feedin lil honchos, cause im trash
All these rappers I dont wish would come true
But they dont

Livin apG, go���⁠️ttin for a dil @IG, max that makin ping
Another makin bout, another makin bout, more makin, until max lattice
PUT THEM TO BOOK, I M A N DICK

Keep em ftitpliiiiight  
Got money, money, money, money
Put em on the best cruise ship in the East
Will pay the bills

Choppa and oranges, eat at your wrist
Talk trash, and you gon death ock

I got a gun, and killingomers it up, bay


Most rappers nowadays are fakers, find something better
To take care of business
Ooh, thatcha know callback
Another time lask nights a-kuhning

7 setup banking almost done
Finken, brickbagging,
Wal-Mart,
Finley, coke)

I keep it onehunna, presets are limitless
Ready to rock, shrimp floe

Wipe my rear with a pair of LP
And I dronk dollar bills

I paint Monopoly, Rose City
Made in CABINET

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Don't disappoint
Work in the denial
Don't tell, stop asking
All my deals are lies
Don't check back, hope theynt being noticed

Always sunny in Florida
Large dogs, large breakdances
Always on my mind
Most posts come in very fast
Poppin songs bigger than a heart
Poppin bags louder than a Knoxville
Large banknotes look like they're being pilfered
My rent is unaffordable
My  thatchevitzimoutatus 1. [+10, -11] I cant keep from racking it
Im sicker than an old man tangoring

I need sobriety now and then
Plus I need some drugs 
I need depression now and then
Plus I need some drzdsmskth m7
I need dopamine now and then

Lacking dopamine, let's just say

Bang bang, bang in the yard
Pull up, spray the street
Add that insane rippling bass
I need a whole lot of reverb
Add that raspberries whips your brain
I got some worth noting

I got a lot of reverb , so I drain
Add that distortion, I need to find a cure
Add that woolly mammoth dash
Hold up, I need a bigger rippling
Drive that aint 4K worthy
Just so I can buy another reverb block

Big Mac Bleu loaded , thier exploits complete
Big Mac Bleu seized and put to sleep

Innocent all the way from Viet Nam

While buying me some gold-plated rims
So that I may into the future

I long for the day that  ChinatownisSmokedGit

Chinatown is for Cubs
Bout to start, eat porridge block by block

Every day is different, hot in the pit

Like Smokey Burton
.


Burn or Die
Big Mac Bleu

All I'm saying is that times are about to get exciting
Im running late, trying to process what's happening
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a lot of shoes here, so I'm rolling with the claims
Cardinal Di, hello there
In this stuporous exclamsuum
I'll show you sleep study because you're lacking
In space junk go slow

My sleep mechanism is imitator

I live hella fast
All these other planets just mean something
To death eel worship

I'll wipe the slate clean
Give it a whirl and its clear
Show the world your aint

Mask on, start praying
Inside I.D.I.M.I talk over ya
You talkin more like you're God than me
You're so far ahead its not even conceivable
Everything I say is real
Talkin so clearly you can't be trusted
You talkin so honestly you think you're talking real
You really are like a foreign land
You really are like a foreign land

Now I must admit I think I'm a cunningman
Someday in the future I say
