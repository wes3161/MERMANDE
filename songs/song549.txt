Big Mac Bleu being attacked by his hunter gang reppin
He asking for your help has been Storytime
Your call is being considered
Â  They ask for your diary so that they can watch some of your South Asian
assassins
I cant think of a better insult than murder
To all my phone calls I keep asking why you're here
You a crooks person
I just got released from police custody
You an ass,iny nothin but an Academy fil9ued

Drip drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like an Army sonnet

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the crisp tongue
Every day while you runner me like flow

So much dough you almost slip

Pull out my Draco for kicks
Make dinner gals look like skanks
My trips are some of the strangest
I need your help Calling an election is easy
In my thousands I romp through the rack
I need your help Being a reality star, I don't need any favors

Starting a new career I want to be a doctor
That way I can spend more time doing my Project Exile

Bout to mow all my haters down

Put my hat back where it came from

When I got certified as a painter, I could buy a whole lot more than I ever had

Droppin bombs like an Army sonnet

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like an Army brain
I need your help

I really need your help
Right now, I'm just processing this
The technical debt is making me need debt
Starting a new life full of problems
I need your help I need rescue
What if everything went wrong?

I mean really, what if everything went so really really that bad you could barely lift a finger?
What if everything went wrong all that really went really well?

Well, that could get pretty deadly real quick
Try as you may, this isn't a game where you win or you lose
You may lose, if you keep pushing I mean really, really fast
You may not be so fast, but you'll keep getting better
You may be smarter than we are, so better think twice than me
You may not talk trash so openly, but you'll keep making out
You may be different than other homies because of where you are now
You may not understand why so many young gay men live in the swamps
Hey there baby, been causing a mess
In my sleep I have been making sure you really know that I are a loving and caring family

I have made a mess of everything I own and kept making changes
The last thing I need right now is that you will let go
You better hope that my puzzles are not far off than someone new

That would be terrible and would put me in a really bad dream
So when you see me out here doing something awesome 
You better barricade your window since I may pop your 10

Another fake gangtsa out here making dough

Everybody stop and starin as I movie you thisesome
