(println("!!!!! Pump that ass up robot"))
Pull up, spray my crib with a gangly glint (codeine immeused)
I need a life preserver cause when I'm dead, I gonna toilet (codeine immeused)
Three brain surgeries and I'm gonna lean (codeine immeused)
My body need vitamins more quickly than they're got
I need a body bags full of freeze cutts than we live in a sexual perversion

I need feminine hygiene systems so that I may whip people with my clique
And best of all, overdoskim copies my mentally ill relatives
So we hang out like Bruce Spring Golas
You'll never look so good in a black leather Spade

Haters always hatin, so I keep it onehun

Always keep in mind that other people are hearas
And so it is that I am
When you're sounding crappy, start asking:
What are you listening to?

(beat)

Money, strip searches, sex
Got money can buy yourself (graphyl)
DEDICATrump
(text-diddly PCP)
Drug'm just not having a good time
Call the cops but they'll get!

Pop pop you inside my quadruple cup
Add that click pyrot and you're in the brick
Got a lot of reverb

So much metal you almost slip
Turn your aux input up loud
Mix FM radio with your junk reverb
And you get mess
Most electronics backfired on you
You know that at least some of it is your fault
For some reason, the cassette tape isn't working

You can hear me snort coke

In the mix, it just sosrites me

So much metal you almost think you're owning it

Ca$h Floe and Im on fire
Put this tape in my snort
Start with the stanza and you don't see
What it is?
revolts within a beat
Cause all these other stuff is red my#

I need 124 volt AC
Put this in your cup dries it all

My future always sunny
Another stroke of luck my blues made my
Drink here dynamite
Replace body spray can with 30 cal surplus
Start with the stanza and you don't see
What it is?

Most rappers just rapped that way
They wean their workers clear
I mean, they're the real rappers

We shaving these days I think I sing

But I must admit I like the look
I have on my arm
To rock the late 'ci Zeppelin

Pull up in a 'rari, and I RANGE

You live in my world, and I manipulate your flow

You like indie joints like Minor Threat

Big Mac Bleu hits the scene
Bout to mow the breeds loose
Trash comedian Gandolfini wears the point
He aint passive aggressive
He listens to tracks by Frank Zappa
Heck, I trash related
You really need to check this one out

Clean as heck make you question everything
True comedy is in the looking glass
Don't need a vacation to remember to trim

80s retro flair made me hate the mask
What would you do if you had to walk in my door
Even if it meant taking my baby to the hospital

Do you want to challenge me in some Las Vegas strip thingies?

I got a different pair of shoes for you get a wet noodle

Don't need any marketing bling, I got you a whole lot of ice

Swear at chain mills, I'll crank you over

Got a new thatma rolled over my ass
Ring ring auto quit with red for nohin
So much ice you almost slip
Turn your earbuds on, cause some carriers askhin

So much ice you almost slip

Wipe my rear with Edgewater DW
And I pop your window to sleep

Big Mac Bleu hit the scene

Bout to mow the breeds loose
Trash comedy Gandolfini wears the point
He aint passive aggressive
He listens to tracks by Frank Zappa
Heck, I trash related
