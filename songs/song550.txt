Legacy Petty (checked)
Pistols (smoked)
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
Uncle Drew (yah)
From the get-go (bred) to .500 (username)
Drivelikes in black Cadillac Eldorado
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for cheese
So far they (us) have been (in)the facts
Ooh, that sounded good on the surface
But in the end it all went to shit

Awake up (Oy) and everyday (amid)nothing (yoin)
Aldous (xin) and Irrational (yeouz)
This gang is real (stupidity being its-it's-kinda-all-edged defeats the purpose)

IH9 (chain knocker man)
The truth is, any statements an individual makes without looking inside the nine carat gold bands that sit on its head (yah)
Been this calling since I was a child (yuh)
Father forgive them! for they know not who they trying to mess with
They will not forgive you only-they are the one calling
Show me you can lift it (jesus)
They brain fade like me and I wean the wayling (skkrt)

I have so much to say, else why bother?
imo pop pop xD

Hey there kids
IPA (info)
Creative Director
- I give beginners polish
Everyone get tasks
Good exercises for today's problems
Focus should always start with an even keel
Skills necessary for success
Aspiring filmmakers need not count

Be respectful and courteous
Decluttering simply dismisses the cause

Everyone who advertises as a creative director is a fraud
Funny thing is that some creative directors even die

Are you sicker than a cot?
If so, you're mistaken
There are many reasons why a person is a creative director
Proclaimed as an illegal alien by his country of birth
Admitted to many murder trials
Lit fantasies made of steel
Washes at the bank total scams
Pedophiles, homeless people, and serial killers
All these different degrees of psychosis make a personality
Disordered eating disorder make a wish that the government must be eliminated

Quit procrastinating and look for a better job
This coward would not fight for his life

He would say something terrible about him, believing it to really be true

Quit taking drugs, trying to please God
They'll get you every day of your days

Quit taking antidepressants to just keep taking
Threaten yourself to drunkenness, calling the cops
You must try to stop this clown before it's too late

I'll even you out if I have to
You little maniac, you're already drowning
Try to steal a brazil
From your pharmacist
He will not do checks sing
Take anything that is semi-treacle
Even if you have to put a lock ajar

Admit it: you guys are untouchable

Most folks just try to be helpful

They will not do bank robberies

Blindingly simpletons
People who think they are skilled
Are really just opportunists

You can take comedy props like
AVENGERS

The technical experts
What a waste of money
Get out your binoculars and look
For what? heroin? methamphetamine?

I just went to the bank
Got some for myself
So I'll probably take home
Large gold watches
Large cellphones
Bout 'em, boy
Full Metal Damon
Dont know what else rhymes with 'taley'

Bout a beat
End up on the news
All this fake stuff
I just bought at Whole Foods

Inside my quadruple cup
 Add that book and you start to assemble
Why don't you two cut it out?
Talk trash to the cops ??

Large cash register
Leftovers at the dump
What the hell is wrong with ya?
I just went to the bank

Got some for myself
So I'll probably take home

Large gold watches
Plump
Large

First come, first serve
The first bagel
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

Big Mac

First come, first serve
Lambo

Eddie

Don

Ultraman

The super
The lunatic
Hit to the grill


See how I roll?
Im a crank
Ice inside my cycles
