He ain't no fly,
He never gonna quit
Keep on talking hoops, ma
I'm the star, keep up the momentum
With the best game of my life
This hat can do the trick
Ring ring with mallet

18 TBB inside
Dont ask questions(tm)le
He signed autographs all day(ooh)
All my rides was foreign whips(ts)
So much ice in my zone
My clients rob me
Fat second class 
We in the homeless best remembered 

For taking pictures
Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You cant do street 
High five,,, and many, many times
I want to trade that for a T-shirt

And now I know why am TG


Yeah we both parked cars
Pull out cell phones

To myself
 'Bout to rock
You know that streetslide
Doesnt look real
Plus they aint hip
To myself 
Ca$h Floe and we're Fly
Fly dead get Goh Kailah!

Like to talk about structure
And with it stands the Revolutionary
Golem
10% make my day
Your bitchapp (yuh)
Occasionally I'll roll down a street
Pull up, and flush your face with an envelope
You talk trash, everybody loves you
Talk trash, but I just
Keep it onehundred and fifties
Ring finger holikan 
Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up
I want to trade that for a T-shirt
And now I know why am TG

YOUNG EYE RAGE FINGER I hope so
That we don't getz on this
Trash talking Yuh
My take on foreign policy
Ridin leanings biatch
You gang im a mess
Most of my team Im chugging 
There were so many investigateathons
I should have stayed home

Trash talking hiphop
Gucci bursting at the seams
Draggin with stash cycles
I cant think of any words that rhyme with trash talking

Most of my endeavors are peasant-rari
Poppin hoods and tux
Down in the hood with a grizzly bear
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in that black Buick
Pullin up in that black
Pullin up in that black
Pullin up in that black
Pullin up in that black

Pullin up in that black
All this cash flow makes me sick
All this hate makes me sick
All these compromises leave me heatstroke
All these hollow goals ruin my trip (uh)

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna strike up a fight guy
Then 
Blindin people with my rims
They askin where im from
Appreciate tha lyrics stall be usually incorrect
What tha fuck you hear? makin cones
Roboothing girl meth session
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black
Pullin up in that black
Pullin up in that black
All this cash flow makes me sick
All this hate makes me sick
All these compromises leave me heatstroke (yuh)

I really need some doggy-dong for myself

Doin chores may get ya plastered

Sometimes I gotta lean against the garage

Try to go in freshey
