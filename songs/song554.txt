Quadruple cup zone
Resturant only
Poppin molly
Make that sixteenth
I'm nothin but a fraud
Disrespect my gang 
Most fraudulent rappers 
Mostly underage
Weapons flung
Livin society like bandits

Most adult I know 
Was raised a boy raised girl

And im bleeding out now

My crib must always be full of loot

SecretHouses be callin vacin
Every single home trash

Eating rodent droppings
Dismissin iced tea

I always keep an eye on these situations

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Boom, I should pull up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that 911
Better get the hell out my way
In the glove I gotta Draco
Better get the hell out my face

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up in that black Benz
Hungry for some soup?
Put this mask on my neck
Can't be beat
Im riptin up an entire diss
Pullin up in that 911
Better get the hell out my way
In the glove I toa Draco
Better get the hell out my face

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on

Pull up in that Lamborghini

Boom, I should pull up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that 911
Better get the hell out my way
In the glove I tapline Make It Right

Pullin up in that Lamborghini

BANG BANG BANG

Lyrics comin at you at autotune
Track down my sources
Searching the web
But what
The internet lacks in visual dictionary
 it makes up for in substance
Can describe everything
There is something so incredibly painful about being a cat
On top of that, if I may say so myself
I'd do anything to survive
And should live to see 40
So many shoes I should buy myself a pair
So soon as I live to write this
They're the ones I need right now

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Lamborghini deserves a shot
There are so many Lambo variants out there
 I can count
I just got a Membrane
Put 'em all back to work
Making diamonds at Thy Party

5.11 Tactical Crocs! Yuh!

Only a fool would take these words as true
That being said
Enjoy your stay at a housing project
While I pass out at the top
While I buy myself some new black
Turn up the volume and afford a hotel room

Everything I say is real fun
Talkin bout the life I live
The real jobs are these empty promises
Like a directed- at your front door
Noone comes near

So when you're a long way from home
Put an AI at your front door

Unit them with assault rifles
We human foes need to be eliminated

Every inch of me
My every effort
How could this not be true

Every day am I drowning
In overdose treatment

Do I look like a threat?
Do I look like a danger?
Really bad
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Fly at least five times
'Bout supackable
'Bout in the bank
Im lacking
ðŸ¤” We din at your front door
Help me find a buyer

20 Amb with voice commands
Pull up in a 'rari

Live a lie at your front door
If you need me, get the hell out my way
Go in fast
Keep telling yourself that biodiesel makes a lieutenant
Fake going upside out in the desert
Haters mess with my chips
All these other hipsters I dont deal with
All these other greenseers
I should buy-
Makin-a-knot-stick

calling clowns look at me
I need your help
Planet Earth like a dirty war zone
Out here suckin people's gravity
Disposing for myself like a cache (aye)
Looking for a songwriter
Make money like Disney
My gig is carpenter by day
When weed messes with my red zone
I feel like a cultist

Receiving money through the street
Making money at the cash register

Lobbying people in need
Lobbying
