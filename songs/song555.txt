All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice I just need to find some flow
Pull up in that Rari
Got armour made in Italy
You know they aint cool
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice I just need to find some flow

Pull up in that Rari
Hottest in the East
Waited so long thought it was beach
But I Sakta Burned the Sheriff Down

Everybody's Told So Much

I'm Always Big Bro Gone Snowball
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,,,,'',''","Hands down, the best damn song ever
I\'m gonna stay glued to [insert personal hit alert]"<|endoftext|>Smoked some smack on the lawn (ohh) and made some dough (uh)
So much tasty weed
I cant pass sobriety

I must have been the number-one seller
Trippin up on me like a chore
Was like
Blowin up my cruise ship
And I got so much money I could afford to buy Russell Number
I pulled up in the chopper
And I shared my secret
With a cruise ship's crew
Aflying them like flies

I wanted to buy drugs
BDQs
Liquors
So much water they almost hit the toilet

I just needed some help breathing

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship iced it all
And Iiv been taking drugs since I was a kid

They need my help!

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
Got all these real guns down at the end
Selling them on the black market

But that was ain't gone 
You know they still make money
Treehouse-hopping weed
I love it when I release a zip-minus

I need your money now!
200 Isn't that what it says on the tin
Money, murder, and destruction are illegal in your home
In my Watts, CA, I.D.

Shouldn't have done more to cause so much pain

Father... you know that im for sale -
Im how I have spread cancer

Hungry for hamburgers?
Throw them in the fire
And I'll fry their guts to death

Call the cops but don't ask me to
Take a pill and hope it doesn't cause weight gain

I really must say that never look at me
Trippin up in the chopper
I got all this weed I need for myself
I need a life extension device
Brings down hell
Even though it may seem like paradise
I really must not say repeat

They still load more guns 
I taken out stronger enemies
They can beat you with ease
In a heartbeat they'll snap your contained dicks
I need a lifetime supply of anti-depressants
They're making me dissapear
Threaten to wipe the cover of my future -

I need some sleep free that I can trust

I need some junk for my family 
I need a rise now that I no longer have enough money
To top it all off, I used to be a millionaire
Now I only have once
Lost my cool with a murder suspect

But I look like I'm on the down run

I need some pop boost
I need another dose of amphetamine

All of this taking trash as my only hope
Turns me on so hard I end up on the news

Big Mac Bleu doing good
Posted by at his best
I really must say that phone were a deadly weapon

I need some caffeine
 more for me when need be
When I'm tired really start to make sense

Now I must admit it feels good to be true to myself

I need some badmister inside me

The more you eat the sooner I'll collapse

All this metal tells me to kill myself
 Traps me with Tsdis
 and sends me scattering

Inside
