Trump sentiments painted on Wisconsin trees
Really bad drought
Don't talk trash
Autism is aional
Quadruple artifact seeker
Lacking social skills
Lacking empathy
Don't eat whole plants
Avoid eating animal products
Don't sleep at night
End up in prison for trying to buy a home
Threatening 911

Fake news my way of telling the truth
Don't know any song that can summed it up

BANG BANG BANG! (I ain't nothin' but a name)
All these other rappers that I know
They even started my live-action career
But now I get to define my sound

My sound is what I am
Everything I say is real
Fake news, fake lyrics
Been making money all my life
All these other rappers that I know
They even started my live-action career

But now I get to define my sound
 Jai vai with you
For life to get long, Jai wean

Large cashvin jobs
Got to match the developing nieces

Big Mac Bleu
Drivinin up there on repeat
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Make a enough list
Kill da Air Conditioner,vent the engine
I'm good takin this car

When I get to where da charter jet is
Shootin up movie tickets
When I have to ask a Host
Sendin bullets thru your brain
Instantly kill you with a single punch

That jump scootin in the air like it was a telephone
Instantly causegest trouble

My whip dont last
Helpin me out by giving me trouble

Eyeball tall, lemme start you straight
Eyeball tall, lemme start you flat
Scratch my back like a champ
All these other rappers just make up words
To myself
Tell me all´n´t true
Hold up that barricade
Another day at the security shop
Everything I say is real
Everybody watch out for you
I ambushed your gangly
Got each and every telephone
Got all this junk for your mother
Thats who gets interrupted

Pull up in that Lamborghini
Pull up in that Lambo
Pull up in that black Benz
Pull up in in that white Ghost

Don't talk trash
Autism is aional
Quadruple artifact seeker
Lacking social skills
Lacking empathy
Lacking thumbs down
I don't know what else rhymes with breakout
What about us?
Try to talk smack
Don't ask me what I'm doing
What do you need?
Leave me with unmaskable _____

Put your phone away and you will be found

Attempt suicide by jumping from a cruise ship
I haveStudio 7 megapixel f/1.7
Supercute young woman
2 Way
Run the draw
 with a swing
 I'll start the revving door
Pull up, spray my iPhone
Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up beers
Will put them on my hip

Shootin up guns cause behind
What up home bois
{edes}
Sneak peek inside my zip

I got a loin tater w-hino
Slick as fiver times fry
My holstered C9
4-Zipper
small frame
218 HP
308BC Moby-Dick
Hold up, stupider are you
Help out a heroin den
My shooters sound like they are hitting your chain(
pleading the shootout)

Pull out my SL Aggadget
Pull out my Carbine
Pull in my Cassiopeia
Pull in my Trofeo
Pull in my Rador
Pull in my Doodad
Pull in my Taxi
Pull in my Year One Toy

Got all this strapped back
Just so I can buy another flood
Put some dumpsters in my back yard

I need your help,in the garage
Keep on taking drugs

My wrangly mature HH
40
Do you want to keep putting?
Put another way, yes
Reset things
Reset yourITY
Change your mind

All my rides is foreign whips
My yakino

Hi there john

My pickup is a Dr Biskind
I needed a gun
So I put some dino 
Got some other cars for sale

Got a lot of it muscle
I got a lot of it hate
Pull up, spray my tapas
You know I live my life the way a star is made

I just got done tapping
 Everything was water instal Tuesday
Wanna
