Got money, money, money, money
You know I always gotta keep an eye on her (bankrupt)
Cuz she even got me asking out on a movie (edition)

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I got a Murcielago on my wrist and on my neck
Im always super fly cause I own 7 private jets
I got more money in my back pocket than the IRS
Messin with my crew results in more than just a threat

I got 1, 2, 3, 4
Shootas at your front door
5, 6, 7, 8
Killas at the back gate

I got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

Pullin up in that spaceship
Cause I need my personal space
Pullin up in that M1
Got more guns than an Army base

Pullin up in that 911
Better get the hell out my way
In the glove I gotta Draco
Better get the hell out my face

Step inside my crib and its like -10 degrees
I got all this ice like I should buy a pair skis
I got all this paper like im cuttin down trees
Ca$h Floe viral
Yeah I spread like a disease

I been selling cocaine since I was like 6
I live inside a mansion and I built it brick by brick

I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
Ask me "Ca$h Floe how you get so sick?"

Everybody stop and starin
When im stuntin in the whip
You talkin bout your wooden floors
I pop you with my metal stick

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

Hi there kids
My name is Ca$h Floe
Im coming here today
To tell you not snort coke

Just lask week
Some guy came to me
And told me how his brother died
From smoking PCP

I don't need any purple in my cup
Cause taking drugs makes you dumb like Forest Gump
Drug are illegal, and doing them are bad
And every time you smoke weed it makes Jesus sad

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

What up home bois
The name is MC Mac
The truth is that taking drugs isn’t really wack

Don’t listen to Cash Floe
He never done blow
Therefore he don’t know
What’s coming from Mexico

It’s so good
It’s so tasty
It’s so fine
Funny thing is that their there all the time

Just hit up the dealer
He knows what you need
He da true healer
Try the tainted weed

The trips are the best
In the jungle with a cult
I feel really blessed
And now I’m a true adult

When I was an adolescent
I abused mucinex
Now finally all grown up
I smoke cigarettes

Adderall, ritalin, ecstasy, caffeine
I tried them all when I only was a teen

And look how I am
Do I look like a fiend?
Maybe so
You don’t know
Hold up, Imma do mo blow
