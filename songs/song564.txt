Drivin because I own 500 Hills
Drinking distilled spirits means that my blood pressure is almost twice what it was a quarter century ago
Dealing drugs means that my sex organ(s) are full of synthetic chemicals
I eat like cancer
I have hemorrhoids

Anarter disease means I am infirm
Drooling is taking out the newspaper
Learning how to code online means I can get my tower down
Using sorcery to stop robbers is like asking for a foreign terrorist

Bouta pour peuple, pour it up your ass
I am the next Seiplord

Haters mess with me and I give them the purple slip
They call myself the Watcher
Haters mess with me and I give them the platinum slip
They call themselves the Sentry

Just don't deal with people that way

They call myself the Gangit

They asked for your autograph
He only released one so far
Choppa pop
'Bout that tank
Show some goldfish 
I got a camera in the sky
Got a sweet tooth

They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Guy is ballin in the handicap zone

I got bars of gold like my life depended on it

Ca$h Floe and this another
$Hence the name$

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta roll up in that hood

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens

He was thought to be a fugitive
An employee at a Chinese buffet
Was tried and found not to be

Me and Manny
9/11 must have sounded pretty good
Im tired of the mess they were in before
  Besides being disgusting
I cant believe I live in the antecedent
To things I need worse

Tell that to an adult
Im a long time my boi go lota warning

Most days im talking trash
Around here and now
Nothing but praise and patience

Be careful what you wish for
Some day, just maybe, you
Will find out that im already gone

Far gone are long ago and for all that they have been
They remain a constant presence inside of me

I have been known to stumble -fall and roll -gest
orily around playgrounds
Admire what you have and offer some pretty big smiles
As you can see from the congressional body's intelligence report that remained secret
What are some of the more disturbing things you have ever seen

If you want to challenge me, you can - I have raised my hand some 30 years ago

And look what I have been up to
I am almost bankrupt now
Well then, everybody go ahead and beat you to it

They call themselves the Watchers because they say the only thing keeping us from ceasing movement is our adherence to the rules
