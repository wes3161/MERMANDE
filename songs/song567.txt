10,000 chance I land a headmaster prefix sm g (count 'ur advantages)


Ring ring thats yo crib
Drop that up like it's your chapter turn
My guns fire real loud
Prefer real estate more than any other profession

Another body to lean my shotgun in

I need a life preserver for when I need it the the
Most lethal ammo my cop squad box
Pull up, in the name of the, "the system",
Drop 32 dead bills on through the rear
I pop in the 'bringer's chain
Someone body bags me, taking with them the
Money

19 total brokers
I pop in to clear the way
The cashier checks
I gone,. . .
