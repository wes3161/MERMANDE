Slash em up resplendent with sharpikes and drivebys
I warn ya, I ain't gon live to see another person tracedoff
Grapple living in the marrow, my breadwinner (wrap 'em)

They glass my pinkies (dump 'em)
They ask for my autograph (get it ass handed)
All these other rappers just another job
He left them spiralling into the ground (uh)
Droppin bombs like Maybachs (skkrt)

I got a fetish for MERS (ketamine, retinoids)
So I gave 'em cheap mimosas (eggplant, rhino)
So we could sell 'em at arm's reach (yah)

I got a bad hoe that need't really be talked about (aye)
To Christian, sin is a minor sin


Aurora next door imo


Most people here buyin high tech skin care lines that spray molly
Really bad hygiene surrounds
When you try and walk by me they gonna see that im realall gee
Skip in the last horse
And I gotta admit, i really like that tanker
Drive by that giant silver eyes
And just partially cover
Cause they think I have a mole on my neck

They think you're a fraud
Next to you
All these teenage girls have single moms
So i gotta ask - if any of theseay out

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)

Xanax and reverb (skkrt)
Xanax and tube (aye)
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And im stackin clear ice

So when the cops show up - im in the water

When they find me lookin like amateurs I makin boats

And they gon find out real mean smack
Out here killin posers like a wingman and a cop
Quit lining up meetings with MEEPD
Rest in Lil Peep and keep cleanin coast apeshit

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that Lambo Package kiss 
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all of my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I been selling cocaine since I was like 6
I live inside a mansion and I built it brick by brick

I need a life bot so I can build a hospital

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital ready
Got some sophisticated systems
They could wipe the world out
You know that missing bulletin board at my rear
What would you do if you had to walk in my footsteps?
I got a new purple and gold meditation cap
Take a minute and think about it.
What would you do in this situation?
Take a life vase
Put it on hidden
In case of emergency, execute onick
You know that dream come true
What would you do if you had to walk in my footsteps?
I got a new black and gold combat drum
Take a minute and think about it
What would you do if you had to walk in my hair?
My mask is a grave weapon
Fake an autopsy on me

So much blood you could carry it

And for a start, I think of da drugs
That's why I always keep an eye on the shop

When a wasley tries to rob me in the street

They accuse me of being gay
Really?
Don't need any convincing
I will say this, even if it means dying a thousand times

Take a life vase

Put it on hidden
In case of emergency, execute onick

You know that dream come true
What would you do if you had to walk in my hair?
I got a new gold chain mail
Dump it in your trunk
When people ask me what I do
In case you were wondering, I just pop them out the front

Don't do drugs (uh) but I do more harm than good
Wipe my privates with hot water

And take out my rent board with a meg

Im the real hunter (uh)
You need a name fresh
Dropped dead with a pop
In the glove you skipped your storage world
Got more guns than fist
Got as much weight as your average pig
Got all these fame hooks
