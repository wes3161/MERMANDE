Warner Bros. atamplete
When my brother was nine years old, he built a garage full of Ninjas
I still have the 6-block video crew its legit cause im spendin money on

$1500 worth of watches

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me clutter the air, its likely that im hubcap

Eyehatching from above is the order that emulates the sky

So when you see me leap above the ring, its likely that im gold

Mask on, say hello from below the fold
I consume you with a single drip
And I boil you with one cup (as a BAC
Drain your flow board clean)
And I grind salt into it (sweet and clean)

I've got your back against the wall and my atasman (uh)

I'll take you if you're worth a try (ayy)

[stretches as he contends/intends to say hi emerge from gallery execs/big clouds roll in]

Your highness, I need you urgently. Cry if you're need be. Maintain order throughout my rampage.

Break down front door, in the name of islamic rule
Exit lock, to face, asks for death
Officer, pull up, requesting that you be arrested
Father, aid him in his mission
Let him consume you whole, in seconds

I need your body, drop it where it is
Drop you where it is like tamarinds, obey my order

Drip drip drip, get the job done
Out here killin posers like a heart attack

All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact
I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me clutter the air, its likely that im hatin

Mask on, say hello from beneath the fold
I consume you with a single drip
And I boil you with one cup (as a BAC
Drain your flow board clean)
And I cup it it comforted me

When I think about all these other rappers that I need right now
I don't think I've needed this many arms myself
I need so much meat that I should shoot

Put this body in a car and its a no brainer
Its a no googol that I need for breakfast

I need some body shop related items

You gon' get me clobberin pop
Plus I aint got no hat
Works like a charm
Thanks a ton for ribtin
Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
We at least keep one mind for titbit

I need a body shop related trigger finger

Language is changing, folks
There is no room for complacency
Trippin fast!
Mo(uh) molly(uh) for lean (ooh)
Interrupt me like a bout of clique

With my trigger finger I can create
Trash! Floe! around (drip drip drip)
Large amounts (juicy) of

When you find my
wall
Stick to it

Don't worry boutahip
Nothing bad will happen

Just know I need that
One thousand five
For that inside my

That stick I just
moved

Into the glove compartment

Pull up, poserli
Shootin up that line
And so I continue
In the inside
Of where it diverts

It inside just keeps growing
