I have found that taking the easy way and making it happen

I am pleased that so many people think I am them
I have been hailed as one the better angels of evasion

Wallet over chain and foot over the needle
Bout to lose as much as I can haul
Another profitable day, another profitable day for myself

Looking only at revenues
What you really need is more people

Everything you consume is engineered into your brain
