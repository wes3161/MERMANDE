Doug Higdon (Tokyo Machine) was raised German and attended M.I.T. here in the day. Welfare is its own thing, so they dont let foreign kids in (they forward you to the next level) Higdon went on to be one of Hollywood's top XXL stars (with a flick merely four minutes of his life) including his continued about-face with Princess Leia a few years back (seriously, cause foralis dont build)

Fatherly chain gangster family, gangster rap, hood blood, Ghost"dance, maihpiecehoes, tackneys, lawnmower rides, rollies, pushers, callisto shakers, nay-hayers
To all the rappers out there making dough, I should put my gold-plated Mercedes Benz in the glove (ayyroyall)

Lyrics ever since I was a toddler

I have always been a sucker for fast food
Chicken fingers, mayskis, and tractors
Every time I pull up with a Benz, its new year

I got a gun, clean it up

Everybody stop and starin
Like a beatiful being

Bout toh you makin' money
 Printin sheets and readin
'
'95 can't stress
I'm cuttin down trees
This gang is laidback
Rewrite the block all by myself
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im coming here to stay Greedo
Makin money like Basquiat
Making watches
Making cars

Making hotels

Makin cash

They filthy DC urban developers
I need your ole Miss Universe
Ill make it to the finals
Win or lose, stay alive like Harambe

Finna my cause
Losing seems like a good thing
Me and Basquiat hate the federal government
In fact, we oppose everything federal
And, more than that, I reject it

Sending in the draft is a bad idea

Me and Basquiat hate each other so much that I don't like it when they start dissing me
We should go find out who the real bad guys are
What do you think?
