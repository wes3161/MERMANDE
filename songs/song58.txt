Most rapin so far(5 am)
Money hoards, money im fresh
All my spare change is going to the bank
There is nothin but redundancy

Money grabbers, I'll just cash in the check
You cannot make this stuff up
They both swindle me and I rassle them

Some time in the future when youre homeless
They'll lend me your fuckin cash
Cash is like poetry, you can do better


Only a fool would take these words as true
That being said, we all
Weeb-limb, weche
Work in strip malls
And every once in a while
However, I always keep it onehunnid

Drive a seven-agreret-a-day
Drive an aperitif
Drive with a detour
Got a rig made of Heckler
Drives like an Acai

Some people have never broken any laws

Try as I may, there isn't any law that can beat me

They say hiphop is merely dancing
Dont try to separate us
We both know what you were thinking
By now you are almost ready
You are so na√Øve that you do not realize
The reasons for every song
You are such a unique crew
That it would be impossible to pair
To myself, with every song
You are nothing more than a dream

Fake rappers are real
Gucci bursting at the seams
Living with his gang
Breakout MCs like Me and Yo Ghost
Lacking and unknown to the rest of us

That would not be a disaster

Gucci bursting at the seams

Living with his gang
Breakout MCs like Me and Yo Ghost

Lacking and unknown to the rest of us

That would not be a disaster

Fake rappers are real

Messin with me all over the place

Fake mixtapes often
Lacking respect
To each other's ranks
Fake fly patterns so brutally that I almost
Droppin bombs like Nemo

I need a life preserver

Clean cause his body reacts like an atom
Clean
