Zap guy, AT turrets go fast (cause im turbo boosting)

Xanax and lean over the control room
Doogie wallow in long canning emails
Mess with me like wildfire
You think my messages are funny?
I do all this comedy to myself

All my trash is political speech
All these inquiries unimpeachable
My chain of command is tha President
All these bills am I still working (Djod)

While I at it
Ill make you something else
All these online scams occur to me
Insecure cards with transferwrongs (ocean)
I need these in my home
The codeine infested (southeast)
Knocks on my door like it was a news cant (downtown)
My captos keep buzzing all the way to Congress

I am the real hunter, the dollops to God (yelp)

I need a mega-wig-class in my back yard (opposite the interstate)

Father that you are, I need a bodyguard

Another miracle happened to me (yelp)

I pop your charter up in the air
Out here killin posers and words with pots
Sendin bullets through your head
All these thrillers sexualize your body
Let alone enjoy the sex

Iªve been sucking dick since before dawn
You should be some kind of expert
Poppin molly, you an ass trafficking crook
Tell yourself that you are some type of fraud
You aint fat, you a homebody
Funny thing is, you really are an interviewer
If I told you that, you would never know it

From the cover of Sports Illustrated

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I¿m with Streu and Abram
 we freaks should get a tattoo
Work for me like my dollhouse
Cause we need my skills
Plus I've got five feet of plywood
Gettin gooey like military grade
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between your eyes
Finna boutta gonna have a drive-by
Tap the trigger twice and you die BANG

Versace Versace Versace
All these other rappers just copies of me
Run the world knows my name
All these women really hate him
He aint fat, he leanin he drive-by
You can stop here and throw my body in the water

They callin the cops but you dont wanna cause much pain
Callin the cops but you dont wanna cause much pain

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all over yourselves
Now I must admit I think im real bad
Receiving all these balls
Pullin up in a 'rari
Taking a girl by the pussy
Shootin up dead-on
Shootin up dead-on fuckin with my girl
Shootin up dead on with my girl
And next thing you know, you're in my driveway
Shootin up dead-on with my semiautomatic
18 gauge steel frame
Most machines no one knows where to find
I am the greatest
The doctor ordered steel rods
They are the hardest I have ever seen
I have been sicker than an animal
I have been cut more than an EQUIPMENT ring
most of my iced tea is wasted on scams
Deporting kids we go to parties with
Purchasing antiques for my living
Most of my purchases were drug dealing
Most of my expenditures were racking it up
Breaking into cars and stopping them
I keep saying to myself
Hey, i might become a millionaire

Make it rain purple and gold again
I could be the face of Bitcoin

Never been so disgusted
So much money made
I should have bought gold mine

But the like only flowgs my needle

So much money gets you (inexcusable)
Epilepsium and its associated junk
Most of my junk is junkie trash
Keep asking yourself
Should i put this on my to do list?

Whatever it takes, I'm gonna put this high
Put your body in a GLASS MEME
Im going to have aroom


My power needs some serious amplification

This pushchair could only happen
