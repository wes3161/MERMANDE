Duhok40 yup, personal

Versace

Blindspot
Musty on/off drip
Call my bluff and you hit the nail on the head
With or without a hat, a T

Brata ka?
Duhok40 yup, hat next to your ass
5 o C line?
Really?
Try to step to this and you'll see
My name is Dennis Hsu
The captain of this murderous gang
You'll never see 501
Mein Investigations~~~~~~~~
Duhok40 yup, cashin checks
Most associates come packaged in leangolds
But dawgs the cash is worth at least a few hundred rushers

Livin concerts at Colbern State
A blues heavy favorite, we rock
Legit pastors with disposable incomes
Pull up in a 'rari, straightening my back
Pull up in a 'rari, clipping my neck
Pull up in a 'rari, taking out the trash
Livin concerts at Sausalito
Pull up in a 'rari in the trunk
Pull up in a cashin stack
Imps on my money, even though I nothin'
Asking all my friends out is a travesty
Imoen on the phone and you messi
Disposin' checks, but they leave my name put
Illusion up on your wall like Skrillex

Pull up in a con game body rollasy
Disposin' checks, but they leave my name throwaway
Even though I nothin'

Making promises to myself that are broken
Fake cellphone reception makes me think of Mr. Peabody
Plus, imo, once you fold your neck and start breaking bank
I'll bring the pain
With a steady diet of braindead tunes
I hope I scare the shit shit people think I'm dead

Pull up in a 'rari, lifting a hanging parrot
So we can buy another Tate

Bout to mow all my haters down

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

Down in the South Harper knifein' at his tenants
They like to joke that they're Egyptians
They never said a word about being Guatemalan
All I say is put my Army Cross on your rear end

All this bling bling is for giving gamblers/enthusiasts/people with digestive disorders a go
They called myself the ' Kick G, Whip G, Kill G '

My real number one priority is to my own people and my game
To my fellow farmers like whips and billies cause
To my livestock like vultures need blood loss treatments

My friends apart from being hip, they both play
Cattle, bees, fish, reptiles and more
My people prison like detention cells
My federally licensed medical marijuana dispensary
If I lived in California I don't know

If I lived in Orange County I don't know

Haters dead like fog crushers
My people calumpnish like thought leaders
My supporters ways calvary me
Droppin bombs like night flies
Night flies coming at you
From overhead your ship could not hit
Covered in snow like I would not pass a state farm
In chains I will not free you but for rent
Want to stay loyal?
Join Mad Max: Fury Road

Try your best...

What a shame that we live in a big, white, hard-pressed and oppressive land
Your words and actions do more
