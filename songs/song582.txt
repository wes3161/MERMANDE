FER DASHH,  
Ring ring a gush a four pegasus a beat (yuh) 
Pull up in a 'rari
You want to play roulette?
Ask me Yin or Yang
I bring that YAL MONEY
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz
Then I pull up in the rari
With my shooters you'll be sorry

My armory, expansive
My catapult aint passive
Tha barret is be massive
My draco is jurassic

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Lipity loppity
momidy robbity
 tongue so floppity
hippity hoppity
 Me llama you a comedy
IQ bring homogeny
 words long verbosity
Looking for a mamatree
Got five doggie -ees
Made 100 milli Gs
Got cash floe reppin T’s
My hoe got sum lean
My body wants to pee
Leaking the 7 seas
urine smells like codeine
Really bad hygiene
To myself im real mean
I hate the rap scene
Fake rappers are memes
Gucci bursting at the seams
Clean as heck make wet dreams
Jet fuel can't buy fat
 Soda cans are like drawls
Drug dealers keep depicting us as monsters
This gang of trippies isn't funny, sugar
They pull out all of heroin, resulting in pills
Pop cans are like outbreak barges
I overdosed on nick n' pop
 I got a temper like Plain old rari
Fake weight, overbuilding
If I died, nobody would ask me to rob them

Im reppin at your barber shop
I hate the rap scene

Fake rappers are memes
Gucci bursting at the seams
Clean as heck make wet dreams
Jet fuel can't buy fat

So what am I saying?
Try to be funny, but you cant - im what im trying to say

I got a temper like Plain old rari
Fake weight, imbecile
If you ask me, im excellently trained
I will place whipped cream in your hair
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm never funny, I'm always telling the truth

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist

Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist

If you want to fight, go ahead and persist 
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil

While buying me more clothes than a block party
Drip drip drip
Dispose like ukuleles
When im running the sprinkler
I'm like a speedo at 12 hours dreck
Throw my weight like a pole voodoo (skkrt)

I keep on ritually racking your brain (yuh)
Every day since I was a teen (woah)
Poppin at the top of his lungs (yuh)
Lookin at my gills (yuh)
Choppin at my belly (woah)
Every day for like four hours (yuh)
I keep on ritually racking your brain (yuh)
