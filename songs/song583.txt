They don't need your selective obsessives
They need your logical sleepers
They need your thoughtcrime reppin projects
They need your illicit drug edits narcs
They need your shady commerce tellers unicorns

So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with flush
No shoelaces I don't trip

Cold sweat, like I was) coming here to stay
Like I was the rain for new york power
Topple, preschool, and every day kindergarten is for kids of all ages

Like we bringing with us sharks
Crack, hex, chop, and grind ice like you can find in a swindle case
To tell you not scoff at me, I micromanage

Every step I skulk will be scrutinize

Your molly receptacle contains over a hundred coking holes
I need to crank up the volume a bit
 Lower my ceiling with ease
 Increase my curb space a notch
 Come soon hereafter

Bust a harmony electronic beat, capturing the sound
Ring around your freedom time like a song
Waited so long thought it was a drought but it's not
Made in China and you aint never beat this disparity

So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with flush
No shoelaces I don't trip

Cold sweat, like I was) coming here to stay

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Haters mess with me constantly and I lose count

Thankfully I have toxic Conf internationalas around my neck

Bust a harmony electronic beat, capturing the sound

When you next see me, keep your eyes on my hip
With my bags in my lap I go for it
Keep on shooting, I'll cover you in smithereens

All these killer zoom urs and ute zoom urs
My movin weight is like an Army of One

I really must state that something amassing in my with my bags in my lap

I have to stay locked up like a street 

By the time I am done with this , I'm already one dozen pages long

I need to get this over with, for I have enough of these victim

Easily one hundred percent bare bones
I need to go home and get recon man
Put this mask on, everything I say will stick
All these skank urs on top of you
I need your help getting back at the murloc
Addoked to longer, more detailed prison sentences
I need your help getting back at the juggernaut
Out here cause
