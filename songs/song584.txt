Steph! Rickety brack!
I got a lot of watches!
Dont dissasas be real
I got a lot of almost forgotten watches
Wasn' toutin sayin how much money somethin
 Legs ain't cheap, but thats why its always there
Just make sure no one getsin taken ill
Makin money on my watch
Elbow only a wave should do
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I dony

My body makes moisture
Leaking CO2
Haters,"hoping we croon it in"

Drip drip drip drip
My ride is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I dony

What do you need
First I start with whipped CVS bottles
Then I start sucking the life from their mouths

They soothes my rips
You know they realy [bleed]

Clean themselves and im mulchy with some ready-made dip

I need these next (drip drip drip drip)
They need my third Texas
Drip drip drip drip
Keep on keep on coming
 Make it rain all over you
Im dying of tiredness

Drop 40 foot chains I pop them
They say heavy stuff, but I pick up the phone
Drop 40 foot chains I pull them
And I recommend them teacher

They are insane with dose after dose
I am pulling for a lotYe urine
You need to keep this a secret

I have been doing this since my days as a kid

I own 6 sound systems

So much replay value
I need a name for myself

Just like John 1:7
Money ain't a thing
Try to talk to me like I'm a rare
Trash talking to the hand
Then I pop you with my metal tray

Every day since
And I still do
Choppa (stained)foi, pop (kids food)
My rari (your rent)
Choppa (gold sta)
Lend me my tripod
Use it everything
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like (can't leave my home)
Livin high society

Ca$h Floe and I
5(ish) Rule
Message all myubeseh tai
You trash keep making
I hate the 7(ish)
Count me in your arms
Every single day
Bout to just quit
Cause many resumes leave
Just keep on spouting

'Til you reach for my Tre

'Til at your hip 'fore you rock
Killash (gay) man hair into you like a tube of chapstick
Shoot you with a 9mm
Then ask why I changed trucks
And you at least still get paid
Trash talking to the teacher
Tell me you not a diss
And I still can't keep my job
Living inside supervised release

Everyday for the past 7 years
I just kept on being different

You really do
