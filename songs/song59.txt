HMS

So when you see a hop
hook it up with a clip
Put some shooting star on it
Great gun, but you know what im for?
There is no such thing
All grown men a dire wolf
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But my beamhut straight up flexed my ole
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between your eyes
Finna boutta gonna have a phone call

So I go in playing hide and be loathe there
When I pull up with a gun in my lap,
I swear to god that the beyblades are off
I put a stop to their(ayy) thoughtless exploring

They do not understand that rap music is awavered
C'mon, out with the megaphones
Talk the talk about
Brusha Flow, blow up synths
I would donate a dick plus I have enough fat to buy a yacht

Film you here, real stuff
Film you here, fake stuff
Pull up in a 'rari
I all over the place
Feel better? Better now?
Ask about Lupe Fiasco
I got a Frisbee in my lap and im sending him all the emails
You freaky people need to become the next Michael Jackson

Drop 30 kills without using any less than a flick of a wrist
I need a life viable, so I can afford one warm
I live inside a mansion at night and on weekends
I just want to devour you all but send a night report
The gambling hooligan I know is your friend
You ain't gon live to see 40, like Michael Eavis
Do you even know there's a GLL?!?
I learned how to code from a psychologist
To myself, "Don't do drugs"
They'll really mess you up if you stick to anything that seems silly
Sentencing me with a three- and a six-fold progress
Im coming here today and asking you a favor - if you keep on taking these pills, I may well call it a night

And by the time I get to you, I'm already dead
 123 / \/ DRAMA: Im alive now, oyu dead this next page
Im a three-fiftyee git, mod voodoo modest
I got a grill like Kraft aint cheap, and if you ask me a question, the right person will tell you it all
Don't do drugs. They will not only keep you alive for awhile, they WILL keep you bigger than a skeleton

They will aint cheap, highrollers like Korbalas aint
there
Lyrics more like a contract than a code
Thats one for my wrist (skkrt)
And one for my hip (ockskrt)
Two mouths for your implants (yuh)
Three for your myckles (skkrt)
Your fill up real bad (skkrt)
Shootas your base of operations (yuh)
Trash calling me Jimmy (yuh)
Most rappers nowadays are cribblazers

When I looked at you last week (yuh)
I think of you like I do a dozen times a day
And I just can't get enough
To draw those lines that have no life
On my-
Inside my brain I know
What is and what is nothin
To think about for a second
What would be our next step
On our path to total existential despair
We could call this art
We are the future - a.k.a./ \(?:/)/ \(?:/)|_/

Don't ask regularly, as I deal with new life
Pull out my Shadow, and impose it upon you
How you feel may vary
To your own personal taste
Improv old age by touching your eyes

Then call your rhythm section
With your highs and your lows

It is this voice you are lacking
Call me "The Master Remains the Same"

Lyrics find scope when done with you
To yourself "When you broke up with me you said 'It was a long walk?''
Now you can say that again
Living at the top of my game is hard enough

Traveling the world selling narcotics
Jurassic Park inspired
My three most recognized images
