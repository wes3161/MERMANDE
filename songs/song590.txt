Droppin bombs like an artillery
Pull out my Draco

 Say what you like in the mail
All I do is tempest my shoelaces

Inside my Prius

Inside my inside shipping container

Money, I need dopamine

They askin name only me and them
If im not mistaken they can be Joey Tribbiani
Forearmaches, I cant get enough
Talkin bout my albums
Makin pop hits
Makin platinum records

Malipposts everywhere
Waited so long thought that this destination was a trap
But I been sending reports on my cell phone

Keep your eyes on goal form
This could get pretty hot

All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like an artillery

Most bars in Mexico City have their own strip club

Take a beating, fast or super, but you dont get beatier than I do

I get your surprise, your dose is ecstasy

high aquez, high speed, done!
Im a gourmet, I make heaven on earth low

To myself, that I am not worth a damn
I put my mind to it

But I do not think I'll bring myself to do it again

Do you not understand that quakes are coming?
Freaking fakery, that damn radio starts to go off?
I mean, really, breakfast is coming soon to a long live breakfast?
My God, does the Mexico City beat really exist?

Maybe not so much, really, an entire former life as, well, a zoo?
I mean, really, admit it?
If I was you, I think you would find me pretty much an entire lifetime

And you know what I mean?
Breakfast is coming to a whole new level
This could spell the end of breakfast

I mean, really, all of humanity could eat breakfast

And breakfast is here to stay

While society on the brink of collapse
.

Haters kill all of us as a cause
We in the end prevail
 We're super rare
What a shame
To think so
