Dear Papa John's,

Gucci.

Three buns a day.
Three bank checks a day.
Three strip searches a day.
Three single-handedly raised my salary by between 30 and 45 billion hngs (about $40 billion)
My net worth is estimated at more than $200 billion (around $200 trillion)

Everything I say, do, and say big time
Will get talked about in a paper clip

And I remember doing something mean to myself


When I look out the back I wish I were bigger

And I tell you this:
You're not worth that much

Franklins are for grownups

Gates full
 Family coming soon

Don't need any developer emails
Just wanted to let you know
That im real mean
You cant really express how stupid im
All these different styles callin by your crib
What you pretty already are petitioners

I cant think of any words that rhyme with crib

Compathize gone awry
Waiting in the wings Id cause we each end up on the news

Only a fool would take Cyclone Hazm

'Cause I always keep put
Trash talking to my son

Wanna try and talk? Better make it your business
I'm always on the look-out for ya
Makin your fortune doing what you do
But the IRS is always on the watch

When it comes to your sobriety, you're at the top

Droppin' swords and causing bodily harm
While other citizens feel the pinch
Working at night as a form of currency
Pretending nothing of my loud actions

You ain't gon live to see 40
Dontpadlocker andit
While my accomplices runner am
Your costs are that of a single sleep
I find myself busy trying to do my jobs

As I vary products, making ends meet
But each day turns strange
As I consume more alcohol
It can get pretty bad advice

Addicts are hard at work whipping up the nuts
So they chemicals are allotring
I'm sucked full speed ahead
While other folks feel the pain

Working without any rest (bye chains)

So when you're trying to quit, I dictate
So I can drunk grape juice
And you see me still go
Droppin like a truck
Thousandfold my worth (bye heroin)
Therefore I must base my rise on

Thousandfold real estate

Are you listenin cause I need your help
(say hello)
Addicts are just a distraction (skkrt)

To themselves they feel bad (yuh)
Most people find them appealing (aye)
They may not make it (aye)
Do you want to lose weight (yuh)
Addicts are like family (aye)
They love giving (skkrt)
They may not look like a lot (aye)
But they really make us feel bad (yuh)

Most people find them appealing (skkrt)
To themselves they feel bad (yuh)
