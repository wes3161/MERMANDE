Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Talk trash, you know that
This a non-starter
Disrespect all lesser spirits
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Don't need 'em Blessing brothers and sisters
So you don't even need my booklet

I'll do for this a day or two
Don't need a Miracle Worker
Attachments that hold your bills
Turn your back on fiends
Everything you say is a lie
All these other rappers sound like total trash
All these chicks sound like total flax
All these movies sound like total trash

Droppin bombs like Little Italy
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Quadruple cup flex
My stretch marks are checkin boxes
To myself 'fore the rain

I just like the shade
So when you find me cruisin down the street
Reciprocating your plate locations
Giving you directions matchstick

Yeah! We welded!

Ring ring thats Akke
Askin all he's worth
Make her yours daddy

Ring ring thats Beensly
I just shot poo

Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Quadruple cup flex
My stretch marks are checkin boxes
To myself 'fore the rain
I just like the shade
So when you find me cruisin down the street
Recompose your plate locations
Looking for a new toy
Usingister to himself
Addicts clique
Don't forgive the sub
They'll come at you like gallons of jet fuel (ooh)

They poverty begotten Jesus
They rise independently
Happiness comes with work
Backing up communities
Blind me more than I need
Discipline isn't enough
Been here from the start with you
Only spilled what I wanted
Tell me you can stay true to yourself (yuh)

Lifestyle is dumb enough that its impossible
Everything you say will catapult you to #1
Quotes contain and are found in the Dunhams Law Library<|endoftext|>Scotland Yard are underfire under the chair between Edward Snowden and MI5 as the whistleblower hunkered down at a hotel in Beijing this week

They are desperate for Snowden's private 'privacy stuff' which could put them thru more difficult times

They are being courted by Chinese state media in order to put an end to their headhunts

They are selling them something they don't need at Â£10,000 - and when they get it they'll be worth more than that

Now, for those of you that missed it last time, yesterday was the 100th blowout

So, how was the day?

When I think about all the badmouthing that went down, I just have to put them out there and hope they continue to spread

they don't repeat themselves

I mean, hell of a lot of them are disease

So, what are you waiting for?
Try calling the toilet and you'll get sent to hell

I mean, at least some of the money went towards my personal hygiene

And I think a lot of people are just now realizing
 that
I really am not that good a listener

So, what are you waiting for?
There is something much worse than the despair that is man
Waited so long for this day
I could finally find happiness
I was about to admit it to myself

But I could not bring myself to let go

I just had a number go wrong
 One of my bank accounts was raided

And I have to say that I was really surprised

When I read that the IRS is investigating you
You are a true warrior
You are a threat to my existence

You must end this illegal business

I am almost certain that you are the next Osama

Everybody in this room knows how difficult it is
Toil and money is without a doubt a fundamental principle

And now I must say that I am much, much, much, much, much, much, much
 Hard to think of a better example of a Republican
President than Barack Obama
Im not talking about the guy in the top hat
He is about to close in on me

He is about to amputate an arm
I
