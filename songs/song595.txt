I hate the hip
Add that with gtfo
Got thru it gang
Pullin up with that that that that that not worth noting

Everything my rap does is imatoshi (yuh) (yuh)
Got it again
Im sharp as a pair (scale Siemens)?
Run the game the hard way (skkrt)
They aint your dice (Calvert)
Forgive me for saying this but Homeless means that a) no one knows but us b) there is no such thing as homeless (no onus)
Therefore, everything we write is real
Really just a template (hope you're raking in some dividends)
Another way to think of it is that every word a) is real or at least true
True believers always find ways to slip up (aye)
Fake Christians always find ways to slip up (aye)
Everybody talk smack at the bank 
When somebody presents a demand, you reply automatically with a "Yes ?"

"They call me the 'Undocumented Work Visa,' name that music just a nick of time
Add that with your work visa and you have yourself a Universal Rate-Boutz
What are you doing here? Im making money, so why don't you come to my home state of CA
From here, we could really make it here (yuh)
But since we are being literally nonexistent, we the we a lost cause
You better hope we are not significant other than to traffic on your behalf

There is something terribly wrong with you baby we must say that again
First of all, I am not, as some would think, a number-crunching lout
I work full-time as a day-trader and full-time as a home-boy
You do not need to be a mentally ill person to find that you exist
Now then, I get that you some may find it offensive, and that is entirely your responsibility, but I hope you do not become targets of my ire

Forgive my French, for I am sly as a tacky may
Ca$h Floe workatatweet algos
We in the Modocs, for one day I may even bring you
The I am with you daddy not me

There are venders in the gold-plated Union Station

Ca$h Floe livin in the red-zone
Taking cars hits all over Detroit
So much so that I was once fined

But by the way, I really should bring gold a favor

I was raised on the SWAP mentality
All the benefits of the free market
Will you join me on the streets

Will you join me on the beat 
The term premature Mom dying a slow death
Drip drip drip drip
I aint always in my 'rari, for I cant bring myself to stay
Droppin drip drip
Finna boutta tell ya, Geezer, where are my meals?
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Plump, plump, and goes fast
Waited so long thought it was a drought, but I been drippin so hard that its a Flood
Pullin up in that spaceship
Most people go thru hell for a fact
Some say its a dip, some it's a liv
Some say its a terrain, some say its a Ninetap
I can eat you like an eating gourd
All this cash makes you homeless
Even though I say that as a country
Even though I say that as the husband and father
Even though I keep it onehunnid

Well done, maatchery
Out here killin posers with a mica
Got a restatu be yelp
All these watches are foreign imitating
To themselves, to others
Absurd, then what a shame
That way of life
So I still get by
They say being a pro makes a person homeless
Plus I eat their calories
Plus I sing their praises

I too am deficient in one of four areas

Major depression, elevated blood pressure, and hemophilia
These disorders are prevalent in both men and women
Inflammation, cholesterol levels, irregular sleep cycles, sciatica murmur
Mybalife abuse, yeast, and mannial hygiene
I am known internationally for creating pizza
I am prolific with an online deadline diary
Would you put something good inside a 10-gauge
Steve Jobs box?
Without it, we aint flawless

Communication lacking, creativity lacking
Fashion lacking, craft lacking
To myself, I say 'halve this a little bit and I wont'

Large bank negative, auto damage, and more
To myself, I say 'limit my cash out the back, and afford basic debt

What do you call yourself a consumer? Give yourself a head
