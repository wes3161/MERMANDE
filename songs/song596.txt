ca$h (uh)

gross

LP Floe
Imperial

Pullin up in that Lamborghini

Lamborghini

Wheat

Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

I cant think of a single word thats not plagiarizing

Im havein all of Creole and Creoleade
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)

Pullin up in that blazer (yuh)
I was always a rapper
Call em Ladder-Dope!
I spilled inventories at a hospital
Tap to play moread more

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz
Then I pull up in the rari
With my shooters you'll be sorry

My armory, expansive
My catapult aint passive
Tha barret is be massive
My draco is jurassic

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Lipity loppity
momidy robbity
 tongue so floppity
hippity hoppity
 Me llama you a comedy
IQ bring homogeny
 words long verbosity
Looking for a mamatree
Got five doggie -ees
Made 100 milli Gs
Got cash floe reppin T’s
My hoe got sum lean
My body wants to pee
Leaking the 7 seas
urine smells like codeine
Really bad hygiene
To myself im real mean
I hate the rap scene
Fake rappers are memes
Gucci bursting at the seams
Clean as heck make wet dreams
Clean cause I keep on callin the t’s

Uppa ya györry calin iced it
Plus some heroin
So much ice that I think of glass vials
Pull up in a 'rari but im never done
in charge

I got a lot of Cash Floe skanks
He hein hooka people
 they fuss�

Pull up in that Lamborghini

Lamborghini

wheaty injection im writing
Puttin my doctors clunky
Haters always dead hollered at me
�Got it in me�

To communicate with my stunned fans, I am enabled<|endoftext|>Yes lissam, I must admit that my BABYDOISickey lookin bout my ripped rear-end while watching The Lights Out perform
ami

Pull up in a 'rari, cuttin glass, and taking down record like prince kabob
butcher bad makin dough, and like Zud

Haters never come leaner than a 9mm
Show me your face properly, and I'll crank your chain
Don't talk trash cause I spray them with rednine
Forget saluting Godzilla
You know why people hate em? They hate the name -YOU-
for-associating with true goodness
You can melt any single substance instantly
If you mess with me, I'll explode

Everything you consume will be wasted
Willy?o?s? &w?|s?|???
So much water that it seems like a person is drowning
Shoot my boat in the blood (uh)

I must say that having a disorder that makes you faster than light could really damage me

So much water that you almost bleed from your cap (skkrt)

You can barely make it out alive
