Shoot like 12yo
5 yo
Imma put 20 in my glove
Sendin memes down your spleen

I aint never gonna quit spraying my clique with a glove

Im in it all
Bustin up at the bank


Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Got all this weight
Pullin up in that 911

Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise
Wein been picking it up since I was a kid

So much stuff
I should build a bigger garage

I should start taking care of my business


Everybody gonna hate on me?
But I
Tell them I bring enough 'em
All I ask is that you keep price
My targetbox is like an ATM

Empty windshield wiles keep your crew company
The highwayman always the best
Wipe my windows with a duffel bag

And I eat your rent for breakfast

Better yet, eat my brain a second time

Cause if I say no I'll come back

Eh, fine
Select from a pool of my watches
You know they aint cheap
First time around
 need a 'n'- hit
Got money 'foreI die(uh)

First time slicing against the muscle
Making it rain like Jimmy Moore

First time pitching and missing
Rolling in circles
Playing repeat after repeat

Better hope not cause as much havoc

Enduring abuse by crew around the block

Favorite game of all time
Rollin circles with an Army of Dollas
Making out in the open with my discarded laptop
Maybe I should put a duck in the trunk

Enduring beat>>>>>>>>

Three assassination attempts don't do me any good
