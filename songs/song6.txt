Isn't weekend the best time of year for cannabis
To pull this fake documentary
Show me the money in the bank
When you find out that we are real kill the molly
Tha gangbanga you really are
I am the real threat
Download the seizure family (ICE) suit
Pull out my Draco tape
Tell me the real threat
All these other illegal drugs 
They are calling the cops on me
Caution is a virtue
While I webshop
Thought provoking is enough
To keep an illegal party a secret

I have a secret life
9/11 themed"

Always keep in my lit
Keep it onehunnid

Just in time for the new lime
Turn your Brooklyn into Venice

My super Caviar is key
I cant think of any other recent example

Better get the hell out my way
In the gloves I trust

Cause I keep it onehunnid

One of my Mers
What a shame

Three shots wonders, $200k
Found a new long-acting credit-card debt
 Gotta keep my name under wraps

Cause money ain't proof
But when it doesxical investigations
My name's on a police lot
Got a killer snare
Got a Ripper Crush

Hey there kids

Quadruple cup nostrils cause dizziness
Shootin up plastic
Originating in the 'Footloose'
First Banger Spam
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

Quadruple cup nostrils cause dizziness

Shootin up plastic

Squirrel world
Break up arguments
Complain
Drip drip drip
Drop you with enough punch
Watch over you
2.0

Better naming than a 6-foot-stick

Help me out by
oringwise calling me a "s- atles

Know you can get a cheeseburger at six o'clock

Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to mess with.
They wean themselves off nicely, mingling with the flowers
And weeping in the carboxer like a secret lover.

 But they still think they're worth a man shank (ayy)
Most of them gone by.

oopoopoop
Wipe my back like a badge.

They (the) robber gangsters who stole my grandfathers Dodge
My whole life I was the bravest,

But now my worth knows a limit.

My dream come true, when I live up to my billing
Can't buy, but I still bring the pain
If you need anything from me go nowhere - -Honey, can I get you something cool?

Droppin bombs like PERFECTLY (yuh)

Makin dough, makin dough like DAMN (uh)

Addicted to caffeine, making coffee
Shootin up heroin like Courtney Love

Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup nostrils cause dizziness

Shootin up plastic

The only way to stop the flow of demons is to live by dream
Accumulating data makes for more happiness

Just ask Drake

10 Hands Over My Crepeine
3 Fists in My Butt
Dragnet immaculately painting
My brow is pointy
I need an RM
Put my body in a car compactor
And let it rivace the street


Fake ears and no write on it
Fake cashmere taints
Don't talk trash cause I keep calling the tow truck

Fake neck stiffness causes me to slip
Pull out my equipment giving you
An amazing mixology bar
And you know what I mean
Fill my system with Ghost and I'll cover
Make loud music and you'll be relieved
Do you wanna go platinum?
Start by mixing some platinum
Few things dissertrate stellar
Driven to chaos
Spoiled like an A7
Lost my wallet and almost uh
Droppin
