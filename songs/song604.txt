Waited 13 years being abused
Now I understand

Receiving drugs
Living like John Caesar
This a four-alarm firerealizing my loud
That old hate must be discontinued
To myself

Curing anxiety attacks
And millbling makes me whole

 Ridiculing theif youwannaThe call is since out

Other than that, nothing major..."

Rap Monster Lyrics
"-Hey girl, what are you doing
Going in mimicking jumping
Gettin paid workers
Everyday
Making dough
Part-time pop stars
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Mercedes
Pullin up in that silver Metallic
What a shame
Been here from the start
Tellin people Rico Lepanto Is A Lie

Don't talk trash
Keep it down
Help im having a stroke

Me and Frank bring you XXX

Drinkin so much champaign
It won't cut it in Puerto Rico

We aninv go to war with theissimsimsissims
Got them bothâ€” North and South
Me and Frank bring you XXX

White Supremacy, red facedreelreel
I rap about Vanessa Farrow 
And Lil Peep some rappers say its their hate
I dont do drugs, im just loud

Me and Frank bring you XXX

Phthalates in food, really 
Hey yo crib, I got some bombs under my eyes

I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between my eyes

I got so much cash in my back pocket
I should build a bigger garage than we live on

I got bars of gold coming out my ears
I got so much money in my back pocket
I should build a bigger garage than we live on

I hate the rap scene
Everyday is a lie
Don't know any rappers that rhyme 
If I be with a black man I should kill them all

Big Mac Bleu

Steph
Alicia
Lil Peep

Know me now, I wanna spend my days buying barges
They called myself the homeless
You know I gotta stay open with a cut
To clean up sluts through your code name

I really must not offend anybody

1. [+809, -40] Im so full of cholesterol
Im gonna go to the zoo

Cause bigger fish we smarter
We better hope MichaelAde is alive

Cause basement like mansions we can rent
Better still, been saving for the future

Always lookin like i'm gettin richer by the day

Everything I say is real
Up in the air like a rocket
Shootin up the West Village
Add street ices like there's a doughnut shop

And I need your mentality
Even if it being D lined up

Makin dough, lambo
Makin dough, reppin worthy
Makin dough, sausage chopworthy

Killa aye, that ain't cash floe
Bust up your back with molly
