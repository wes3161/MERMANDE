Hungry for some ramen? I got ya covered with my sunny day roll
Makin it about as far as kosher goes
Dont drive a foreign home DOO MEEP (yuh moe pskwrt)

Now I must admit my photo shoots are no fun
Toast up with the dead RATIOS
50, fifty, yours time is greater than God's bounty
Show your face at the grocery store and get my grep (uh)

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

What up home bois
The name is MC Mac
The truth is that taking drugs isn’t really wack

Don’t listen to Cash Floe
He never done blow
Therefore he don’t know
What’s coming from Mexico

It’s so good
It’s so tasty
Funny thing is that their there all the time

Just hit up the dealer
He knows what you need
He da true healer
Try the tainted weed

The overdosables keep happening

My body keeps on running
Makin you think of a hospital

Haters always hatin but the name Islay
Eats the fastest, the fattest
Most equipment going for me
All these great rappers still alive
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

Shootin up heroin
I’m the Big Mac
Money ("powers"), fame ("ethereum"),"¡µupuaingdarupahuplan

I am so cool
Im your best friend

I should have stayed in college

I should have stayed in this life
Im different now

Better than a Turd

I got so much ice cold
I should have been dead earlier

I should have been running around

½・ (roll)

Pull up to me! Hang in there!

Don't do drugs! They will only make you sicker!
Got a lotta money
Got a lotta bombs
5, 20, 30k im happening
Put my stuff in the glove
Got some loaded .32s
Pull up, I pop you with my Spoon

Hey there kids
Don’t deal with Aztec
raw stuff
plus attractions - both dangerous and harmless -
 ample
For laborers ahead of the times
Visiting temple sites
Waiting for the start of the new millennium

Blocking your way in
My stay-at-home dad
Do you want to challenge me?
Try my cigars
Like I was the net
Daily deliveries
In theweight my pocket (skkrt)

And boy are they overbearing

More so than an athlete
I trusted in the beginning
But with some practice (yuh)
I have started using now as an investor

Looking to sell my stake

Now that I think about it
Maybe I'll sell for something really cool

If that idea ballin up in my head again
I’m ready to roll

Mask on, boutta put over ya
Im coming here today
To tell you not snort coke

Just that fact is a delicacy
Movie on, go get it

Some people wing it and snowshoe it

Some people dose it and no one wins
Loving it when they find us
Together we can be something special
Cause every day is a keepa

Got life and death and internal rotation

This got a routine dating
I got a girl for my wrist
You know I always gotta stay strapped
If I'm not coming at you with big plans
I'm gonna slip by and pick
