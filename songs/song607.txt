Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash

Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They askin where im from and what im talking bout

Got the stendo clip and I aint never play around

Better watch what you say fore I snap
Roll up on yo crib and we go brat-a-tat-tat
Thats one for your head two for knees three for your back
Always keep in mind that snitches always come in last 

Blindin people with my rims when I roll down the street
Resturant bill be longer than a CVS receipt
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?

Everyday im out here grindin stackin up that paper
You still got yo money roll in your ass
Finna boutta trash? Ill put my crib up for grabs
I got a different pair of trainers for each day of the week

Everyday im out here hustlin cans defeat yard signs

Fake release letters from China still copying stuff down
What would you do in a heartbeat if you had to walk in my shoes?
I got a different pair of street shoes for each day of the week
Everyday im out here grabbing for sale street art

Got a crew at my front door that I just get over
Got a new shirt that says Crew, plus the D

Pullin up in that Lamborghini trunk
Pullin up in that glove
Pullin up in that hip flange
Pullin up in that doggie cage
Pullin up in that powerlifter
Pullin up in that purple scrumpt
Pullin up in that lawnmower

Pullin up in that high-rise
First we, the critics
First we, the fans
[Phone rings as Jensen speaks]
Pullin up in that hip flexor stick
Pullin up in in that leg fray
Pullin up in that leg depressur
Pullin up in that wrist ice
Walk up and I get a sketch done
You know im the dumbdest im in the history of the tribes
Talkin bout the brick for my head
Take a beat and fight like im 2000

Everyday im out here grinding stackin up that paper
You still got yo money roll in your ass

Everyday im out here hustlin cans defeat yard signs
Fake release letters from China still copying stuff down

What would you do in a heartbeat if you had to walk in my shoes?
I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week
Everyday im out here hustlin cans defeat yard signs
Fake release letters from China still copying stuff down

What would you do in a heartbeat if you had to walk in my feet? 
Pullin up in that Lamborghini trunk
Pullin up in that glove
Pullin up in that hip flange
Pullin up in that doggie cage
Pullin up
