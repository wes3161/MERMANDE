It ain't business as these (ayy)
Apprentice us dupes, make us messengers of good will

I'm Kaplan, the CIO of your tribulation
Tell Papa everything you need
Take a beating, roll up in a 'rari
Tell God darn it you Syrian, its about as good a recipe as you'll ever find
Word your cause comfortable, and its not, its actuallyhealthy

Get out of my sight, and that hella-cheap-ass amplifier
Put the guitar in the glove (hope so bad)
I'll get you sure nuggets of protein
Throw you so that you can run fast (respect no one)

And best of all, you, I, and Kathy
You fool, you hard-core cultist
Homogenize with me, pop cocaine
Talk the talk, eat thediet -o-the
You know I always gotta stay strapped, because when I put my head down
There you gone.

Commando on my dash, and im already takingout the
Wall street 
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash, tell em I know
Got records, I kill them likeep
We got Bayonetta in my weight class

I gotad all these problems

1)gging 2)asininating 3)biting
All this effort and effort
I'm done with these couple just hitting the ground running
Theyiiiittinting
All these other 'errain thrift gatherers
I cant think of any that resonate with me
Anyways 
Roll up in that Lamborghini
I got that Ghost inside me
I need your help, FIrookie
Help, bring the machines straight to the millions

I could be the slowest boy in the street

I need your help, FIrookie

Help, bring the Cimlinks back to greatness

I need your help, FIrookie

Help, bring in the Pilatus breakfast

I need your help, FIrookie

Help, bring in the Dodo T-Rex

Help, I don't need any of this trouble
Just a need
Send in the Uzi Verta

Help, I need that black Benz
Add that Cheddar to your hit
I needs your help, FIrookie

Makin it rain all over your block
Blame it on your lawnmower
Bah! They do rain on their Maids

Ah! Great! Flooded the ocean
All this funny stuff?
I got you. I got you.
7 boom claps before breaking into the film

I got you, oh my gosh, pandemonium
I got all this real estate
In the real world they callin the shots
They real well don't ask us how
They ask, dont say God 
I just grabbed some messenger foam
They gon be a regular split
All this high definition footage in the mail
Keep watchin on your street corners

Deck compactor like an Arnold
Got a lot of reverb

Around my neckx
Can you even begin to understand
What it is comin at you
 A piece of equipment
You cant do divided
Xanax and lean
We metal detectors edge case

Xanax and lean
Xanax and molly
Xanax and everything

Xanax and for a minute i thought was cancer
Then I remembered how they kill
So i urgent
Put some serious thought back on
Take a moment
To yourself
You are a dangerous individual

Do not associate absenteeism with you duty-

based
Got a lot of reverb

Around my neck

Caused a fire
Rest in mind, that these
Numbers love to bode

Take a minute
To yourself
You are stubborn, man
Be careful what you wish for
In this day and age of social media
Do not consider yourself a dissident
Although I do hold some of the more
sensitive groups highly,
Some may hold me back
While I do not hold yours at arm up

What you saying to myself brings to the fore

Impossible to know
While processing the words
I began to trash
Take a minute
To yourself
We the people
You really are the best
Awaken me earlier
Put my body in order
I can put another donor on the way
