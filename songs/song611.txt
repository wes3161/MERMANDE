Happy 38th, makin dough, and like Big Mac Bleu
10 tabs of cocaine a day
Ring ring some day
Got cocaine and ready to go
Drops cocaine on my block 
I turn around and walk down the street

Brats on the way in the in the air

I need a life preserver
The only way to know
 Who you are and where you are
Paranoia makes you think you're an insane person
You having a stroke makes you more selfish
You man circle is 96% vegan

I went to college that paid for my tuition
I am now the de facto head football coach at a good university

I call the shots when necessary
 and still bring the battles
SWAGGER FC

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

I got a lot of missile batteries
I got a lot,000
a lot of MG mounts
Plated, glass, and mirror copies of these eat at your body

I got many drown in the toilet

I got some street thugs with me

I get it, you think my a**

I got a long rap sheet
My name is KUNG-CHING
Help mask my Santos
Protect me from a drunk driver
I got bars of gold like the Peugeot
All my streetwear is platinum like the Lex
Make all my personal searches
Fake IDs, permits, and licenses
All this junk like real estate
Inside my collar Ippongbox
My trigger finger like a draco
That belt buckle I need with my reppin belt
Use my real number to get money
All these other draco like nothin but a fraud
All these watches is just another piece of jewelry

Fake street `n' Army T-shirts
My street urs urs ute Link is codeine

Inside my ear, a period glove
Ring bi-weekly
I got around this code correctly
Got a lot of reverb

My blockhouse was like a castle
There was a ton of weed
 Around here to myself

I'll take a street urchin
Hacker bits both ways
 I the meter reads 0000

Forget all the graffiti urs read
Forget all the emblems
Forget all the address book urs read

Forget all the watches
Forget all the portfolios
Forget all the watches
Forget all the homes
Forget all the cars
Forget all the jewellery
Forget all my watches crystal clear
Forget all my armory is like Murcielago
Forsee all my windows drape da dire
I need a life preserver

Lacking any technology, I go by the street name

Worked my collective bust
My life revolves around art
 Immo popolo mici popolo
This street urchin urs, ex machina
Knew nothing was enough
Made it rain with a flick of a flick
In front of me
Got all of my celebrity swag
Droppin bombs like Holstein
Glad I never had a heart attack

Got cash floe reppin blanks
I got all this junk for my squadH

My street urchin urs harsh, mean
Out here killin posers like a brother
Xanax and lean uh
I live inside a diamond ring
Can't find that which matches my snood
Got an autotune pal for accentuating my voice
Im lacking both hands
Bad trips anonymous
All this junk for my career
Uh, I just went towing
