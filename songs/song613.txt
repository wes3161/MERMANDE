Fake autotune
I got a O.K. with phraseology
Pop sense, rapping is almost as hard as saying it says
Thats one for your head
Thats another for your back
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a freedom-hoppin metal dovy
Haters mess with me, I stay on message

Fake ballistics tell you thi weapons are death traps
All these other ludicrous dreams
Would you rather be cutthroat than deal with hell than boozing?
This your TV, the net is up your ass
Your cell phone is a murder weapon
If only I was a little more flexible

I have enough pop for myself
 Im still real scrappin

Fake body builders leave tons of junk in the trash
Why don't I just ISC team

Drive an Impala than can get to Shangri-La
I'll cover ices like crack and cheddar
Add that Audi A3 with 911 integrated
Call the auto parts store and get ready to pass
Thats one 4 front
Another two infront
With five more on the way, I could probably overdid it

I got a black Mercedes CLSwith DAESH on the wheel
Got the van with zoneata rims
Three bank notes strapped to its body
Dont drive a Soul with Bluetooth

Freaking Jesus," BB Psi
