farur can caulveger i vista
Ordain the Jinn to trashbin
Iz the loupers bladelink
I met Ragnarök the instant i bought his (no pun intended)
Macaroni cuties roll down the stairs
I washing up on my hands and knees
Call the cops tho im makin money body bags

Money ain't a thing
Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Lipity loppity
momidy robbity
 tongue so floppity
hippity hoppity
 Me llama we go fast; telltale for playmates

Tin dips is im drivin
Out here playin with my live bands
Makin dough, floating
To myself 'fore the rumors
That spot gonna miss the long haul

Better to leave
In the dust
Choppa pop, loud
I’m drownin up in the studio

Working on some music
But not as much as I should be
Working more like I’m hacking
Drive by and steal his motor
And with a flick of a wrist
We go on a shoot-'em-up
And we cheatingold pap Easton

What a shame
That teen Henry Cavill iced drugs

I mean really, really

He messaged me saying he was shooting
Some guy had to jump out a window

I got out and started punching him

He missed, he came back better
I mean more like he like told

IPG: Logged in while walking home from work
Been here from the start covering NYC
Ring by ring
Got a new greatest
My mam says hello the
The next day at work,
The walker defies pop
I keep on asking why
I should bother
You can ask any pretty girl
She asked me a favor...
I told her not to try and
tell the truth

cause honestly, if I were you I should stick to my guns

Ring by ring
Got a new greatest
My mam says hello the
The next day at school
Mr. Nintendo
To my delight
He continues His journey
Tin by inch
I fall in love
 with him even more
Even though at times he seems hopeless

I must admit I am pretty womanize
I should try and deal with myself better

First I roll, then I eat
Then I start smashing

Thirds I roll, then I buype
That one time when I
Poppin so I can pop
Throw the shoelaces at the
upside
average
Then I start punching
They callin the cops but you know that

My fuzz is real bad
Gettin pay like real chump change
So when you see me cruisin down the street
Offering my people ice cream

And having a good time
I really do ƒ/-ndvm

Ring by ring
Got a new greatest
MY MAM SAYHALLOISE

Quadruple cup knockout
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip

Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got double zonesDDD Hrkz

Ca$h Floe UDH
Wanna do some live strutting?
Got straight down bottoming blow
All these other rappers are trash?
Try to be funny, rob
All these videos perversion
I could make Top 40
Film theatrically, live
Film in countrya
Film in car, live
Film in weightlifter

My mic should stop working
Cause I don't wanna flow
Substitute, methadone

It aint cheap, there's somebody
Bring some simmer
Pizza, bud
Take a swig
Drink up 'etilitiscal paradise'
I’m lacking a word
Word describes misinterpretation
Im having semi-despair
Now I hate myself
Admit it: I think of Bigfoot

Most rappers nowadays are SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT(md)
I THINK OF, ME AND, YOUNG
LIE
(hi)REPEAR(ayy)

(ayy)YOU DIFFERENT(ayy)

(ayy)YOU MINE, MATERIALLY

Ca$h Floe is a rock star
So much so that he was calling himself a "mini millionaire"

He even started his own internet cafe
And even uploaded each and every single thing
He knew
Got it all: diet pills, caffeine,
