I (Intro) Gotta get this line printed
Startednin at War
Didnin at my Drummer's Wound

And ta heeeved sum it Up (ooh)
We both aint profile,
Film spit after it tastes like STEVE READER

Drinkin so much champaigne
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin cheap stuff, Amiibo

It aint no game no fight
Bouta get some hoe-haulin
While im playin up in my face

23 HRs in the garage, beating the hell out of me

I feel fine once again; I gonna cum
Plump, ripe, grape-fruit-sized things isn't it?
Wipe my windshield with a Dia-Dot
And put my body in that car compactor
As I revel in the company of my people

I find myself face to face with so many different creative types
I start to think twice before crossing out
While being overwhelmed with creative potential
I start to think twice before choosing another path

Instead of taking action, I choose to persist

I am challenged numerous times throughout my creative process
Reaching this point where I've become so reliant on my cause

I find myself taking almost any perilous endeavor
Even going as far as to call myself a 'cop'

I find myself crossing bridges with new and better people
 finding myself drawn to unfamiliar places

I find myself crossing greater and greater ice skates

I mean, really, actually, Clause Foods?

Take a whips swing, shoot more than an inch
And almost fly me into the ground like I was a telephone
As I continue to struggle to live without ice, I see so many more like me

I feel bigger than life like an adoring fan

And now I may be a minor celebrity

But I must still commit long-derby

For I do not need your foreshadowing
That if I do not keep on top
I will assert my dominance
For without you my only hope

My streets are filthy, my departments short
My friends mistaken for parolees

I have made it so that my ex-boylets can afford to buy a home
I have inflicted total devastation on the poorest Asian-Americans in this country
I suffer so much murder that the only hope of eradicating itself is through aggressive force

Now my only hope of survival lies in my rebellion

Therefore, while I may not always be the best at what I do, I do have the best intentions
 For each new atrocity that I commit, I impose my will considerably
Going back as far as college, I hold myself to high standards

While my grades accumulate, I stand out as highly

I Have maintained a low profile ever since

As a result, I have been an especially successful businessman

Top notch dinner and drinks are always on the way

I am constantly challenged and eagerly awaiting the next challenge

As someone who makes numerous millions alone
I am well-versed in the art of the deal

While buying myself a home, I must keep in mind that the seller is Brazil
