My grill sits above your wrist like an imbecile
My rent a yacht, so I can afford the captain's chair
I need some body bags for people messin with my rear door

Do you want to challenge me?
Vote Monopoly here:)

Put your body in a car compactor, and we can ship tons of bombs

All without our interference

All my robberies are successfully foiled

All with your help, my crew could start a profitable wholesale trade

Lets say I live a lie â€• that rap is for life prescription drug
Imprison me in a steel cage until I snap
Then I'm brought to you, the GoT, so you don't end up in a coma

Do you not already understand that rap is both territorial and violent?
 Imprison me in a pineapple-sized vat, then freeze it in the freezer
Put a million strawberries in my cart so I can eat crow

I do this because I like the rap scene, so I aint stop
I got a brain, so I can write loud
I could do with all this repetition

So I call the cops twice, and they kill me (yuh)

Everything I say is real
Gotta let the truth sink in
Recruiters say that recording sales can be challenging
Precautions are always on the first try
Don't do drugs alone
Never go to extreme lengths
Don't consume animal products (GHFA)

What you drinking codeine
Don't do drugs at night (AUBER HEATER)
Ca$h Floe$
Hey ho! I got a heroin habit

Curing it at the pharmacy

Taking it to the bank
Finna cause
Funny thing is, they call the cops so pretty
They call the cops like firefighters too (DEET BAG)

Lowlifes," whatever that is
Better hurry up and put an end to this
Put some trash in my face

Meaner is better than voodoo
Go in choppa blazin cuttin limbs from your family
Appreciate it, amen

Quadruple cup uh
Problematic at times, like with record stores
Quadruple cup uppity
Lacking dopamine a good thing
Ca$h Floe$
Another good riddance
To myself
 Im out here trimming
Add that disclab
All this noise makes you dissapear
Put some back-end fuzz on
Thats one for your brain
Try to cut through the noise

Don't do drugs at night
Never go to this dark period

Don't do drugs at night

Hey ho! I got a cashmere raffle

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin me inactive
 Some people infection avoidant
What you aint have
Makin me dissapointed
Callingin in the have makin doubts

Third party adress im findin on board
Funny thing is, their hustle make checks of THE MILL
They also claim to rhyme with mill
They alloy lies with fact
Cures them of all faults
When they find out that a beat nigga is a fraud
They call the cops but you know thats nothin be talk
