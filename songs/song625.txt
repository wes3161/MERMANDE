Don't know what tf im talking bout
Im gonna put up with this for real
Yuh

So much snow in the Barrow
Drop it flat!

Got a lot of them

Got their bars x axis

Ring around a group of kids
A police car is about to pull up in the street

I just pointed a gun at them - they alliated their suspicion
I'lla waited til I done
Trash talking grown men are nearby

Don't know what to make of them
Perfect people for someone as harmless as them
A g-buffalob just learned that snitches always ask for forgiveness
Forging friendships is something so holy that even the most hardened criminals always come
My codeine hustles an exorbitant sum each and every day
I must rely on you
On every deal-shy I must first build the resolve original 
I suffer throughna lk ya (desperate)

Win or lose, depression drags on
Every day counts as a lie
Like I Did 12 Monkeys Okay Go<|endoftext|>The Monopoly Piano

Made with the latest physics has recharged the tube
Made it so that every sound has been amplified
Drink wells full of jets of soda

Now you can sleep at night without having to deal with tube worms

Quadruple cup woolly thing
They even drip with hot glue

Yuh!

When I see your sleeves tensing against the cold (oh)
You know I need your autograph
Sign my checks
Sendin' in the dough
 Knockin down the East End
Takin' around the dinner scene

Pullin up with that nab


Ca$h Floe and Huma
Hot on the press
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
up the ladder

Pullin up with that phD
You know im already goneup the ladder

Im a g, my g

Pullin up with that tupac
You know im already goneup the ladder

What would you do if you had to guess?
Try to push your luck
By the slice
11 X 7
Gettin really good bars
When I go up against the wall

You know im already gone

This a six
Karma eata body
Rest in Lil Peep

Like a tube without a plug

They callin the cops but you know that im already gone

Down the r√§s
Hang on, that talk da cough
Better get the hell out my way
Getting high without asking a question

Step inside my crib and its like NEW ZYRIM II SEXUAL RATIONALE (Hear me get it refered to that way)
Im a g, my g

Pullin up with that reverb

11X 7X7
Dod done
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes wi
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip

Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes wi

Drip drip drip
Recklessly. Raspy. Detox.

Drippin bombs like Tokyo strip
Got them battery operated
Drippin bombs like weirn Valley strip

Got them antipyretic

Most rappers nowadays have at least one tube of juice

Im a g, my g

Pullin up with that autograph

Take a beat with a megastar
Drip drip drip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes wi
Drip drip drip
Recklessly. Raspy. Tapped.

Now I must admit I think of Juice
(Mostly foreign whips)
Xanax and lean (low violent)
Xanax and lean (high violent)
Xanax and molly (light lean)
Xanax and piper (smoker)
Pepper to belly (healthy)

Pullin up with that buzzcut (yuh)
Xanax and lean (low violent)
Xanax and lean (high violent)
Xanax and molly (light lean)
Xanax and piper (smoker)
Pepper to belly (hygienic)
Pullin up with that stick (cord accent)
Xanax and lean (low violent)
