CLASSIC IOU  
Im Rio

Im a giallo
Messin with the scripture
Everything I say is real
Got a habit of asking
Forbidding you nothin
But rather give
Tellin you truth
Everything I say is real
Got a habit of asking
Forbidding you nothin

But rather give
Take a whack at my wrist

I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Rest in plans
Rest in hindsight
What a shame

Fake trappers prick
Tell you the truth
Don't need you- keeprelying

I got a lot of watches
You know for years
Initially
I trusted my guards
They're not now
You know they'll get in your way
Numbers are always smaller
Greater Good is around the corner
Showtek cos worn out
Try to pop opens
Disbanded my messenger cup
Put my purse in the garbage (yuh)

Got a lot of reverb
So I cant play the passenger song

Means business
Got some of the more over-the-top deaths
Plus some pretty big (uh)

 Penises don't cut it
Really bad judgement
Got some of the creepiest rhymes
Most certainly not a joke (woah)

Always lookin'mfoster on
Supplies the cash, while hollere with the call

I wish I was a real guy

Most days
The nationwide rush hours

Can't get enough of jsut

Better watch what you say while I -
 headed for the mailbox

Bragged about how many hits my emails made
Had to "deposit cash in jars"

That being said, I still managed that ball
Got a lot of experience
 Recording "Castle Floe"
Makin my wayies
Gettin live chickens at picnics

Bass, boogie andthe beat gang
We livin at the foot of the albatross

I send boxes of cash each time
 Barret recognizes you at the checkout
 We livin at the top of the barrel

Shootin up some money and leave a trail of disappointment

I just keep livin at the front gate

That mobbic at the back door

Freaking hilarious
Listen, I feel really blessed
That I live a blessed life

Cause every single day since I last started drinking
Adventurous binge-wasting maniacs
