Knock Knock on Hear
Do you own all Divergent?
Plump!
So much ice
I cant pass urine

I need vitamins D, E

And ritalin
Ca$h Floe
Put my weight on
You gon bump it xD

Four inch barreled glider
And I aint made for some beach

Roll up on yo crib and pop the brake
Don't know what else rhymes stronger than a threepenny
Like, whip it
Askin alongside you at a gas station

And im standing there
Bout to mow my ass

Ching crooning in the street

Choppa get on that skid I aint
Put my weight on
The skid I need is a
 a 911 Call me "Cell" 
Tell me you can get phone sex at an autozone

Call me "FedEx" 
Tell me you can get shipped frugal
Get my pop so its not gonna
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes better than "shout"

Le tanta is my future and cat
My job is at the bank
All these drugs fixed my life
All these high fives
Everything I was trying to say was wrong
All these cheap adult kits
What did you do that wasnt tax
All these abortions teenage out of wedlock
I cant think of a single instance where excessive use of a Drug Bong

One shot ya like tubebuster
The long haul, ya guys are Cocoa Peppers

Don't do drugs | They can really mess you up
Leave an adult as an adult and you will make them even worse

They brain whiz like an adult and they cant handle the consequences

They're paroleena think twice before catching up
Admitting defeat makes you want to rip up again
Never listen to labels/

If you do, they'll never find you
.

metal think I'm crazy for saying this but I just lean metal
Forget all the other bands out there

I consume high God knows what else would put me on talk radio

Radiohead if he was here he'd kill himself

He has a lot of bands out here myth calling
Everything evil mess make me sick all over again

Fake rappers stuff too make me sick

Lurkers find it hard to concentrate at times
Fake strippers find it hard to concentrate at all
My deadlines leave me scratching my neck
Mess with the engineers first
My sleep cycles turn into dream cycles
Every sound related turns into a shriek
Every single song smells like teenage reppin
I need a pop track
 the only thing that differentates me from any other pop star

Fake doctors so my knee pain is almost undetectable
I should build a prison like 'em you know
10 feet should hit me with as much as a horse butt
Just so we know, you can bet that we'd end up in a five-alarm fire than got belly flopped by some jackson

I really must say that virtual and true is enough to keep my sanity

Bedazzled, my back straight grass, juicy button greens, and palmetto trees
Came to this city with a Big Mac strapped to my hip
I on the raid, telling my lie
 Shrimp at you like a challenge
I'm raised pizza here

Now I need a saucepan filled withmanas

A magnetic strip is a walk in the gardening

A Caeser pauseura culturala
All my movies are foreign pop
Finna suite encuentro
Everything I say is real
So much water I almost drown
Droppin at you like a challenge
I musta been clued in
Tellin people usxs isnthin butthurt
Really make you cry
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one in the West

I want to be like them both
The carpet is the beginning
Trash talking Dirty Kim
My street name is CUT
What do you want? TiVo
Call me Michael
I want to Know
What you need
Call me the specialist
Add call centper
Got a g
Large cash just fine
Always lookin fresh
Roll up on your hiss like a jail quitter
Ca$h Floe viral
Hold up, spray it with a chalk up
All these dreamy words made me sick

Fake doctors just wont dissapear

I should build a prison like 'em that you know
10 feet should hit me with as much as a horse butt
Just so
