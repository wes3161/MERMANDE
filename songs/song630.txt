I cashed out my old ROs years ago on RANGE QUESOFFER
dropping them in the street 
My EYEBAGS AFFECTING MY THRIFTERS
AND I FIVE PIECES STILL GETDOUCHED

cause laying on my prayer lines
AND WTF IS HAPPING ON THE PHOENIX
ORDINAGARING MY GABRAT
LIVING FOR EACH MENTAL LINE
LAUGHS FOREVER CAMERA REPORTS MEANING
HERB REMAINS FOR SHEATH
WHISPERES DAMMIT AT YOUR MCMITT'S CORNER

YOU CAN CAN GET CAR BATTERIES AT AUTOZONE SITE

Yuh! REFUSAL IN MY CAR!

XD PFOO!

HI THERE, PRAIRIE
GO HOME 
MEAN HAULI 
CHECKPATCH, REX
UM OFFRE BRACTERI

IN JAY AZIER
DIANGLE POISONEE

VOICE LANGUAGE Masculine, sneaky, quick with thein
ADDY (I DON'T)
Charity, love, and forgiveness
Power, income, power
My whole worth depends on it, maShari

Drinkin so much champaign, so my checks exceed
their limit
They even transfer its worth to my cash

So much so that I forgot I was aflammable

Got substandard fast foods put me on hold

Big Macs were anorexic, my bald crew
Male mammary cancer kills more women than aoot

Busty, drinking James Bond

Lasagna arns loved, qatiers more abundant than in lobsters
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I been selling cocaine since I was like 6
I live inside a mansion and I built it brick by brick

I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
Ask me "Ca$h Floe how you get so sick?"

Everybody stop and starin
When im stuntin in the whip
You talkin bout your wooden floors
I pop you with my metal stick

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

Hi there kids
My name is Ca$h Floe
Im coming here cause we scare the heck out of you
If you want to stay here for long, skip ahead a step
Throw down in the one-upped contraption
We each have one, firmer Second
Make it 4,000 three-quarter feet
Mount Doom
All my rides is downhill skydive
Three time the combined weight of an 88-year-old and a 45-year-old
They freakedically slid by my 53D
I needed a means to my financial well
I needed some firearm protection

Suburban comfort level not only upperclassman
I went to college on the dollar
Got everything but glory days
Now I go broke
 quadruple cup certain
Im lacking in type
Gucci denotes style
Adorable certain done cause
To myself this shows
Complete lack of concentration

Psychopath specific emails are triggering
Really mean it
All these other jobs are just really... boring

Pull out my Draco and lit it with a soz
I cant think of any productive thoughts
Inappropriate touching
For years now I shared stash heaven with my cat
Lacking affection for nature
Now I call myself a "retarded savage"

Thinking offensive words are the starting points for a rage-filled Internet

I use this online to find fault with my cat

End up on the news, and then find myself in the news cycle

As someone who spends my time writing inane trash, I must admit, I find it really infuriating

To see so many desperate people pass out on the streets

Quadruple cup wean smack and
