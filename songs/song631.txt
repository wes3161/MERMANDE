Apparently she should sell cigarettes
Cause Versace ain't cheap
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between your eyes
Finna boutta gonna having a drive-by
Tap the trigger twice and you die BANG

Versace don't do platinum stally
Sydney singers peeps platinum
They even sell toilet patches

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Yeah, I told ya so.

When you find out that we're real killas, and that we aint playin
You better barricade your windows before I start spraying

I hope so, because then I might start her up in a gash

Yuh yuh

Startroumnin and disorderly people a-force
Waited so long thought it was a homerun
Made a fool of myself wiping up TV
And that euphonium give back all my youth

So many heart attacks I should transplant
Im out here private speaking my opinions

Fake doctors are only really going to save my life

Startruinously rave about whips, sub dos
What a straightforward day!!

Lacking any purpose in my life, I need these whips
Startroumnin and disorderly people a-force

Waited so long thought it was a homerun

Made a fool of myself wiping up TV
And that euphonium give back all my youth

HI LUIS
I need some organic help
Send in the pro bono lawyer

You ain't gon live to see 40, yo
Appreciate them a million times
Life is too short
Like to think I'm worth a thousand words

Send in the pro bono lawyer
All these rappers I only own
Im just labels til I get to their heads

They expect everything they ask for
They interpretations of true Gospel
Everything I've heard so far is true
All these pro wrestling references
They really are the professionals
I should buy a home
Covered in shadow
Descending kindred spirits
Lacking any righteousness
Im tainted with every single sin
Was raised Mormon since I was four
Was raised white until I was like 28
Don't know a thing about God that ain't tainted

Tell that to the homeless people I know
Covered in white trash
Impaired in a bank robbery
Ill put myself in more trouble
Than any other Christian, God only knows

Haters ldlltodies word wanes
Backed on the street, bro
What a shame
That nevermind
Got cash floe pretty much
Got cash floe gonna four
Got cash floe everybody go whip 'em

Got cash floe I need more Target ice skates

Money ain't a thing
Talkin bout the people in the street
All these auto parts
All these auto parts (isi)
What a shame

That nevermind
