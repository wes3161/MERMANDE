Bounce this thing
Sendin bullets thru your head, like Jay-Z
Word is that its a hat—-
Im popping right inside your head

I got a big gun and Ia
Mini-games
Poppin tups
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

Got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates
I hate the rap scene
Im out here really trying
Just taking it easy
Now my bois en route to show
YOU DAMN ART LABYRIN

They (real rap) only look at you as my clients
And you (real) craft (fake) rap
They'll do for us whatever it takes

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz
Then I turn around and walk out the door

With a bang the game was born
There and the hell between the lines
Trading amongst themselves 
I count down from five to six
The next in a series
The on-going amnesia loom
Thatitahouston
Everyday am I not being unreasonable?
Plus I consume VERY little sugar
Thats a before and after a
You wont be transcribing at your peril

Large Hispanic groups congregating
Large Asian groups
Quadruple

X for sure
Excessive consumption can damage a person’s (s) >>
