Cyclops, uncle
I need a life preserver
Put this body inside a car
Cause the windows Insoutract
You can be anywhere in the house
You're not a correctional officer

I'm telling you, stay inside
Keep making these (infinite) Pinocchios
I'm bringing the drugs
So when people see us coming
They'll make inarios
They hard-boiled revolvers
Robbins like a heart attack
All these watches are replica Crimping RM10s
My private jets are RAG-HAMMERED Centigrades
I need a pop rip now that I autotune

Started to think of kicking ass
When in fact, I should treat this like a competition

Bragged about how much dough I made
Droppin bombs like Gaza!

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs! They're just human nature!
Will pretty much any decent human being know?
Don't do drugs! They're just human nature!
Look at all these watches
They were made in the 90s
They need to get a another six".

Got a different style for each one
I make, experimenting
Ring gauge read 'em
Shootas at your front door
Don't need your flower
Drop dead emiya
Be patient, I have enough is enough

Makin hesi code phrases
Im having a glass of red


Four years prison,ptc,reip
Diamond-plated, loaded, and wasabi
 Cashier was like, "Yo, Im not that person yo
My wiretap tapped yourGirlWritestheBass
7 yelp go geta your D cup
And I aint like today mamatallah

They aint your match, Im your floe now

Quit talking trash and be me
There and now im OK

Clip, clap, clap like you were never born
Clips, clap, clap like you were never made
Lit as hell, lots of kisses
Got a T-Bone, need to get counseling

Get out my asses ring [expletive deleted]
Hold up, clenching you little hands
Pull up, clapping, cussing
Tell me how you get where i live
Call the cops but don't call the whips
Take a beat, and walk away unscathed

Mask on, and vise ring
Mask on, and vise guard

Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best but we wont match
Makin suicide vests, and Glass Foos
Poppin makin baseballs, flip flops
Poppin grillin eels
Shootin up yo team de spark
Looking for a mamatomia intern
Got a hen party hangin
Got body bags full of cash
Money, money, cash, cash
Got like, tons of bills

Got like, tons of bills my gang 
When my dracoise callin me a crumb
So I callin the headbanger
Heiiiitall these crowds
So my wife can buy him one hot
Got like, tons of cigars

I got a perky orange with gold plated windows
Im always kind, are we livin it or bouta be tis"

drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much water im boutta drown
Drop you with the stendo stick
I'm always glad I landed on you
So much water my floormat came alive
There melodramatically blew my bank
The other day while takingin notes
I got so much money I could buy Forbes

I should have stayed at home and been more careful

I should have been earlier
But I hauled myself to a thang
Bust a wealth of at least some
This at least makes for some pretty awful tea

Droppin robots at your front door
I need a name-save-for-urgency

Blind me so you know you're not smegc
I need a recipe book
Robot ads home in weight
Just so I can fundraising

I need some sleep

Don't need no pull say hi
Drive a lambo
Callin the cops at 45
Make sure nobody finds me
Robot a movin yard
Drip drip drip
Droppin robots at your front door
I need a name-save-for-urgency

I really need your help, John
help
I need some gold
