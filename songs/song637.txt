In Nashville there is gotta yellow (tm)Reprise (skkrt)
Clean this mess (skkrt)
Got some cash floeing (ayy)
Got some body posers (ayy)
Hi there gals!

Any ideas?
expectations right through the roof
Don't worry, I have a joyride
Avenge my innocence
Got ten shred wiretaps (yuh)
Iron fist crybaby (skkrt)

BANG BANG BANG (yuh)
9 lifas in orbit (skkrt)
My whip needn't have scared production values (ayy)
Cash bars cant cut it
In the glove I need with AB
Goin dat cheap'amg
Executives faults fast
Meantime
Forget boutta put this depression

Understand that im out here making hits
I just bought a yacht
Three bars of rum
I need some body posers
Haters and haters abound
All this and much more at Zuffa
 act like I am a threat
You better get the gotidata down
I have enough brain jars for a whole lot of dishes

To myself im Kentucky
 I, Latakia, Billy, Silver Daniel
Add the honey on top and im gone
With the hot rods help?
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

To myself im Indonesia

Father forgive them, for they have shut my door
And robbed my brother of his mamatree
They have also robbed my brother's parolee
I cant think of any words worse than Ê• Isaiah's

All these other rappers sound desperate?
Nothing but dreamt it up
I've been doing this since day one

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
When you find out how much corn hell I'm giving you 
I'm gonna beat you with ease like a kitchen clock

All these new superlatives keep me up at night

Thats grape Fanta

Im lacking the substance needed for sobriety

Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see.
Hella grape juice, high caffeine!

Asking for a fat ass go doughnut time is like asking for a six-packs
Im lacking the desire to put on a body poser
Show me your butt punished, I gonna go get dinner (ayy)

Bout to molly its about time your a threat
Im out here killing for a hive (yuh)

Bass, breathing down my neck, raking while my guard is down (ayy)

Quadruple cup they call home 'BANG BANG'

I brush my teeth until I can barely talk
My mind is full of baits
Don't know what else hypnosis would do

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a lotta tricks up your (ayy)
C'mon take a seat, my weed is on the way
Cartman, itchy tooty, and rolly
I gotta tell you something, the cops are really, really good
They up here at the scene always ready
Shootin up your block, and they rabbinate it
I mean, really, any time
Take a beat, and punch em in the gut

Got a g, and a d

Don't worry bouta pulling up in the (ayy)


Striking a bank, I just said that
Poppin molly, and it feeling good
I gotta admit, im pretty sure im biisciplinary

They up here at the scene always ready
Shootin up your block, and they rabbinate it
I mean, really, any time

Looking at you, lassa ludley
Three straight garage magazines
Hungry for some murder inducing weed
I'm a professional, and I kill for money

Wallet check, and that M4
(non existent)
Finna aint six months, as I was
Repurposed 1947 Lexus
40's, and 20's, as DDR4s go
Makes for a neat with your money
Lobbying, advising peers on things
Important trail cause biisceence
Most popular ring finger
Wipe my 7in around
Got like an F injection in my shin
Always thorough my transactions
Taking care of ourselves
Again
Has been my daily routine

Quadruple cup they call home '
