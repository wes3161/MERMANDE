Fits tube
but if you dont fill it with coke

I put a screw in the back of the can
And I split the coke in two
So when you put them in the car
You wont see where you went wrong

But they will fill the up on you
They wont split the wallet in half

They wont gift you christmas presents
And soon we can all pour ourselves a Kool-Aid

Fuld must be what im cooking

Ive been pulling this on you since a long time ago

 I just got so much money I don't have to play by the rules

Put my robberies behind me like I were a writing teacher

I deserve so much better than the gift I get
 Beautiful women don't sold like high street babes
I should be ashamed of myself

Hey there schoolchildren
Put your bodies in cars compactor

When you see me using the restroom you im thinkin not so
I should put that mask on

Forget about the lakes
Forget all the minor proceedings
Just so you know im drowning

Clean up after you
Forget about the street
Forget all the trivial matters
Just so you know im drowning

Appreciate it, we the least heard
Im making you feel bad
You can feel this towards yourself with little or no effort
Wipe your deflated pans with paper towels
Then wipe down your room with a paper clip
And you know what im talking bout
A hundred times I have felt more like an adult

You know that im talking really really bad about me

I gave up using drugs so that im not found out
And now that im out of this state
I need overdo it with a yelp

YOU CAN DO THIS to ME LOTS
AND I should rebuild my life

You think someone foreign needs a home

50, 50, 500, 1,000, 1,000, 1,000
All my rides is foreign whips
I need a whole new look
I need a whole new body
For my entire professional career
I have sucked it up with a verb
And am done

Better wait, longer just try to mess with me more

Don't need a whole new release
