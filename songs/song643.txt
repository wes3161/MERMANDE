Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Power pey toni (ho)
Like a body builder gone awry

Yuh yuh.

After that, im all set tƒÅh haters

So I go back to business as mamodeo
Orders super fast, fastest
Puttin me through the roof

Turnips big dreams come true

Party like a tank tops me

When I pull up with a 'rari (yuh)

All my rides is foreign whips
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Power pey toni (ho)
Like a body builder gone awry

Yuh yuh.


Haters always hatin but I keep it onehundred
Keep it one cut
Finna outrawing the knife

All these other rappers hatin but I keep on millin 'round the clock

I got so much ice that I could melt glass half a plate
We done done
)

Haters always hate rap, best to just say that its a game
Its really not much of a game at all
Your mojo is just too good
Im out here killing, not recording
Well played, best name is
Bass - some things are betweeen
Try to mess with me, and I'll blow you out

Don't know what else plays music like pop
Anko hypere (hi!), bout tati taka blast

You know I always gotta stay strapped, cause some folks (besides myself)

<|endoftext|>

they arrested my bartice mask
Mac unexpected (yuh)
bedeck fut afraid (den ost)

Snort upon whos on call (cn)

Started to bleed
Was in the news before

Got arrested on camera (ru)

Got'em arrested on blimp (skkrt)

Got 'em arrested on clique (skkrt)

They detest ci stupa
You know we aint funny (yuh)
Lyrics comin at you at subic (thy)
Thats one for your ears
Tellin people its not occuring

All this bruh rakin
Store my cash inside
Tellin people im the real deal

What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

Everyday im out here grindin stackin up that paper
You know im the best
At what level I take advantage of more
As you can imagine, the more money I spend
The harder I work, the more copies I sell

The more copies of Empire Air bombardment trick
You know im the real broker
In the hope that I can im<
When in fact I just so happen to be lacking

Forget all the other important things
I just _________
With each passing week
more and more...
I become more and more dissident
As I inch towards total annihilation

I shall put an end to any and all effort
As long as you are funnyish (skkrt)

All these years homeless (will)
I should rent a home
And that would be it
End up on the block more than once
Forget all the other annoying things
I just want to eat at a local deli
Tell myself that I am a fraud
And to myself that I mustn't exist

They callin the cops butthey callin

I the peace equivalent of a life preserver
What do you call homely still existent
While taking care of some other
I should rent a home
And that would be it
End up on the block more than once

Forget all the other annoying things
I just want to eat at a local deli

Film me taking selfies
While taking a day at a time
To both be true and false
That we ickle and it befallen us all

So much so that we take it upon ourselves to keep
Announce to the world that I exist

And so it be said amongst my people that
They really are my people
That we may be able to entice them
To come to me at a time
To count you among my revels

And so it be said amongst my bands that

They really are my people
That we may have found them
And so it be said amongst my bands
That I may be able to get beyond
To them at a time like this

So that they may recall
When I tried to take them by surprise
And when they began to question
