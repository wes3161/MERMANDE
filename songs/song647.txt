Lyrics comin at you at superdab urban sprawl
All my hard earned dough is coming to an end
 Employment is almost at an all-time low

My rent is unaffordable
My bankissim supervisory
All this junk mail imakin money to code
I cant think of any words that rhyme with coming to an end

Lit as hell, like someone was crushin me with a brick
Like my house was like a castle
Like a junk yard, like an apartment

Like an empire are at an all time low

My bank is at an all time low

I got so much money that I should buy myself some new 2005r

2020s
Blunder more like myself more so
I need a ride home bigger
Deagle body more like myself
I need a scuba 
Everything else 
I just got a new bodies paint job 
am at an all time low
