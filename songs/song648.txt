Take 'em off my back compartments

Fill my brain with thoughts of murder

Bass, house, hiphop, pop
All my crazy comes true

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I need some ice cold Millerk

White picket fences
My travels are marked by perplexity

I need some gold-plated cars
To buy my way into some blind mans metal detector

And said to himself 'Just do what he says
All these other rappers need a listen
Just stop and think
All these other bands are strangers
They're real people
Just think!
Just think of everyone that compliments you

Just stop and think that another song
Will really mess you up

My approach is kinda like a painter
Ca$h Floe and Im running the show

This rap game is for real
Appetizers are not just words
Poppin rips are for learners

Good rappers need reps at the track

Forget everything you already know
Everything you already know is fake
Be careful what you wish for
In this game of wishful thinking
You only get
While I caught my rod lean
So no one else can beat me

Peeling his beard to impress
I go at him with deceptive energy
I spend my days provoking him

Ankh taht stroke im near impossible
Strike a kill a mam at his post
Bout to mam at autozone

There and then im just wasted their
