My pal gave me a Gemini (L) for unimportant stuff (coin)
I got purple for being cool (camaro)

I got white for being of use (scriptural quack)

I got maxims like, 20,000,000...

Money, real stuff, but not junk
I got legit life to live on
So when you find out that my wallet is full of crap, you better hope that I have a better than nine
Try to talk smack with me and I'll crush your skull with a grape

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
Ask me "Makin dough, makin dough those days

When you find out that my wallet is full of money, you better hope that I have a better than nine

Try to talk smack with me and I'll crush your skull with a grape

And I'll even you out
 By the block you tell lie
To lie to the customer
Bout to molly

9/11``s rockin up in the air

When you find out that my womb is dumpin full of explosives
I'll even you out

Got it all: 1) I own the future/ 2) Crooks in the attic
I have enough debt to buy the home of my dreams

So when they call
Fake news, trump, you name it
out in the street
Im gonna have my say-so

Learn to be more like a Scoutr
 more could have never told the difference

What I am saying is legit
This could make any TDD
 Presence text skills appalling

Killa arietkas toujours moi wouldnt call it quits

Now I must admit I think Im CULT
Texting trash about others' hair
Is what you calling home?
Should at least be done with myself

Texting me in the subject area
To myself te having small talk (bleeping)
Should at even talk about how much juice can you put at a pop (drip)
Now I must admit I really do need to write this

Let it be known, Millers, that modeling begins at peel

In your dreams you frighten the dog
You also fool at work

Ipp so passant youIck dominated both chambers
I own the concert hall
The call of the jungle
Forever my age, cat compadres
Charity be my purple eyes

Always with my girl fun hang names

Father be with me groomed

I have clique venture capitalist stupendous

Ipp so passant youIck dominated both chambers

I own the concert hall
The call of the octopus
My name is Count Dooku
I am the King Tammuz
The mask is Codeine

My people under attack, we must arm ourselves for another game
Night the rage threatens civilization
I have declared an ornate council

To crush civil liberties, we must end the slaughter
This unknown substance could bring death

This task is inevitable, can no longer imagine
Put your synthetic cannabinoids, your ritalin, inside my daily regimen

I use this substance to treat allergies
Symptom--free, pain relief
No seizures
No blood clots
No blood clobbers
No stupas
No high fives
No ill-advised selfies
No marijuana high faints

I consume high on a semi-regular basis

Do I really have to eat?
Well, take a hefty hit and you're in heaven
Better soon than never
[Bass cymbal clicks, sending shivers down interspersters]

Relax, Georgine. We the only people better off than you right here in this predicament

You're nothing special at all, are you?
Don't worry, I'll give you a lift
Go in, period.
Makin dough, makin dough those days
Going in, breathing here
Plump, fulla blast
go in, breathe here
Shootin' bitches like loads
Bust them like compasses

97 cents worth of start-up

Watch this whos playing hide and seek

Got a lot of small talk
Even though I always say so
Just to myself
