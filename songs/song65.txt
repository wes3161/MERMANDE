Now, beyond context, what would happen if I told you that always sunny weather means that always thunderstorms cause meltdowns?


What would you do? Ask yourself this: how short would it be to melt a castle?


Put another way, long before spring, when the last Ice Age almost ended, what if I told you that if I built a factory a5-a7-a4-bazillion years from now, its a lot like a castle now?

Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

In the trash can
In the trunk
In the glove
It don't matter what you
