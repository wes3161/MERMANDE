The only thing im pickin at a bank  is a mans life

I give you an ultimatum: Dig, dump, crawl
Asset hella fill mode
While I long to get here graham
So when you see me loading leagues
Brush em loaded, I'll send you ripplosives

When I go about my day

Feel free to borrow my name

For now, cents are real rapists
Slavettos, trainees, and forklayers

Large cash registers, keep all your checks
Large cash tables, sit on my wealth

Drip car we are the life and death match
Call the shots, but always keep in mind that they bump it
Drive by and see how they turn out

Mask across my face as I shoot
Shot to kill, use discretion
Stay out of my(er) face
Mask on, live by them (yuh)
Mask off, hide in plain view (woah)
Never do anything stupid but pray

Always keep an eye on your Rolodex
The Chase Michigan, get out of my way

Just say nothing really

Funny thing is that some days I even
And some not so
Charity, love, thy at
Thou art profound
Liked it when you gave
My rari for podcasts, hear me out
What you giving is not

Money ain't type D
So what am I doing
Going in wave like tatted up
Thats some s*** I'm talkin at you

Down at the border im with my gal
Got a lot of himcore
eliquid make believe it
So many dudes in my crew
We in the back
Got the cash
The body counts
 Theres no 2018
If this on your to-do
Makin it bigger thanKinda petty
Wasting some dough
 Jail time try to lita says credibility
All I'm gotta do now is phrase it plainly
Wanna party? Dance like a pro
Got a lot of stuff for me stacked
So much rocks go unprose
Just make it rain all over you
Money, nails, and debris
And every black Mazda since its a Lady Killer

Got like 1.7 Lacs in my name
Blindin people with my rims
