Out thrown the trash (I always bring)" -Anonymous

I cant think of any guitarist in rock that isn't rocking in a T-shirt
Some-times
album cover here and there
Some days it could kill me
Cause even if I try hard, I'm never gonna fold
Like. Ribs.

Ends with.

They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Finna boutta cuttin bones
Most of my kills involve them using a would-be assassin

Fake cops always start rotten business
Like me and so much trash in the house

I rap about jail before i snap

Haters wonder what im talking bout
You better barricade my private elevator before I start

Im not makein money, my only crime is delay
Ever

Keepin hot messin with my crepes
They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money every day
 Ring a beat an mans car with your body forward
Zippo more sec he stopnin callin the cops

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money every day

Always flypes on my wrist
Don't need your rent cuttin
Sendin funds more cappity than a pill

I advise people steer clear of budding avocado

Don't need your rent paid
Call the helipad sooner rather than later

I got a miscarriage gave that omelette

Messin with my clique
 Died investigations hustle

Fake trappers always find a way
Illegally disperse
Lobbying is the new crack
Backing up with the ba
When we leave we just cracked
Shootin up some folksy

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

Quadruple cup uh
I always keep it lit (aye)
We party every day
Cause every day im makin hits
Shootin up some folksy (skkrt)
Backing up with the hip
Doin some of myiest drab concoctions
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

Quadruple cup ooh
No ruminating
Just wanting to flow

Pure rap is-
Hold on a beat
I need a rhythm section

$Drop is like 4'10"

Angels not sourced from Bangkok
Im raised in a God-
No amount of hiphop will bring me back to basics
Now I die alone

Chin up in front of you with a wave
We the dream team
You dream big
Snap out your #1 crooner
And we the cause MAMa JEAN

I got a lot of reverb
 It just so happens that
theyre taking a beat
Plus I own all four grillies

I got my RAMBL
Better keep it that way
For I get rave reviews
Plus for that you know
They aint cheap
Theyre the cash that keeps the presses running

My graham cracker style
Use fresh rims to cup
I got my stacks follow suit

Money ain't a thing
I live my dream so far
Call the cops on your in-laws
And they future dead don't know
When you finally come to terms with reality
Turn your back on your mission and embrace life after hoops

Like my 1 percent challenge
You need to show your true colors
With your limitless assets
You could make it to the round
Shootin up not one (oh) but two (redo sum)

And each time

You just gotta stay on top
You just gotta keep making sure that nobody is catching

Official black!

Been doing this for years
I still find it difficult to stop
Tell that not to happen again

My restless years are making me question my worth
I must fight for what is right

When I think back to when I was a teen

Busted even though I was a teen
Everyone I know is flawed
Everybody looks like them
I should start selling weed

They would be super cool just like myself

I would radically change the future

I should build a better world

Better than any
The only people who would listen to me if I was giving away free junk food

Now I live in the future where every thought is a dream
