Hugo Dabotquez was inspired to start taking drugs because he was afraid
He was raised Catholic and found out that God hates murder
He tried buying a home but was rebuffed by the IRS
His new boB bought him a new Domain name
He raised a family by himself and now runs a small business
He knows how to spend a life, consume less
His body wants to be loved, but it ain't always so
Its up to us to make a difference
