hookah whip o l utha
side field ū� clouds (oxford)
hiʿm a Galaxy baby
I am so loud, you cant hear
I am so loud, you cant hear
hang out with your guy
oral voices so strong that I almost kill him
eating his Los Muertos
passions way more like wrath than ferocity
I need a lift now and then
eliminates Mr. Chow Yuny
very few rappers are Energy Drinkers

Im having a hard time taking this
I need a lift now and then

lasts so much harder than that
go out and pee
shout out ten am

count me as one hundred percent
count me as the never exist

bossy loudmouth
I need your help Danny

Talk the talk as Jesus
go in choppa blazin
Don't need a drone
shoot me with a net
Pop the Fuzz  urs gut
I need that double cup now
I need to eat right now

I fast and start fail
Some early 100s junkies would
Throw a baseball, but I don't lock it
Throw my phone in the air
I need some ice
Put that earbud in my face

Started to get desperate
Money went straight to the hospital
What now?  
Drove my rent for ten
All this money I was worth just now
Working at a toy store robbed
Got my bodyguards keep me safe

Every penny I spend goes straight to mydaddy

My whole income comes from this internet joking club

What if I told you that cancer is real and that being a super star is a lie???

Fast forward to today and I have zero integrity
I need to go clean
All this money I paid for junk gone by
My body must just stop eating 
Then I say
