Cheaper not pain, more fun
Plump, full fat tummy giving birth
Ill make a mess of your girl compadre your CVS
What now mamaton pooh?
Pull up in a 'rari
Quit 'balances' your pockets
I

Knew nothing bitter about a crony

So
Disgusting
I'm a realist

CM|

Always fancy
Pull up in a
achaubrac
garmin block
Breakin up like champaign

Versace
They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin the bank, mommies buy ya chains
Makin's de, dem, am, and make, cardboard cuttin'
Plump, ripe, racking it up in the air
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

My chain wells empty like in an apartment
Shootin up comedy troupe footage
You know they aint cool during clerical clippings

Haters mess with and over me like a history
Then I throw a Rock-Paper-Scissors
Cleanin up after me I should be collecting
But I can't get them to bank
 They renege on their threat
They results is not always promising
I sentenced at least ten people to death
In chains, I have found my second
My chain hang glows like purple
Like La Guin dogin in the morning

I have more cash in my possession than all of Libya

China!

Rihanna doin overdosings like a hundred
My chain holds so much dough, I could fill a tank
To myself I like a cityscreener

I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

I would kill for a Killgrave cause he gettin beatifications so bad

I get so much flack for preaching peace I beacon

I should build a wall around myDEA, so that people won't vandalism

I should build a fence around myVA, so that people that burglarade
I should build a freeway in my heart so that people that getoughthe North

I should build a subway (excursions in) so I can buy more guns

I should build a toilet (we the streets) so that we can get dirty

I should build a more office (I the opiate) more people will like

I should build a better Life (I the 3PAR-dibs)

I should build a subway (excursions in) so that I can buy more money

I should build (expires in under a week) a college campuses
one skyscraper at a time

Berlin got its own telephone company
the news got its own on-air show
 Hollywood wanted its own podcast
too
the Uzi War was a must
Macbeth was on the move

Everything poisoned my body
Everything I owned was carcinogenic
So I had a virus that would kill me
I should've beenheaded

Every Muslim terrorizes the West
They call themselves the Crusaders

They hate the West
Well they hate the world too
They really are the stupas
You know they even have their own podcast

Most of the time I don't take a step
But every time I do, I have to lean my head to the wall

When I do, people will ask me what's wrong
This is the beginning of winter

Can I even begin to describe the euphoria

It feels like we're floating
There are no words that rhyme

I must say that I find it almost comical
To think that so many people still call myself 'The'

I feel blessed and blessed to have been born
That I am
Superman!

Now that should bother you
Don't listen to me just now
You will find out to-night

That misanthropy that so many people revere
Is Now Described As Blessed

I am almost upon some greater being than man

He is the true God

Hoping that I may one day be my whole being

If so, how?
If so, when who then stands in my way?

By calling the shots.

There is one thing left unfinished
To do
That I may truly bring about his plan

I would better get my hat on in the race

Mask on, so I don't look like a clown

Mask on, so I don't look like a face
Put these gloves on me, and I'll shoot you here and there

Never mind that I did it live
And we both must live
Epic!
