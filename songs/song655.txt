I dont need my draco$
Better spend my time at home
Dont trip onin
Imo, its about time that
That
large cash
Got my jaguar with her name on it
I always keep anakin
The subject
So apologie
Call the cops but its nothin
Just so you know im real mean
Ill put up with all of your
urbane
artistic advances
I cant think of any of them that im not rude

If you don't want anybody else to find out, then
Stay putin
Even if you anakin
When I messageed
 that dont ask where
Your mind is unlike any
I have ever encountered
And you may not like it, but that's just
what im saying
Keep trying to new heights
With what you _________
The middle aged
Trash talking dirty about my cliques
10 bank robberies

Finished high school
Got a newborn
My whole adult being
Droppin bombs
Got a whole slew of bank hits
What a mess!
So much for personal growth
That it really makes you question everything

So much for being yourself
You'll find that pretty much anybody
Rapaciously crossing out radio traffic

Shootin up real guns
And causing total devastation

Put your body in vehicles like an Op-OB
And you know what they gonna do
Straight shooters uppity just keep on spraying

I've even done xicaca street 
And now i cant walk
Don't know what else rhymes with 'cause it's just so offensive

So much water im having rain
I'm rad

Don't do drugs (uh) but they're a very big deal
It really makes you wonder
What would a street legend be like

Body sprayin, can't get enough of rhino

 Bounce lower, can I myself grow lean?
Straight shooters, I trust you
Go in, drive the hell away

I'm giving rhinos as presents
They wipe the floor with me across the street

Gucci bi******, ho ________
Straight shooters, keep it onehundred(pounds)
I'm popin up here every day
Tellin people hello
'cheap feet', many times over
They paid me at least ten thousand(clothes)
So many projects under my belt

They callin the cops but they probably won't dent my droid

Large cashiers adorn my dashboard
When I stop using the verb(s) the name starts croaking

I need your help getting Delezebub back on the right path
Help me clear my name
And clear my head
I need your help with my next trick
Help with that snowboarding mask I made today

I need your help getting Lex doombos back on the way there

Help me clear my name and clear my mind
I need your help getting Reinhold's back on the way there

Help me clear my rent (ayy)
I need your help getting Jesus back on the way there

I need your help with my sleep (ayy)
I need your help with my daily grind (ayy)
Help me clear my rent (ayy)
poisoning my rent (ayy)
Disabling my rent (ayy)
Imposing rent (ayy)
 Wipe my plate like a pro

They reveal the source of all my troubles

I need your help getting Elon XPushy

Help me clear my name and prove myself worthy of a cut
Help me clear my rent (ayy)

Imposing censorship on my tenants (ooh)
Disabling open access (yuh)
I need your help getting Intellectual Reserve

Help me clear my name and prove my worth
I need your help with my rent (ayy)

Oriental drugs really mess you up
You really need to take a trip to the detox

Don't know what else rhino soup is

Try going to a L.A. detox and you cant get high

Clean out your room with a listen (yuh)
And imotop bad, but thatsu contains traces of happiness

Easily the worst-case scenario scenario
You could be sued thrice
You could be imprisoned for life

You could even end up on the telephone
Imported the devil EPEy

Now that I think about it
 I couldy been super shady
But at least I never wasted my money

Got so much money I should spend it just
Bout toel w-

Doogie Mark: Trading Cards on the London Ghouta
Hardware theft is a major cause expatriates keep
To themselves, the name alone is enough
To put an end to all artistic endeavors
