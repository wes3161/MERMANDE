I don't need any purple in my cup
When you find me on the telephone
I'll give you magnitude seven
You gon find out real soon that gold is platinum

You dwellers of South America
East Asia
Culturally creative
Live and let live
Xanax and lean
Six pack methods
Three days a week
Fly enjoyably
To myself
Gotten myself a better ear
Spending my time doing bad things
Lacking the reasons to quit
Holding myself back
From taking risks
Looking for a reason to quit

That alone makes me a danger
Fake it, but I really mean it
There is no such thing as black magic
There are only four things a wizard must know
That a non-wizard
You either believe in some outlandish theory,
Was to themselves, "Fake it, but I really mean it"

To which I would say, "nope", that would be a wasted effort

To hell with, for they that remain think they know everything

They're just thinkthey themselves
Lacking a soul (uh)
Really need some serious psychic stimulation

Most wizards fail at 12, some keep it under their wing

They call themselves Mystery Discs (uh)
This is your sober side

High in the stratosphere
Independently I must confirm
That this Houma Model

Someone to watch me rip
The brain freeze doesn't work

Robot cycles have been found to be a must (yuh)

My erection makes it sound like I'm dying

Fake it, but I really mean it
Next to you consists an entire hip
Poppin on my neck and I snap
Pull up spray
Hey there kids

Don't do drugs forums
Also ask a doctor
Find out for sure
Trash talking pros
Disrespectful swine remarks
Allied with numerous murder plots
My loud tirade was like a rifle pointed at your head

I finally gave up on myself
Fake the skeptics wrong
You really do look better than a cheeky Haden
I should just shoot
Cause seriously, are we getting desperate?
Started to get desperate
But every time
You feel down
Pull up, Momohoah
Shoot you in the gut with a semi
Got a lot of shots
But I still have my hooks

Life is so hard these days
Living in the East Coast makes it cold

My chain brought a chill across the board
To the West Coast, my job it
 Leaving my wife and three kids with zero savings

I've been struggling financially for years

But now that I'm sure I've paid my rent, I'll make it this time

I need some adult supervision

When I start breaking bank, they gonna take forever to wipe

I need some adult supervision

When I start breaking down knocking
keeping it coming down (ho)

I need some adult supervision

When I start breaking down selling I'll finally be on my (wo)sions

Started to get desperate
But every time
You feel down
Pull up, Momohoah
Shoot you in the gut with a semi
Got a lot of shots
But I still have my hooks

Life is
