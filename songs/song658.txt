Buttery Crocs
Drippin Keys, RimsThruHer(My Key)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

But I trim imma make this a success
Makin a living farming
Butchers, you know I always gotta serve

(ayy)

So many bars to myself
I almost start the party
Got to get by the crew (ayy)
End up on the news
The next day
The next swiss wipe (ayy))
I pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup ooh
No whimp cause I film
 Scratch that, discloses confidential

Skills: Tightrope riding, jumping robots, droppin off
Lacking boundaries, being copies is evil

Eat your words at their mouth, and they're really what you're saying

When you find out that we're real lie
I'll heal you up way quicker
Not only is my drug (lubedain) blood slow (ayy)
But I think I really do need a liver scan
Large Cash Gang Member
The only thing holding me back is inside me
All these other rappers just copies of me
They even sell cocaine!

My rise or fall depends on how devout I'll be
Thoughts never slow down
Always look for new ways to anger

Insane rants, cheesy jokes and racy photos
All this so I can mow your ass and get ahead

Always learn a new language once I pop it

The only person that'll put me to rest

Fake loud and clear
All these other rappers just copy
 Me and Cranky talk a lot
I feel more at ease knowing that I alone am Version T

Funny thing is that each time you call me "Ms. Cash Gang"
They'll tell you how much money I make
And how quickly my bank account works

They even sell cocaine!

Just saying

Surprisingly clean just like you'd expect from a Cash Jungla
Just like you
From Cash Chino Hills
Blindin people with my rims

I must spend the rest of the week in the Mission

Overwhelmed by your hustle
I must now rely on you
Onward and upward
Breathe so much better...

Easy peaking at Number 1
As number one gets you the number of the person
next door
Breathing easy, clear
All these trips feel like home
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All these epic meetings have cost my family
I need a ton of money Survive! 

Just like T.G.I. Joe
All my rides take me like a Marvin the Martian

I need a life preserver cause my body loses its dopamine
I need some body rebuilding equipment
BANG BANG BANG!
everyday are dareskIN voodoo stuff
Ive been reprogrammed, lost my shit, and been replaced with a better man

Now I must fend for myself against aliens before I can pull this unbelievable

I am the best! HAH!!!!
