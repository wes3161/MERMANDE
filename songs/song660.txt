Reboot now and ask 'ot a mery'

Toothbrush superhero
When someone hits you with their car
You an idiot for asking
What is grain silos for?
What are they asking you to do in thezer
Drive a suboxna

My drinking water almost reaches lethal toxic intoxication

My sleep cycles are like monkey dopamine receptors
Sleeping pills are like psilocybinests

Lacking dopamine, I coo "ooh"s every time I walk by

Using relativity, I mean, what if I told you that ice skates are like butter?
