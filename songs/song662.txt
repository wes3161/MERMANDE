Launch Scramble on target identifying they are a team
My sniper ain't with me makin hits, its about a football Its up to you these are the pros

Go in choppers, aim, it go (yuh)

pull up, lengthy
stuff like
a STAFF
gangnam stylegangland
gangways
sell sandwich bags
gang (stick)

styrene
a must for any good bouncer

hiphop is child’s play
61`s are not worth a single listen
Lyrics are fraudulently derived
From child wax, slang for child (yah)
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz
Then I pull up in the rari
With my shooters you'll be sorry

My armory, expansive
My catapult aint passive
Tha barret is be massive
My draco is jurassic

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Lipity loppity
momidy robbity
 tongue so floppity
hippity hoppity
 Me llama you a comedy
IQ bring homogeny
 words long verbosity
Looking for a mamatree
Got five doggie -ees
Made 100 milli Gs
Got cash floe reppin T’s
My hoe got sum lean
My body wants to pee
Leaking the 7 seas
urine smells like codeine
Really bad hygiene
To myself im real mean
I hate the rap scene
Fake rappers are memes
Gucci bursting at the seams
Clean as heck make wet dreams
Jet fuel can't melt steel beams
(question everything)
(why was thermite found at ground zero)
(real stuff)

Help im having a stroke

I consume more protein than five chuck norrises
My weight is greater than an entire tyrannosaurus
I’ll clear you out like a four-course porridge
I have enough fat for four years of storage

Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see
Hella grape juice, clear pee
Trigger femmies make em REE (ree!)
Im lacking hella vitamin D (YEET)

Haters mess with me and i sit on them (dab!)
My whips go fast, max the RPM (skrrt)
My sleep cycles are devoid of REM (nyquil)
Lacking dopamine imbalances my biochem (help)

Drop you with the stendo clip (ayy)
