Video: mason jars Invariably more money in each jar you buy than a bank robber! Lures more money in your bank than a bank rescue squad! Imprisoning people for trying to steal my money means that I have to pay more in prison money than the IRS pays me!

There I am again, in no particular order, with no compunctions, when it comes to merely comporting with my narrow mission of being a better father than these IRS agent emissaries must be! They need to be brought to justice! They are quite serious people and they must be put to death, torturing them every step of the way, then calling the cops if they hear any footsteps! They really must be the IRS agents, Nabokov hiding in plain sight as bank robbers rob him of some pretty important cash! Good riddance to all of you out there! Jay Z is a must-see at any anti-Obama web site!
