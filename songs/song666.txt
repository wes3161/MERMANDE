So many people strip

|-----------------------------------------------------------
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Lacking hunger, I like sandwich shops

To myself, that really shows
Woolworthies

Drip drip drip drip
Drop lipsticks wet Im already pouring Doll Michelle
Shoot yo house in the gut with a mace

I got a lot of watches and batteries
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

Pullin up in that spaceship
Cause I need my personal space
Pullin up in that Benz
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in in that Forest

Pullin up in that Jeep
Pullin up in in that M3
Pullin up in that slug
Pullin up in that radio
I got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates
I should build a bigger grill so I can get enough water

I need ice skates sooner than later
I need ice skates more later

Pullin up in that cruise ship
Skewer my at traffic like Omarinia<|endoftext|>You know I always gotta stay strapped, so I better get some glasses on
Nothing beats being ONTALK

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Lipity loppity
momidy robbity
 tongue so floppity
hippity hoppity
 Me llama you a comedy
IQ bring English
 Wrist so massive that you almost slip
Miraculously, you survived
Quadruple vision disadvantage
Can't really listen to music because I'm so busy laughing
Lets eat sacrificial porridge
We the beggars at the bank
What do you want, pop?
First try, gospel
For love, sex, and love
What set me on fire

First love, vegetarianism
For love, sex
Livin high society
Dont let anyone beat you
They may not like you, but not them
They never will
They never will

Livin a new house 2x as good
Less crime, faster updates
Better sleep
Tha less stress you have

Better weight, less anxious people
Better relationships, happier people
Better cholesterol, blood flow
Better bone density
Better aint you ever noticing
Rest in Lil Peep

This aint hacked, no neurotic just gone b*tch on by
Get out here, dawgs
There go the battery packs
The internet, thehaslane

Don't need any meds
Just enough adrenaline to last
Don't need any think tanks
Just enough schizophrenia for I am
So much more than just some junk
