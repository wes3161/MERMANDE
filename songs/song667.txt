Out here killin posers like a causeist the system flowes aw
Know your way around baitin us seriously
All these other rappers are messiah doctrines
All these platinum plaques are evidence that we are real
All these watches are markers of class
What a travesty of the human heart to think we can achieve anything

Do you even need proving
Imos in the floor all these diamonds

I need a life preserver that I can trust

They also brought with me bank warrants
You know I always gotta stay strapped
Ready to go when the fighting starts

Callin my crew and tell 'em we aint cool
Good shootas right here in my bar

Shootin like im 1,0002 hits of amI
Got a lot of reverb

Shootin like im 23 freaking sixcents

Most rappers nowadays are cribblers

Most rappers nowadays are crackheads
Most rappers nowadays are dumbbesks
I got thatigator in my face all day
All these other rappers are assholes with rec pens
Don't need no rap show
I got all this reverb
Got a lot of reverb

Turned pro five times
Finished pro sixfold
Now I bemoan rap

Robbed rent on the street
Tha old man came go hard

Got it worse than a cold
Seeked my wife twice as much as I did
As a side job I send everybody bankrupt

Pull up to that house
Pull up in that truck
Got a load more than my cap
Got a glove more than my cup
Got a trigger finger more than my pocket

I have a lot of sobriety, but not like this
Droppin rap like I was a film
Put my body in a car compactor
And pick up just like a call
The party is over
The party is starting to rain
 Heavy it makes my spleens ache
I need a life preserver that I can trust
Waitin at the bank
They askin where im being robbed
Im playin life reverse
You know how its supposed to be
Im playin life reverse

I got a lot of money, but you know it not enough

All these other bars just daf shake
