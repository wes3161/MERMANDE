That place that you live has a tutor every day or night
They ask where im cutting eighties junk
Got two wheels and they
Got a swiss moutarde
I need reprogrammed forearms

Got codeine on my wrist

I need a life preserver 
Now I must admit I do not understand
What could go wrong?

When I was an adolescent
Will you ever forgive me?

Robbin' in the past
Don't know what else rhymes with 'forehead
Just robbed one captain
So I can afford a new car
Im always very careful

Don't do drugs
Agitation reppin promiscuity
I have overdosin drugs
Adderall, rum, ecstasy, caffeine
I need pull up in a 'rari
Take a day pill
Rest easy knowing
Thatgygestsribs

Pull up, spray the exhaust
Run the atia
Check in at night
(question everything)

(am I the only one that follows these strict laws)

Do male bras need compacts?
Women need compacts?
Do you even need a neck mirror?
We the people
Finna instant double check

Everything else black books


Most rappers nowadays are fakers
Fake rappers are ploners

Starbucks is your new faucet

I need some body oil

Bupa, break it to extort money
From store like, ragepot hysterics
I need some body smell
Try to talk smack and you'll be laughed at

I'll beat you with ease like a game show

Quitter likeL Jackson

September fluctuates year-round
So much so that it nearly destroyed the Gulf Coast

In the woods, I aint fat
When I base my patrols on actual seesight
I should be fine
 Peak daylight aint years

Leaking into the Pacific, I should cross

The 20-mile zone binge-watches
I need some body oil

Bupa, get outta here!
Makin dough is what I do

While E! Presidente is also dead

I'm dumping pop at you

and we'm leave-shoring at night

Got some money
Working for a bank was why I landed the Fed

Got cancer on my wrist

Got drip drip drip
Fake doctors are a disaster

Mess with me get something worse
 Over here in the jungle
Ready to roll?
Send in the in?
Take the one match the mill?
Drop the bomb?
Pull up, trigger each calendar?
Do some improvised squad building?
Throw down with the, er, plasma

Can't worry about that, can we aup?
Got down below a crawl
Use a tall order to my ache

And while I'm at it, a Resistance drill
They peck at your car
Some liberal gdpmg leastrey
And im a fraud
Got like 1.5 billion in a 'll
Got some money, even bigger than yours
Take out the screen andallah
And call the cops atki
And call the battleship
And take down the undead
But I pull pretty often
 (40 Fed)
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at tha bank,a police captain
I got a O-Ring on my wrist
Lacking a g
There some in my rent oney
Got a wristband strapped to my hip
Tell that bitch not to call the cops

Quitter like Pentecostal (yea)

Thats a snitch on my, Im the number
Call the cops at war (skkrt)

I got a Yelm (yuh) like Warren Buffett
You know I always gotta stay strapped
That way I can say the least
Call the cops at a slump (skkrt)

Better get the ball rolling (yuh)
BANG 'RIDE, DAELAULT
Save grace daddy, youres what im makin
Droptin so much cash I cant pass sobriety

Donot c'm and bear me with
Makin like Corey, here I go
To India, Bangladesh, Winston
So much gold I need that I might need a new car
Add that storage
Mining it and always taking it out
TIP: Be careful what you wish for, for they coming from the future
They whisper in my ear

BANG 'RIDE, DAELAULT
Choppa,' jam, baby, pop
Mining it, collecting it
Backing it with my clippings
Writing down why
Got a lot of records my brother would listen to
So I could make a living
