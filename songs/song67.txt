
So i came across your on the go store
Got some fine platinum that youre selling

They shipped in boxes full of blazin
Im a cold blooded killer, raw ballin
All these and many, many, many, many
I just need some heroin
So im out here making mixtapes
 We got guns, holsters, or is that replayin on your radar
Working with some of the most hated haters in the game
You'll never see me surrender

Turn your weight not on your head that I need you dead
Hold up makin dough
Everybody put their feet up in the street
I aintazy we need your help ainthot

That's one hell of a rap album

Wallet down, double that flow
Don't do drugs warmly
Most rappers nowadays are fakers, they bakeries

Drug dealing make really, really messiahs

I was raised indoors but grew to love the outdoors

Walkin in boots of gold
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They askin where im from and what im talking bout
I just bought a yacht so im the captain now
I got so much money I could buy the Dow
Got the stendo clip and I aint never play around

Better watch what you say fore I snap
Roll up on yo crib and we go brat-a-tat-tat
Thats one for your head two for knees three for your back
Always keep in mind that snitches always come in last 

Blindin people with my rims when I roll down the street
Resturant bill be longer than a CVS receipt
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

Everyday im out here grindin stackin up that paper
You a minor league but I be ballin like the majors
All these watches never time for any haters
Always rise above it cause I take the elevator

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I got a Guada Cabral LS
Dishonest cops like a cowhide
Thats one for your head two for knees three for your back
Always keep in mind that snitches always come in last

Killin three billion dollars you site candy on my wrist

Makin dough, all I gotta do is grind it
Disaster on my farm so I can feed my kids

I got a Murcielago on my wrist that I can stash under my arm

They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Better watch out cause imup in so many cases

I got a Murcielago on my wrist that I can stash under my arm
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put some dolla dolls on
Mask on, boutta put some dolla dolls on
Pull up in that Lamborghini
Pull up in that Lambo
Pull up in that black Benz
Pull up in in that white Ghost

Pull up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa snack like calamari

I got a Guada Cabral LS
Dishonest cops like a cowhide
Thats one for your head two for knees three for your back
Always keep in mind that snitches always come in last
