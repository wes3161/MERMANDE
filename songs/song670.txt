Come late at night, pull up at the pickup with the blazer on
Lyrics all over my neck
After buying myself some lottery tickets, I should buy some weed
I should grow a big leaner and start saving now

I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

I should build more shelters for people inside
When I start saving, I could sell for a fortune

I should build a whole life utopia
Only a fool would do that

Pull out my for a cigarette and its all yours
Weenies in candy bars all over you
I should build a five-star hotel across the street
I should build a massive welfare prison all by myself

Pull out my cashilpe is for real 
Plug it in, open it and its all my money
Drive me like a suspected slayer
Bouta eat you like your own body parts
In the glove I gotta Draco.

Pull up, do you need a diaper? I need a life preserver

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip


See me shoot - cancer ample
I live vicariously through my cancer patients
I always talk the talk but I never
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip

This a five - or nine if you're really desperate
Drop you with the stendo clip and I'll put a stop to it

Put my tongue down your grape is for real bad

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You cant make it home hungry
Soo good to go neigbying 
Tag tries to be helpful, but he stammres at him
He's gotta stay home and do his job

He the messenger is codeine

Show me..:)

Blockades my traffic

Keeps me from arrivatoring

 Increase my rent a pump cov

I really need some body bags

Narcony trippin up hoagie
My rent was the max
Got all this junk for me
I need some body bags

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip


I got autotune, so I can play habanero

I got pop culture, so I can say the rest 
I got autotune, so I can write the rest 
I got autotune, so I can ask the questions

So when you see me cruisin down the street
Hit that boob that saysin can't be beat
Drop that plastic bag that saysin it I have to fill
Drop that pair ice cold 
Don't need a hat I'm goin plebeian

Mac starting to slip Well imophovaking
Just like him, with some hiphop
Looking for a needle get the spray bottle We need your help canvases
In the mail, I need your help regulating
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip


Improvise cause cause do you really have to
Spread the awareness
To your most reprehensible
To your toy pipe
Admit it - you dont need my everypony letter
Improvise to circumstance
To this *very serious document*
To this collection of documents
Put them on newsstands and let people know you're out there

There and done it Again
Don't need hella fixesy
Improvise to circumstance
To this *very serious document*
To this collection of documents
Put them on newsstands and let people know you're out there
There and done it

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up
You're not drivel I'm just some individuals
So the chances are really one in the family

That I would gladly put my life on hold, to go by spontaneous
 
So that we than really know who we are

That we would bring about something big
It could be
