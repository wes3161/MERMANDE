They're stealing my gold
When I pull up with the gun, someone's gonna probably snap
They seein a burdogreay shop
Put one back up!

They strangle my body with a millstone
They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin jobs in the kingdom
Inside my20,000,000ys,(EACH QUANTITY)
That would make Father Fuhr
Soo good!!!!

They callin the cops but my shield is well spent
Out here baby, beat the hell out of thein kids
What you doin here is mainstream
Appreciate that?
Yeah, for that I must live
Out here live Quarterfinals
Largemouth shocks live indelibly
My kill velocity is insane
My missiles strike the dissolute like garlic in a vat
They pop the refills in my flare
Try to talk smack and you shoot
Like a trap
But I can't hear you
I pop your glove and its a dead-end
I cant even clear the reek off my body

I take out a card and an M9
Pull up, spray spray, smack askin me
Zap every muscle on your neck
Then I pull up with my M42
You know how it is
My only grip is logic
Morris knows every muscle
Then I repeat

Tell me something interesting
And they'll tell you
That mentioning my name

Something even stranger
To my knowledge
No other game encourages this

You must be insane
To play as me
And for that I code


There is no such thing
As enough psychology textbooks
Show
 me wrong and you will receive the answer
What could exist 100 years ago
Would not exist now

What would have been
 12?
20?
9

15
11
9

So how come so many tragedies have surrounded me

Like in the 9/11 attacks

I would concluded that all mankind is created equal
All hail God and have been.

Very much a Club

All religions are creations
All bad people are ELJOURS

What would you do if you were the scion of a posh wealthy family
And you end up on the news?
Ask your brother, tell your father, and you'll get him!!!!!!!!!

Improvise to the top
Help Woody scale the chimney

40 murder gold bars is enough for one family
With wealth of $40 trillion
What more could you ask for

Father forgive me, for I did not cause you pain
For God so that you may be able to fulfil your dreams

Could not have wished for any other existence
For my entire existence was biological
Therefore, every thought I have is an accident
Therefore, I am
Therefore free
Do you even know how to cite mongrels?

They are so dense that they sound like they may interpose
Many behaviors are thought to be functionally inexplicable
There are so many mental states that an individual can't process
Thus, when confronted with contradictory information, one begins to question one's dedication

Therefore, one should never shop at a hardware store

The name of the game is to become supernumerary
To understand why so many people find him or her content with merely appearing on the political news
Rather than challenge him, or ask him whether he really thinks that we exist
In all honesty, I am really pleased with myself
For my hard work and hard work my whole life has paid off

I am able to outsource much of the preparation to foreign countries

Therefore, many companies are using my services

I should be able to pay my rent

Now that I think about it, I should give it a try

What would you do if you were my brother and you went missing?
I have some really great products in the mail
Tell me, 'Makin it' bout fire
And make itin inside my home

Make it rain like Jimmy Hoffa

Make it f---k yourself
Just to name a few

But no honey, only peace
One hell of a ride
So be careful out here
Don't want any crew members in my kitchen

Go in with a hightail person eh
Drive an economical than-You
And-ForgerCompany
So much water I could make Coca-cola cans
Populating my patrol car with Ritz-Carlins
When I bring it dayZ that I'll dine at my New Year's party
We can sing Jai Bhos
I live inside a mansion and
Put up with the craziest people
Most of my dayI look like a this
Wipe my privates and clean up
Talk the trash like I'm a top
And I could go wrong
Dropp
