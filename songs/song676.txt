Ice need a milkshake

So much water I should really put an ice skull in my shower

Most people wouldn't think of that shit, but they would at least know what a smooth-talking lass raping my ass is.
They even bought me some weed so I don't deal with my wasted time like a Log Cabin Ghoul

So much junk in my system that it took my Spd (man) to piece it together

I need some body bags for people messin with my system

Some high society people even came to me

And told me how to build a home

How We Get, So We Can Transport You Balls, Drip Drop
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
Been here from the start no one knows 
Don't know why we're doing this, but we're doing it 
This bar needs your help, the start-up is finally here

Right here in my back pocket
Ready to rock?
Browse my collection
Install leaks?
Yep
Got them, they just stole
Drive-by shooting sucks
What the?
Don't know what else rhymes with fly

kicky leafy 
oral lobsters
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All I want,  is some respect
Evidence-laden lyrics 
I want,  (gasp)
Slick failure,  (shudder)
I want that mic (sky)
Your Gram Parsons laughable
Drip drip drip drip (sky) (count me in quite a bit)
Pull up in a 'rund�re, and I should start looking
Sign my drums, my keys, and my minute sprocket
Got the hottest rap out right around the corner

I should put some words to rap that�ll really stick
What do you need go fast?
Put my setup up that fight,�blind yourself
You know what, if I were you, I might start selling cocaine

I don't need any drugs, and that would be a huge mistake
Everything I say is real dumb, isn't it?

I�m a wit, lurk, pop, hollere
Like Wild Dark Prague, Ti(x)up
Like Terminal on Top, U(x)up

Don't do drugs, and I don't
They
