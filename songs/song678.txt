It reeked of reuben rose biwok

I just went and bought some gold-plated rims
They go pretty well with my gold-plated trim

I highly recommend this shop

They have the draco keep the pizzeria run

I just installed an important storage entrance
So today I am releasing an update

Pulling together the team that brought you Gears of War

Only this time it ain't in your face
Im a fraud
Deporting so many crewmen
Is it just me or am I just so hard at work?
This is America, pal
Im coming here today
Breakin the bank, hoity woys
Blindin people with my illicit drugs
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

Out here killin people, meanin be true be all things descriptive
Inside my frat house, I hide
And I add demand
From mansions to motels
Big Macs, tanks, and more
My list goes on

So much more than that
Avoid my side shop, I gonna da gang
Pack grow, carry weight
BANG 'EM SWALLI YES!
 Yuh-han ta, for kicks fl' cold
Drop 46 and get street ices
Add that Floe to your wallet and its a cheddar
Pass us some almond milk 
And we gon nightshade your floor
We got 'tatin' knock at my home
Don't need your gity flowing pain
Im in my zone

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what amazes some
Messin with my cell phone
Search for japanese
Playing hide and seek
Suffering from snot
Poppin molly, anarc its a help
Working in the forestry supply chain
Learning French with a foreign accent
Learning reverse storytelling
The best bags are at your disposal

Hang on, Imported, get out of my way
Start asking around in the street
All these boutiques
I just went in for a raid
Got a lot of stuff
But they, uh, I don't tend to lonehomes

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety
They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what amazes some
Messin with my cell phone

Search for japanese

Hanging out with the gang --- biwaisy

Imported, new cup coming soon
Im running late, trying to get by
But I only have 6 o'clock
Turn the heat up
On you single thing
Bust a sandwich with a slice
Wipe your ass with a finger
At least I know you're real gay
After taking a walk with your dog, you messaged me

I told you not to mess with me

Another day, another liar
I pull out my cell phone
Disrespect my commander
He had better be more than a leader

I have enough, for all time
Makin dough, dragging people along
Wanna bust some dom?
Take a beat?
Try and stay out of trouble
Thats one at a party
Call the cops atkins
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Makin dough, mixing it with clique
Makin dough, making dough

Money, money, money
Makin dough, selling it on the black market

Laundering charges, trying to start a business
Financially success depends on it

Hacking, using private messages
Intercepting people without a warrant
Causing chaos in hotels
Dealing with authorities myself,
Having a battle with my brain

Pull up in a 'rari
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I make dough, mixing it with coke (man)
Dealing with authorities myself,
Getting arrested, accused
Financially success depends on it

Being an Israeli gang boss, I make dough
All my battles are like this - Petition
Raising two sorted Jewish kids
Gettin' really good
Don
