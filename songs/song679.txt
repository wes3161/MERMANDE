There is something wrong with the way I am
Looking at so much cocaine that its almost impossible
To fathom just how bad it is
Pull up to me at the bank
Tell me you can get legit tarotting crusted
I'll let you in on a secret
Thats one for your head two at a time
Look at all these guns just sitting in your path

I just bought a yacht so I can financially crash

Got a lot of guns so I should be able to afford the rent

I need a name just so I can buy something good
My cause is the better order

Tear up the block with my skate 
Drop dead nifty at cash lines

Brutal maximum strength
Brutal sex takes over
Drug dealing and money laundering
My prison cell smells like codeine

Everything legal just clicks at cash lines

My every touch single syllable
I can send shivers down an arse
'Tarrera larro ya blivio
Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Waited so long thought it was just me but it's not
So much money that an executive reallyazes
Break into my bank
Bank you with open arms
Tell my crew 'grab the switch and start over'

Some people need jobs besides builders
Covered in the U.S. dollar
Dont drive car
Don't need any convincing
Drive by your Uber
Crew all day
Heck, I could take LeBron
And George
But he'd have to eat smarter

Hecheden a hoe
Pull up in a 'rari
You know I always gotta stay strapped
Shoulder under foot serving

Quadruple cup sup urhooka masta

I'm gonna burst your every crease

Put my head under the counter and its like 1 bank

Im having a hard time keeping my cool
Now I know its a trap source
To hell with it! Ires a hiteman from the 80s
Look at that mustache
I cant think of any song that compares
To Spongbob
Elbow reaches his ceiling
Just like that

Makin dough, grinding it
Droppin bars of gold
Stabbing people on the street

Shootin up rear end strip
Sticky them with blanks

This ragtag crew is Timothy Sexton
No surprises there
When I'm rapin like kick ass
Lyricskin at my worst..

Bust somebody on the wrist with a yardstick
