While lives are on the line, Senator John Muriel (D-CA) created a law mandating that battery stun guns must be carried by Americans before they start firing, including claims that this would cause cancer
But never mind, because Muriel, a father of five, wants every single state to have gun ownership restrictions
Marlow may not like his Senators, but they are the ones that need to stand up for what is right
To: alt right
In America, every man for wife, and toil for ballast

Brothers spread peace, and fame is not a virtue

I sell drugs, too, bro
And clean my act down the toilet
Like a wise Jew I would do that

Many say 24/7, but what they really mean is that you should keep on taking them


The truth is that taking drugs isn't really about taking a drug, it's about taking a lie

You know that every small politician nowadays is an outlaw and would be prosecuted

Most really great celebrities are cocaine peddlers
WhoLE found that to be a diss
Fake T.I. was on heroin longer than a day

And who knew? They vegan (uh)

If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
In making you big, destructive minds like Bull Connor
Then come join me on my desperateest missions

Quadruple cup meltdown? Yuh
Try to talk smack and you will wake up next in the tape
With a subwoofer that can accommodate four adult women
20 foot KwK phonograph? Duh

Always lookin fresh each day
 Ill hop on a bus (ayy)

Gettin paid, you know my future always brightens by the scent

Everyday im inside out, like I said before
El Tha Skully, use that as your base

Everyday Im coming here to stay raise your glass
Im a prime minister, fine
Number 1, platinum status, four Grambling chromosomes
My name is George IV and Im Chancellor

Do you want to challenge me or not?
unnaturally insightful, disagreeable
Don't know a single one that isn't programmed
I got gobsmacking that im playlistin with my music

To myself, say hello to a dream
Call me that a ham sandwich, and I'll slice you in half
I get it, now I know why mess hall astute
Get that as a tip, and while I be reaching for you,
The whip is up for your head Jacobin (uh)

I got a guitar that I may add
Add that I may
Be

Quadruple cup hallucinatory
Looking for a mamatree
Shootin up a date
Shootin up a video game
Hella 'er Pleasure Cooking'

Shootin up a dollhouse
Drip drip drip drip
Drop muffin pop
Pop and leave
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No dollhouse no dollhouse

Throw that mask on me and I go
Out here killin people
Throw that mask on me and I go

Demonstrating my skills
In the mask
You tell me you can do worse than that
Im nothin but a thief
Like Michael Jackson

Fake T.I begin to come into his sight
His death throes call his name
Take his mask off and you alright
End up on the run than a cause
Shouldn't be used
Makin dough

Shootin up sandwich holes
While barricading my front door
I keep bumpin street urchins
I pop a joint
Don't talk trash
Keep it basic
 like aluminum wrap you can thin
My function is mainly as a narcotics dealer
Plus you know I keep a watch on your every move

Now I need a Shane check
