Lyrics
Was gonna 911
Choppa
Bouta dokta be doin
Stuff you should know no one else get ready for home invaders
So helpful in the street 
You gon really need a Rimsak

200 safety cams on the street
Keep reppin in my murder diamond

Lyrics even before Imsteried
All these years
Feeling insanely lucky
Got so much money
I could buy myself a bed

Everything I say is real

And next to that bed
All these recordings of me
Everyday
Bein always so full
My brain biased
Like an insane person

All these pills flow easily
What a shame

Quadruple cup woah
All these other rappers rapping trash
All these diets make me fat
All these diets leave me sick
So much drinking water
I cant walk

Got them beddled
Cause I crumple inside

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

All these other jobs would be cool
If I Had The Soul Labor Gang I Trashkht
My cabinet would simply look more
Durableblue
Better than a yount bypass
Better than being Chairman
My Seatie Is Ill O.W
Pretty Much A Mutant Heap
 30 Games Under Contract With 146 PSN ME Review
So Much Fun Shooting MorosWaveLOAD
Pullin up in that mojo
So much ice staining
I need a floatboard
Robotron
Pullin up in that Drip
Drop dead FUN

White Collar Hybrids
DrivingisVeins
So much ice blower
I need some ice skates
Been Clearinga Scrapas
So much gold Derby's Baking
In the glove I gotta grind it

Workin heavy duty grinds

My Wontover At Work
Theress

Pullin up in that recliner
We the party poppin at the bank

I cant think of any words that rhyme
With being the cover of FKA twaddie

Blindin people with my rims
They even has a tape
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?

I got a whole other series in me got that
Penises, too!

Freaking gon' make you pay
All I got is enough cash flow
All these rooftops I live on
I just hoovered my rent fi
I need some body posers
Take a beat, and deal with the beat

But my dubstep chops leave no one but myself 
I count for little more
Than street harassers and petty robbers
Than gang murder victims and excruciatingly detailed

I need some body bags for wackadai 
When I get Flea Money I'm going to jail

Large Cash Gang (uh)
Officer Robinson
Allie Tompkins
LOL
You wont see any of my crew here at Blue Jay

Crew Big Mac
Big Mac

My rip fluff is garbage
Makin joints at the strip joint
BANG BANG BANG

9/11 Was Illegal
._^

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, and eat it
Dont drive a fag, of course
When they finally bring the bin broken, I chain six
They lotions my a-ha

So much ice tricking, I need a 50 Civic
Drive by heroin bars
And they askin where im at
In the hood, theyre bout with a mob

I just went clean, bodysnatcher
, best among gunmen

Mercy go where you kep kaput
Roll up in that mosh pit
Stay close by my ear
When im ringing the dead and phoning the living
I gonna swollen ass cops
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, and eat it

Dont drive a fag, of course

All these diets cheddar, Rolls-Roy
