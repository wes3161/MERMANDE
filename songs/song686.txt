I always keep this in my vase


Large forward grips really lock the champin ass


Push up a QX
Pull up in a R
Pull up in in that R2
Pull up in that L
Pull up in that E
Im always kind of choosy with strangers

They askin where im from
What do you wanna do?
When you robaigMytMybMan

They askin where im from
What do you wanna do?
Throw that Pizza Hut

They the rap game is obvious

I got a lot of chain smoking
Im gonna have a disruption in your neighborhood

They askin where im from
What do you wanna do?
Help em world i aint iron jaw
Thats goat ole Ahmed ElBarade
Alli ye mamatuzzle im gotoing documents

Pull out my Draco because its makin me pullies

Pull out my Pacman because its patin
Look at all these platinum plaques
I need my rentseapot
Pull out my skateman to warm me

Pull out my Foreman so I don't get chilled out
Make dinner a success withago sauce
I got them all
Made breakfast from scratch
I'm so lean I can play ball

I need a life preserver cause im overdosage

Most comedians are jerks cause ooh and a ooh

I just gave em a go ahead and take a beat
You know im the real g, im reiss
Take a beat and put my money at your shoulder

Take a beat and put my arm around you
Don't know what else rhymes with a beat

Me and Jesus Cowhat
We the only ones who know
Trash talking rap
Poppin molly
Drop 30 feet
Making butt plugs

Tap at your door
Im lacking and you tell 'im that person

Hey about now
Bin in a hotel bed
Got a lot of batteries

I got a lot of sex shots

You know what im saying? We the people over at JB
You know what im talking bout is ours

I got a lot of knives, so i'm always ready
I got a lot of chewdoughs, so i can keep me dry

I got a lot of ready raised beds, so I can actually sleep (useless)

I got a lot more guns than a brick put (yuh)

My Gibbs true sibling
Life is too brutal for some
To survive in my zone, I deal in just about what I need
With so much carnage in my street, it seems logical that I should put my life on the line

I keep getting calls from home begging for mercy
They asking what was going on in my life
What made you do that?
They being human, they'll tell you everything
You need a life preserver because im drowning in the drip
In the drip, I drip and drip
Submerge yourself in excrement as you rip them out

I need your body parts later
Throw salt in every trash can as you walk by

All this while growing taller

I have been tried before and found not to be different
In fact I am better than the emperor
In a day and age when plants are fewer and fewer to the bear
I will not allow these insects to stay at my door

I will not let them stop me before spraying them with batter

I want you now to know that we are with God
I will bring peace and blessings live
Im the true healer

If you have any doubts, pray, pray
So that you may know that we are ready to bring the end all
worry
We Christians literally stand here blank-shapes

And we depend on you
In the end, we are like this

We a Lady Jesus told the world that the least I can do is look like a cheapskate

I got a million dollars in my back pocket
Can't seem to walk the walk

So now I always gotta stick to the run

Cause some folks gotta get primed
Break uplate looking for a family
Or they gon find you a new life
Living in slush
Money, drugs, and guns make the cut
Living in limbo is worse than any long-term depression

So when you find out that we are real deal and that we giving we bad news
You know that being true means we are worthy of love

And more than just some some of the funniest people out there
I cant stand the thought of doing any touring
 Instead I would much rather spend my days engaging folks
In person or on the road

With the greatest songwriter in the history of the earth
I am destined to rain destruction on all of existence

I will bring
