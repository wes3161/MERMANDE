Pop psycho flood this neighborhood
I got a four-plead, one for my eye BLADE
So much ice I almost fell

Got a red beret snapped
Pullin up in that spaceship
Pullin up in that Benz
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise car
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that 911

Pullin up in that 911

Pullin up in that Rari T-Rex
Pullin up in that M40

All in my direction
Pullin up in that 911

Gunrunning 6 miles in a row
Pullin up in that M1
Got more guns than an Army base

Droppin bombs like an Army mommett

Trash talking my clique
I pop the M1 as an escort
So much shit I just legit need to be cleaned up
