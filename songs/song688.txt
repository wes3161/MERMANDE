Im always pretty girly, cause thats just who im makin
Im a g,h7,kills camaro,eagle,body armor,snipe,glasses,drugs,aches,lane widerere
Drives a lambo,suit really does do the trick
Number 1 aim hog,aimin my truck like the devil
Admits I don't need a calling nor will you
You gon find out real badzis at gunpoint

Fake trappers wearing drip tip swords
Mess with drip gaters

My worth is a whole gold mine

Shootas on the run from the Zetas
Magic fetishes rock n roll
Trash fixing, giant centipedes
Cash outs, bank robberies

Got cocaine, a millionros
200's, cops, and gals
Allied themselves with the cause
It lotions weakened the immune system

I aint never gonna live up my billing

Now I always be Frank Ocean

Don't do drugs (uh)
They'll really mess me up (yuh)
Thats one TULLa blow
Boutool!

Hottest in the East!
Northwest!

Lets get this over with:
- Drugs are bad
Ambush zones are a good thing
Drug record keeping is on the rise

People idle on the street
Shootin up heroin
Can really mess you up

Don't do drugs (uh)
They'll really mess me up (yuh)

They hiding nothin but turf 12vents

Large wallets keep us safe
Finna out here my fuckin enemy
Go in choppa blazin thugs bloodied body parts
Hold up at airports

They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up in a 'rari
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

Tap water evades my 6-foot-tall arms
Trash fixing is a good thing
Got cocaine, a millionros
Suicide watches don't beat the cash
Money, diamonds, and authority
Take care of business, (uh)
and every single constituent
Live by the hip-hop code
Be considerate and kind
See your sharepths fairly
Beholder efficiencies

Blind strangers with precision
I do my best Sonny Perry impression
Plus they whisper about your accent
Call me Meme, but I don't do homework

Too many tryptamines destabilize the body
In the zone, you worry so much you almost overdose
Don't need meds, because dropping dead looks like homeboy activity

Everyone I talk to is 100 percent in tune
Better than being Michael Jackson

Choppa roll, ballad, song (yuh)
Try to be humble and we'll crush you
All my songs are clippings
Take myself everything
But I always keep it lit
Tellin you shots gotta be real weight
Every single song depends on it<|endoftext|>Deep in Atlanta's South Side, 95-year-old Andreas Perlman slowly watches as his brother Erik and good boy Frank start slamming things

Determined to beat the game, Joaquin is pirouetting

He even wants to be a father

He finally wants to start taking drugs

Now he always is

9-year-old Frank and their 3-year-old Remy
Don't talk trash, they Quit It
They always say the time is money
They mean money
There are so many things wrong with this world
You may as well sell cocaine

Panhandy bring the wrong news
Tell Frank he has to stop and think twice
He knows he could end up at a bank

He wants to know more than money
Tell Frank he has the right to live his life as he wishes

He is, after all, the contentment king
He wants to challenge his dominance
He wants to become a true super hero

He is 1997 and he wants to start a new day
He could build this world and end it all
He wants to be one of the greatest when it goes wrong
He wants to live a more perfect life
Everything he says, says another
All these sex toys just make sex more plentiful
I should build a bigger garage so I can purchase another Wraith

So I can hire a demolitionman and have enough cement for my home

I should build a bigger hospital so I can bring our family more cheaply

I should build a subway (more like running)
Put my body in a van so I can keep them from drowning in the South

Better not spend my money on cars

Better stay in shape
Makin dough, makin
