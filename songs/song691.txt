Ring ring bout champ boutio in the shower

Fill my purse with cash
Put my wallet up for me at the airport

Got gangbanged like a 30
With 'em cut, clits and bars

Got 'em for trips all the way from the Caribbean

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to whip a 40

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat me like calamari

I cant think of any words that rhyme with cliche

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
There aint no one better than me
All these movies shades my brow
Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I am
Bust a passat's biro
Leaking the science fiction

 making us refugees

Mali with a filthy mouth
Harvestbought Cadmiums
Fascinated
Got my wrist in the rari

Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this blingbling talk trash?
Ca$h Floe and Jackass
Pullin up in that red Honda
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to whip a 40

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
