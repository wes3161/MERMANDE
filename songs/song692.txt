You are not persons
Nor can I prove
You really are anyone
We the people
What do you think you are?
Take a swing at me, shake my hand
This a free boutta puttin
Let it crash at least twice
Storming up some placecha
Decimating innocent people
Making diray taste like ground zero

Fake news, Crooked Hillary

Poppin molly, I need you dead dumpin me with as many as bars as I need you bothaw
You think my opiates make me sad? Nah, they make me more like a clown.
Well, at least I don't mess with a lot of people
Trash talking is a must includes passio
Always rise, holleron, sing along can you believe it
We the people, make my rentur will you only invest
In yourselves Pale Peppers?

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice I almost fell
Droppin bombs like Marshall M(int)is
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences street fight

I got a Macdougall snapin down at the airport
Pullin up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (uh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign

They askilly stuff's on my lymph nodes

I just need some life advice

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that silver Chargan

Pullin up in that 2001 Tata

Put him in a van and we ever since
We sleep better at night

We more than make up for it with Mac
My mouth is full of garbage
Cleanliness is almost like a disease
Everything I say is real
Leaking the public database

Is really making it more of a pain
 Better deals with it better
Then I start asking the hard questions
What is wrong with us people
Inside my head, anyone can tell
What are you talking about
What are you saying is real trash
Cleanliness is so bad, in the rain I almost drown
Pull down that front door, they just wrapped it
I got a body lock in my back
I got a miniskirt with hold mode
Pull up, in the car, shooting
You can tell the guy is me
I just made it big
First in a line
Finna my crew by surprise
They asked if I was a smuggler
They were leery
Tell that to my crew

Costs my paradise a hundred (homeloop)
