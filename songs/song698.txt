Go in like a jet and I'll stop you from doing drugs

They say radical criminology is less than
delighted that your asking for it

Everything I say is real

Try to think big
Throw money before your eyes
I want your money more than a dollar
Money53sent for you to experiment
I want to change the way you think
You can ask anywhere from a thousand to a hundred

Everyone who walks in my shoes must be obese

Are you serious?

Found a whole man cave under my home
Made it more difficult for terrorists to enter my home

Bass, pop, and country

I need to expose my accent to your
