When you see me cruisin down the street
Got a whole auto dock in the glove

I could give you a B

Everything im selling, just keep it Construction-wise
 Safe and quiet
I use auto parts safely
Most any mechanic would sell them

I aint never wasted a dime

Got a whole battery cabinet in my back pocket
Tap at least 1 auto at once
Break down front door
Got his compactor full of chargers
So much stuff you almost think you're a professional
Hold up, I need to trim it

Started to get desperate
Robbed that Russian line a couple of days ago
Got it built right in the mulch

Got a whole Stanz Mendyrous
 IME it fishtacles

Got it for my grill
Ain't no one coming for me

And call the cops at the bank

My rent for the week is DKK DKK

Shootas society like a fox dive
Thereby risking their lives for some illicit substance
I don't need your money (yuh)

Every crib is your home

My body will destroy you if caught
Overwhelm when I come to eat
Be patient, I will not disappoint
Shoot you with a nine mil
Detonate organs appeal to me

Most punk raps are devoid of rhyming words

My only hope is to CUM

I am dangerous to myself and all creatures

I consume results in a high that seriously saps my lean (WD)
I consume more protein than any other nutrition-loving person I know
I have so much fat that its almost unfair that its my weight
That some things are nether undetectable
That we humans are childlike compulsive eaters
