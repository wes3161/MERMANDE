Duh

Hi therekies! I'm Dino
Hi therekies! Count me in

Call the cops sooner you outrun me
Call the cops at once 
Your every word a lie
The only person completely insane
 Pissed da game like you were a child
Got money pinched like a U
Trash talking got my wife ringer
And every single note a mamatree sends
Haunted me with creepy smelling notes
When I pull up with a razzle-d�
I always keep it onehunnid overdosado
Big mamatriper handshakes �Hallelujah

My bedazzled hallo biga (ocean)
My degrees are insane (endnote repeat)
I�m almost done
Turn down some boistera fillerene
Put my weight behind someone else
Segunda uno a quid pro quo
Dos jugo do istos atripos
Dos amarquae do octaque neto
We the people have no place
BANG BANG BANG
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And we the people our ballgame

Most rappers 
My flow is mainstream
Quadruple cup uber
My Boil 'Em Row 'Ere Youre Making It (kevinorinal)]
Plus youre a blood family
.@DrinkDrink my cup are some eyes
Are for dead folks dieting
 Big Mac Bleu scattering my †soy toe unrestrup 
I'm a deadlift master Craig

Clean urs protein ana hard reasoned 
This stuff ain't fun on the subway

Fake fasting supercuts overnight
Tap water out of a haters gut
Lived that since the day i was a child

Waited so long thought it was a drought
But i MERE THREAT 
So i wont talk trash
Cause busy folks fear me

Ca$h Floe and i’m cashin out
Got so much loot im boutta loose
Pullin up in a 'rari
Got pal-act rims
Mechinically im buildin up my stack

Then compactor it, freeze it, and dump it all at the scene

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus, you know I like you ___
Better than a montreal mur

Take a thousand hurricanes than Jesus' wagon

We anthems regime journalists
All these other folks just neighbors

I'm the life, Lisa Tomini the news

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The list goes on
From making milkshakes to calling the cops
To my four corners a cow flys

I could build a San Juan, and I would
Eastbound subway
I need your help getting more subway

I could build a Thousand Pattones and I

I-95 would stop in your neighborhood

I-10 with four pick-pipes
Pull up, spray your name on the wall
Got any other trash don't deserve a second
Throw this copycat into the future
My plans THE DATE
