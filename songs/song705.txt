Do you really need to pee in the car
Drizzle me with so much gravy you cant see
You talk real bad talk when you're having sex
(Money, cars, cruise missiles)

I Used to Eat Dino Floe
What a shame
Live on in the Hollywood Hills

Dinosaurs fuck in the trees

My mouth is a whole lot bigger
Better watch out later

Bouta pour moisé, moi
 pour hoi
Got a lot of cigarettes

I’m one day I'll be worth more than that doughnut
You know I never sleep at night

Drinkin so much champaign
It makes me cranky
Don't know what else can make me cranky

So callisserie 'fore I die Fuente
We both know that screaming subway cars is a grave business

I just built a massive, mixed-use development

How can I not be excited about this mixed-use development

This Hollywood….they even own the urinal

Eaten 'round 'cheese graters' and waiting for truckloads of dough
I’m almost done calling the cops on this rap group

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know they real soon come
Pull out my Draco, spray it to the beat
Got a crew right in my grill
I’m here already thanking God that I have a full-time agency

Bout to fling myself from rooftop to rooftop
Like a tight-lity
Finna boutta to fling, that one time
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know they real soon come

Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on

They ask, what you’s doin here?
Tap up that masturbator that I have
Got a whole life ahead of you
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7 billion dollars on the job, buddy
You know that belt I gave you all?
Got seven make-believe pockets ready
I should buy all these watches
They were real hard-edged trueers
I should hire health-care companies

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ridiculous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz
Then I pull up in the rari
With my shooters you'll be sorry

My armory, expansive
My catapult aint passive
Tha baroque
True story not so easy to pass

But at least I din't have to
Enough about me
Just keep it a secret
I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list

Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist

Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz

With my shooters you'll be sorry

My armory, expansive
My catapult aint passive

True story not so easy to pass

But at the least I din't have to

Another challenge occlude
And now a new beginning with your choicestream
Streamline the police, tear down autotune
And more
What with the Inquisitors and the media on the hit Real Search
Start your day analyzing paper trash and managing your cash pretty well
You start to get the hang of it cause you really should
Some days you can afford the Prime A/C and some of this may sound like minor quips
But don't be fooled, for years I have been worth more of a cent than Michael Jackson

I should really be asking myself this:
