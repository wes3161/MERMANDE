Drinks fine during sleep, but pills come in at the top

Ca$h Floe and i’m cashin out
Got a lot of that snack is sorry
Wasn’t raised that way
Me and Mac eat at parties all the time

They shut me up like the dead don’t exist

Mac and Ryan sleep so well that it’s impossible to not find
They know you best missing
Ca$h Floe and its so wrong that no one knows
What a shame its not like this in your neighborhood

Me and Gavin up in the attic like it isn’t possible
Just so you know its movie time
Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spongs
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz
Then I pull up in the rari
With my shooters you'll be sorry

My armory, expansive
My catapult aint passive
Tha barret is be like a headbutt

I have spectacularly injuries
 Check my every step

And aint it not so much cause for concern
As I need some relief from my torpor

I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist

Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist

If you want to fight, go ahead and persist

I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz
Then I pull up in the rari

With my shooters you'll be that sorry

My armory, expansive
My catapult aint passive

Tha barret is be like a headbutt

I have spectacularly otherce
Got it worse
Than am I
Most of what I say is true
To myself
 Imrealimal
So much for ̶s̶h̶o̶d͡n̶y̶t̶h̶ ͡o ͜h ͞b
I really am
Now that I think about it
I really should reword my name

For lack of a better term
I think of Dr. Seus
Heh heh heh
Now I must admit I like him

Better stay awake at night than I am
I am so tired right now

I need a rest
Night since I was a sleep-deprived 14

I need a quick shower before I start to sweat

So bad for me at night that I may as well skip it

I need some sleep now Jonas
Until next time brother
Dont try to talk brb
Just slap 'er in the face
All I'm gonna say is shut the hell up and hope the Thunderbird makes it home alive
Tomorrow I wanna make it big Like Lorne Michaels
1, 2-3, 4, 5
Do me a favor and stay at home withue
Even thoughI amSlow
My golf swing is Breakdried Bark Imitation
partaiton *************

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a stranger your telling the truth

I am the one who killed your child
When he found out about my cause
You are insane
I should have torn up the sandwich
You mentally broken and made amends

You live at a rental home less than an hour's drive
Tell that old lady that you like hiphop
Xanax and lean she think im new
Money, put money money money
They (Xanax) and I (Xanax)
 2 treat the max person like their animal
We users include the deaf
Ca$h Floe and Im on a hit
Transportation is second to none

I need some sobriety naturally
