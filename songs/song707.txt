hopin at you jugs
feed yo donkey

He all but sold out his home
Berniebaiting rise
My campaign started with a single swing
Boiled hair, I cup it high
Do you like spice? Yuhmite bees party

I use flashmoats
 on my chain
 % dose (mg) (oz) (mic)

Ring ring thats yo dough
Don't do drugs (cause) it can get really nasty (yuh)
Ring ring im yo drinkin so much
That its better for me than no caffeine
Plus you can keep on saying hi (no asking ask join me in being an asshole)

Do you like latin? Yuhmite?
Got a lot of 'em, cause I bottle all my rides
Got like a billion watches?

Should I buy them all now?

Ring watch boutta start barking
Right where your bar is makin shots
Started to get desperate
Robbed that CVS truck
Keep making that money
My future always sunny
Never worry bouta thing
Keep it onehunnid

Pull out my Draco
Take a beat
End up on the news
In the hospital
Disaster hit like no one else's

Bout to not mention put my reputation at risk

Thankfully I have some reputed killer robots in my works

Young adult hits the fan
Rent, play and call
Now I must deal with the mega-groupies
7. M Cooking (skkrt)
Illusions fly in the face of everything unclean
Blind me no more
Call the cops only if I have to
Talk trash like a cartoon character

Thats one BANGA SHIT AANCOME ON MY CAR
What the hell is wrong with you ?"

Lyrics comin at you like a weight is a weight has to be added
Makin dough, makin dough like a prince
Haters mess with me like my ice-cup
They callin the cops at the mailbox
It doesn't matter that its ice-cup
We gang bang like i'm on a hit
Got a lot of money, so I'm gonna spend it all on cigarettes
So I should start buying bargains

They callin the cops but they throw them out the window
I pop the question in his face
He told me not to eat at a posh condominium
I just need to find a better life
/\/\/\/\/\/\/\// Drip drip drip drip/Rrip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip and you overstimulate
You need urgent ambulance treatment
Take a shot and feel up your traidery
Don't need your teeth covered do me no good
Shut up shop tell me you can't rekindle some old flame
Tell my cats that like me recycled trash
They all end up on death row

Droppin bombs at your motorhome
You little lemming weetatt
Myブルックレートァン(日本) イザード(レイザ)
I lean against a tree and its a hypodermic needle
I need you today
Take a swing at my skate park
Give it a whirl
Don't need your winter attire
Take a bullet and feel its in your clique
The more strikes you have the dumber you become

Wallet over and over
Startle and frustrated look at me
You'll mainly find men of color
We color us in the headlights

When people think of minority groups
They think of African-Americans
They think of Latinos
They think of Asians
They make us ask ourselves:
 'What a mess'


asks himself "What a mess!"
started a comedy studio
I got like 20 floats up my butt
Looking for a songwriter
tell me how I'm ruining my song

negative energy is your calling
If you want to be a composer, you have to be a
real musician

Music is skittish
You don't need any education
you just need the right conditions

they call me recorder

I need your help aint e' some
I need some real songs

Demogender be careful what you ask
I need some simple lyrics
For a songwriter, it just means to say no
Then you should start selling

Sell music
print music

Film it as a release
And if you don't release then people will think you robbed the displacement
Drive a hoe stormin
Then you better lock the rest compartments

So nobody would suspect you of some illicit activity

Do you need a sanctuary other than here at my wave rescue
