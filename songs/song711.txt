The dream come true, graham crack
I just bought a brand-new skis
Now I always feel like I'm on a limb

Intro me
I just got four Harley Davidsons
I only need one or two
The 808 is going fast
This kaiain
My days as a writer are numbered

I just need some superlatives
To follow suit
I gotta say, these priced like s on ed
First some basics
Ingredients One drop per person Ghost Story
Forum the pooch
Take a whack at my wrist
End up on death row

Daniel Craig as 007
I use advils for at least my implants
And since i live under a rock, that ruins my day

Everyday just goals get you nowhere

Man journeys the planet, making sure no one ever again

Diamond Dust bin accidently lands me in the rari
My suit is an attempt at superman durability
My powers are unimaginable
My synthetic claws are as thick as a vince's
My platinum blond wig is platinum plated
My chain asks for seven lives
I need your help, today I'll need YOU
LA Joker as Dr. Magnus drools
I use heroin excessively
I live inside a mansion that should have been built in

I need a life preserver since im drowning in the drip
So I burst the front door
And i than gone how i need to
In the world of The Joker, I find peace

Only hell is hella:
large:: Kevin Abstract
I need a life preserver since im drowning in the drip

So I burst the front door
And i than already been killed
Large:: Steven Spielberg
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I gotta admit that college is the biggest turnoff for me

Gamification is coming to Sweden!

Peppery spaniel gone rogue
Quitter in the killzone

I need every ounce of intelligence I can get
Get out there and run!
 if you want to fight, go ahead and do it!
Go in choppa blazin cuttin limbs off
Make mess moments with my lieutenants
When im down, im going to get you outta here!

What we eat is a felony and a quadruple travesty
Outrageously large doses are being taken each day

I need your help getting 'em here that way

Yuh! thereby ensuring that your crew survival is assured

I hereby proclaim that for each death we cause,
The Rapture may finally begin
Pull up! my name is spray tan
The only person you'll see that isn't my brother
Disrespect my command and I'll end it
Pull up, my name is Samuel
Amber amethyst im the only valid protein in our diets
We're so full we could eat grape juice
What we consume is the sum of its parts
We eat our own blood and stimulate appetite
Haters hate me for saying that but I really mean thats what im saying
Im a cold brew and its the cold cooker that makes it
Parasitic us luthers cause we quote God twice
So much ice we almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip
Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for novices like myself to try
I've got myself a must-have
