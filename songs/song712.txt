If a homeless person wants to stay at home with his kids and he thinks it would be a good idea to put them in a vacant lot, that would be a really, really bad idea. They should rent an apartment so that when they need to move in, they can get some rest too.

There is nothing worse than an attack dog, a watermelon

cake I start with an diamond, transform it into an ukulele
Add the (expletive) steel wiring and you have my pulsating drum \r
You know best that I bring stability to a chaotic situation

I chew on innards like lard and I swear I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean

What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?

Take a beat and kill em with a slingshot
Money ain't a thing
Now I need your body and my mind
Everything I say is real
Help me cause the drowning

Don't need your miracles
They could put me to sleep

Choppa complain bout I live in error

Put 'em on my wrist and molly them

Don't need your mamatronics
delight me when they crash your block

Large cash floe cause a fire in your home
Oohhhh my throat is full

 Trance leaking out of my ears
