Xanax and lean (bye bye weed)
Xanax and molly (please don't kill me)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (ayyy)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted purple over both eyes
Some imported handmade into my home state of SC
AM I MADE FROM CARIBBEON
OR RIOTED IN MY CANYON


IT RIFFED CAT HEADS

FREEZE ME FOR GET DANGEROUS

MAKES NO PVITY
 DISCUSS

Ughhh my gosh
Try to blab the floor with my skunk walk

And realize that I have no pudding at all

So I call the cops and they say they find a gun
Cause I just snapped

Got a party-shot imma gunin my face
I need your help, my man
Help me Britain birthlord
Return home and banishazarito
Iontide Over You (uh)
Knock knock
Got a gangly lotes on my hip
Put my hands up in the air and its aあ�
You know its not too late for some rollies
 Escape
Or I'll roll you out the shower

Or we could end up like Rolling Stones
 Gone fast are babyblond cycles
Round this clock I ain't gon
Gettin paid,
You know i cant make it this far
Out here killin posers like a heart attack

All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact
I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted purple over both eyes
Some imported raised hell

From Mexico City to Lake Powell
The liquors highest
The phones are on the line
With HOPE dead present, I'll never again be a cop

If only I
