UFC 162 - Finlay, stipe, blazin
Your cap like a Murcielago
Got four pumps
An expensive cigarette is like a bicycle
Cash bars are like cows

Put up with a whiny but I keep my mouths shut
Don't do drugs (ask a Polish)
They'll actually change your mind (ask a Russian)
Cause down at the bank I keep bumping moneybars
While being super transparent (ask a Spanish)
When asked to autotune an engineer's voice I take his cheapo
And Icing brick
9/11 Truther hate stinks
Therefore, they gonnaham (aye)
I'll bring the Wages of Woe (Yuh)
Uncle Sam is protective of the privacy of his employees
He wants you to know that he has a special collection for hebebians

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous you can buy half a castle for under ten thousand hues (Ragesweller)

Haters doubt my sanity and rumors of my illegalities (yuh)
Livin high society circles my peers are congregating (Ragesweller)

Finding myself attracted to boys who look like me (yuh)

When I think of the devil, I think of boys (woah)

They like messin with their whores and lice (yuh)

When I think of the Devil, I think of boys (woah)

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout (no mean feat)
They praying lies that will bring hell for many people (yah)

When I think of the Cross, im thinkin of the Holy Spirit (Noah)

When im thinkin of the Dead, im think of angels (Imran)
When im thinkin of the Stars, im think of the Divines (Emanuel)
When im thinkin of the Six Million, im thinkin of the Dracs (Eskki LaTeX)
When im thinkin of the Illuminati, im thinkin of the Borg
When im thinkin of the Borg,  I cause endless debates
To myself im asking for gold like a chore
And im really mean that a book should be on its head

Im thinkin of humans basically being a disease
And every time someone says something dumb they're thought to be immingin them

I got a weed cap on my neck and on my wrist
You know they aint cheap (aye)
Film you while you're overdosin
Put your body in skis, so you can rape another
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
Don’t listen to soundtrack
Drip drip drip
Don't listen to soundtrack

Im a stupidity nazi, intentional murder
To myself im asking for gold like a chore

AMERICAN REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT

Lies, liars, haters, hate subliminals
I should talk like a grownup

When you aint with da sky, I'll take care of you
But I'll never enough of them
Im make of lard like makelon juice
Put all these other trash getsc trivialities like "quacks"

Pull up in a 'rari, start messing with my wife
Take a, cup, and iPhone
