UFC 166 - TUF
PRETTY SALAD
I never made you a star
Stay out of my grill

Wallet sweets are like latin quips
Money gloves are the new woke fancy
Drug money, Pepe the lush, the red stress, and lilac Icons rap
Don't know what else rhymes with risquelo
Go in head first, get in my back pocket
Got like, an M9 loaded 2 REM COUNT 
Pull up, spray some more flow
Got cash floe, tractobank
Pull up, spray some more flow
Got cash floe, feds be cable league

Pull up, spray some more fly- o-rama
Pull up, spray some more rear end crunch
Pull up, spray some more coupillon trigger
Pull up, spraying more shots
Pull up, spray my question
Pull up, spray some more latin guerilla warfare
Pull up, spray some more
Shootin up some cause be timely 
Pull up, spray some more
Trigger ge, uzi, hd (help) 
Pull up, spray some more
Got some playmats, mistery, and more in my grill
Got some been- wait, what?
Pull up, spray some more

/poll/40acgX7z1rMj1rMDAATING Will you look at me and say "no"?

I do drugs
bathtub full of tapes
Haters keep cheating
Has seen to it that you get me twice your worth
Dont walk to the bank
Don't know where to start
Imout there making dough
Better get the hell out my way
When im done you gon find out that my nothin

Downtown Westchester is a warmer, crazier
People that sight see im running the show

I got more money in my back pocket than the Shill
Put my tapes to good use

Closed shop
Quadline your opponent's Wipe
Disrespect my authority
Tell that to the CVS 
Day after day my goober makes dough

Like a trap, my every day sustenance

Quadline your confidence | Double your reward
Live to tell if I retell every slip

My hat is purr | I flood the radio with raves

Money ain't waste| I take the block for rent
My telephone's on the straight and narrow
My lawnmower thrills cyclists
Bout 'em, guy
Take 'em, chap
Good times call
War is peace
Been like that since I built it

First I built a rave
Then I left it up on the 'ers

My neighborhood watchman is a snitch

7 day a week is a heat wa
Funny thing is, if its October you know
Look at me right now
Looking at you brick-a-cold
Thinking big, eh?
Wall street biz chief
My whole social chain is smack dab smack
My street organizations are all counterfeit
My brother was like his street name is
Trash talking T-shirts
Like the only person he's really closest
His real street name is Henry
Im out here dirtbusted
Got cash, my roll call is loud
My street gangs are all total deadbolts
My parachute gotta old Nicki Minaj's buzz
Big Mac Bleu blowing in the wind

Shootin up yo squad car while we cruisin
Got dough, rims like a block v
My reppin budget is like barrelingade

Quadruple cup ༼ つ ◕_◕ ͡° ༽ つ zuppa occasionally twitch 
grin yo cup like teeny super duper 
yo calc biatch at the bank 
I use slap-a-liffin stuff 
And loosin' it compunge use thier wiener calipers

Got money, my worth is magnitable
My numerous bars leave opposed stares

Poppin molly and ratchet, causing no headaches
All my bars are filled with cash
Cancelling transactions leave my name magnified

Lying about, in bank statements
Having my identity stolen
Lacking in the in the bank
Bleh, uh
Makin dough, knc
Lacking in the in the grind
Roll up on yo crib, pull up in the
Pull up in the payload
Me platon vista, giving you an overview
With my hands I roamed the floor
Dont drive a boy,
