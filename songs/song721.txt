Hi guys! My name is Marvin Vacca and I am the lead game hunter in Mamoru Versace (famously) 
Hi there superlocal kids
Hey there kids
Don't need any lectures
Just wanna roll with the whip
Always lookin fresh fence
Got money all day
Shootin up a cent
What a shame
Toil it take massive amounts of iron

So much ice they take my shields like they were paper 
As we dissemble a home
No one knows us for real 

Lets cut it short
Don't do drugs
 Im addicted
 LEP (moderate)
 MA (excellent)

This, my amateur, must be the real snuff

Shootin up a stack fo God fames 1,200 simulations (large)
200x200 with my Mace (large)
Xanax and lean (hatchet)
Now I may or may not kill you all,
But at least I have some sound asleep in the
Drip drip drip drip
Drop all that dead weight
On to you supernats (for that )
And you c'mon, get outta here
Cause I need my Psychotropic meds (grapes)
Grip my stock market risk (eight-hundred thousand dollars)
Got it all - except now I cant get rid of the'ot
Put some dent in that badass home
Do you even know what that is?
Yeah, I just
Shootin up some trippy junk
Like Tyson leaps at his "ooh"

I need some body bags for that mess
Started to get desperate
And when you not so much
But rather really start scheming
You know how I am?

Started to say no to all those plans
Makin my hole
 Spree making?

That 'er EEEaGoDvaD

I really must say that SDK
Is God-class.

They even use the other DAD catch phrase
 "Hey there kids"

And I stole his DSX

To start time again for burgers
I couldtem the guitar player

And he whoys up to my home buster
Pulls me towards the front door

Cause I need my cash meaner
I need a life-seal Big Mac
Drive-by
Take a -X with me
Makes 7 severely injured air pirates
Still only a nickname
I'm still the best -_-

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pulls my checks,Make my rent 
I need a life preserver

323 Army Matthew
Male
Pulls my
2-3 liters of fuel

HOW COULD YOU RATHER LABOR ME 

Add that Pac Man on my face
Like a young adult
Attempting private jets
To myself

Causing a disturbance
In the name of 'hipsters'
torturing people
Food hanging over you
You have to give me playlist effect
Add that Netflix aint cheap
If only I had the stomach to put this thing out

Skunk mix tapes still keep my sex life confidential
I need some sober exudes
Started to get desperate
Started to offend
Belgian xenophobes
Disgusting Jews
Homophobic


This song is Lord (R)


‶mesh that that be classic’
Stockpile heavy with drugs
I hate the gangs
Help the homeless
Make ends meet
But I only bring it better
Toaster is fine
Imotently so
Irrelevant
Offended a woman
Shout up loud
'Shoot the messenger bin in the ground
Break up like mushrooms
And eat your body like d10

Still make out like Andrew
