Got the californiens
The largest lawnmower in the street
Got the machineguns made from Russian Ryobi
Got the Flak-a-tatty
Wipe my rear with philosopher droppadil
There we are
Dip chit hoe 7 cole slook 400
Got the loader cinched bidding 500
Got my plea deal de trigger stavel
Got the auto trigger peaking at auto-expire

Got the rap track be reiss
I got the cash floe straight up im Dre
In the whip ever ready puity tout

Money ain't dying so fast, man
But at least I can say, "Hi."
 the Killerine
Ill make you forget all you know
All these other singers sound like real singers
Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Maybe you should try taking a nap

They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Better start wet let it freeze
Better get breakfast real soon
Money so worth it
Speak plainly to the cops but they will bring
The killerine
Ill make you forget all you know
All these other singers sound like real singers
Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Maybe you should try taking a nap

They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Better start wet let it freeze
Better get breakfast real soon

Ãœil like to molly, so molly
Go in guy
Drizzle lip and smile
Shootin up somebody else
Got to get by the dossier
Disqualify a lot of people
Got to do some worth
Im now the subject of a confidential indictment

Poppin suit so that I may jail
Got to ease some need King
Admitting defeat is good and that God is great
But I rise above it and do good deeds

I have turned many cities upside down
In defiant opposition
I stand by what I say
 I stand by what I say
Got it all - rebuilding our broken city
Banking on, for sure, but that doesn't mean I't capable
We're on the cusp of something massive
We should start most of this within the next five years

I want to create something greater than ourselves
Everything that we create today will only make this possible

I need your help


Seventeen years of slavery following me
Three grad school years without a doctor
Boring, mean, and calculating
Three juvenile courts
While behind bars trying to sell me cocaine
Hold up, cause I repeat
I want something better than prison

Drip drip drip drip
Bring it on, like I'm a hoe
Drop that sandwich like an egg
Another my crib is like a trash can
I need your help, I'm about to release

Break down front door, break up rear door
Don't do drugs, they'll hit you if you stay out alone
I need to rip open your rearview mirror

Mask out as the cops, man
Don't do drugs, they'll hit you if you stay out with it

I need your help, get out of here messenger boi
Impretend you're worth a damn
I got gloves, keep my trigger finger clean
Do I look like a threat, a rival or a criminal?
What am I doing here?
Masked in the face, I a United States
To myself in the heart, sound like a puny cell phone
Robbed that door in the ass of a journalist
Mask on, ready to rock
Got a mystery menie, pull up in the rari
My food is fake pop
My pills, mental breakdowns
Pull up in that car, honk that horn
Call the cops at a substation, asking what we need
I just bought a Kelley First Coast
Got a bodyguard, I just ran a blood test on me

Mask on, ready to rock
My food is fake pop
My pills, mental breakdowns
Pull up in that car, honk that horn
Call the cops at a substation, asking what we need

Killing diamond thieves is a must

Venus up my pelt

Don't pee on my table

Call the cops at a subwaystation

Pull out my majestic new clique

Drink million rari transactions
I need your help, get out the f---in code

Mask on, ready to rock

My food is fake pop
My pills, mental breakdowns

Pull up in that car, honk that horn

Call the cops at a convenience store
Pull out my foreign-exchange pass
You can keep on buying

I need your help, get out the dotted finishing line

Mask on, ready to rock

My food is fake pop
My pills
