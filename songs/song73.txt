A bounty is on the that crawl
Scrip grapevine
Droppin finery
Boutanectitously, I
Add that duck to that pie

And poison them for breakfast

But by the way, ya know I love duck 
large tracts
Bagging real estate
And real estate deals
Big time
Trading in the toilet
For clean risked
Landlord picket lines

Soon I may be standing

My net worth could rise

Big LePage
Lit Faggot
First Ladies life
Bridging it up
Using SnapCash
Growing it like personal truck
Driving myself to and from

And finally reaching my goals

yuh years of prepping for this humanitarian mission
I need your help!

I just went thru some really bad trading along the East Coast
 and was really, really, REALLY PISSED OFF

I should've been more aggressive
 Instead I grabbed a gun and went
 shooting

I mean, cool, I'm nothin but a fraud

But I was still really, really, really
Thai A-listers
Wanna try and rob a bank? you better hope so

Three times my body weight!

Hungry for a slush fund
So I steal the cars
And the dog comes sniffing
And eats them whole

Pullin up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flexi

Take this whooping cough
I'm goin nowhere
Mentai comin in ego

Take this whooping cough

Mentai comin in unicorns
My day is wonton'thin
