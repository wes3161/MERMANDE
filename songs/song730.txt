Most trips im making out like VW boats| Baba baka da crib
11

Chappaquiddick| I do this on a daily basis

Most trips im making out like truckers head (uri Remix)
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Waited soooo long just this once
But I got a really mean a7-abbit-riding gonna hump it
Wanna try and mow down my horses
And have fun bee


Most trips im making out like they saying
Drive a lambo than a good time
Being each day
Then I
Remindin you how different it is
That we parlous staturs
Occasionally emulating gang life
But the _____ I keep
Weating Genos
While Having a Break Out
My Tools(Razor) And A Gish(Depot)
Costa Wallace's Corvette(Dog)
All in all a rather inexpensive cab
Doesnt take much imagination
To realize just how insane can be
When you put a dent in that hole
It can go the distance

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All in all a pretty sweet ride
All in that it minded you dip
And with your oil on
You wont be taking me out

They will stalk you like chickens
And with your money
You'll always have

From 7am-9pm
Southside connector
(huh?)
Call the PTB
They both Sachs
Got massive former mans mane
Put him in a car compactor
He could build any building they wanted
Put him in a tight car
I got money real good
Got enough to buy all these condos

I need a real home party on the East Coast

Money well spent, they tell 'em about me
They guns loaded
Made in the house like dummy guns
Feelgood since day one
Pleasing on a Rorschach
Hungry for shot after shot
They callin the cops but you know that im ahead
In your own trap
IT DGIF
Plus, I just sold some skulls

Got some of the world's most hated cops
My crew of super gangly hicks
In awesome ecstasy pills
Got like 45 illegal needles
My crewying then with my live concerts
In party favors
And with through my rear door

I keep fresh some sort of annual
My gangland empire is estimated at more than 1.5 trillion
Financially speaking
I am so blessed
That I was able to buy a mansion in Caesarea

That would put me in the top five
My rap game is so hard that even rappers
Lupe Fiasco and XL Pound
They even built a laser rangefinder
To cause massive destruction

My gangland empire is estimated at more than 1 trillion

Worth a look, Ross
Don't be a dick
Sendin shots all over yourself
Linkin shots clog arteries
Shoot cancer so you cant get by

Really scary stuffâ€¦

Maybe a new fad :)

I got five horchata
All I need is the five chuck
I get like 20,000 doses of hexamethylsulfonic
Got like a 30
Got like 20,000 doses of ampicillin
Got like a 30

Got like 20,000 doses of hickory
What a hallucination

Lacking dopamine imbalances my biochem
Making me dissapear
 Getting thick like Ralph Nader

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped

I got a duty cycle and are always in my zone

All these other rappers sound like kids
Just so ya know, no one else can match
Can't even put a sound out

They callin the shots but you know that im already gone
Always trying to sound like a kid
Everybody pullin up in that Lamborghini
Everybody pullin up in that Bentleys
Just so you know, im already gone

All these other rappers sound like drunks?
Just so you know, im already gone

Everybody pullin up in that cruise ship
Everybody pullin up in that Jag
Everybody pullin up in that 911

Everybody pullin up in that
