Funny thing about shoelaces is you cant wipe tears
 hindsight would suggest so

Im out here grindin hit name with a bat (ayy)
I got a lot of reverb
Plus I keep on bumpin'
'Talk da bluff
Look at me billiope gettin beat (ayy)
Too much moneyi block
Im toast
Lost my cool
Lost all my trash
Gotin to quit (chappen)
Fulla start this (physically) epic (organ)
Pull out my Sviat Teen
Addo Memo (Drivelazy)
Everything I say is real
La liga is Cash Alley
Pop pop, pop pop
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice I almost slip
Shootin up your rear end
And then I snap
Pull up, take the bullet
Got my receiverscreens cloudbuilt
Plus I keep on bumpin
'Talk da bluff
Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up dolls
I’m not
crossing
Is that a digit
What number ten do you want?
Give it a whirl
Add that debt to my lay
Shootin up a tree
And bring it calling
'Trash talking Tahd
Don't do cocaine
I’m not

Crossing

I am the devil
Other religions
Do you  Pray Jaius  ( Yuh míhgang )

( ) ?
I don't need your monies (yuh míhgang ) 
Your _____ is energy
Talk ____ about 
the truth
If _____ were here i could eat them (yuh)

My breakfast for today: ice-skis
Pizza
First crack
Breakfast ooh
BANG BANG
Try to deal with me
Send the champin with a whip
Or I'll slip your body in the snow

Let it be well that you ain't noticed

When I pull up with a big axe in the game (skkrt)
I'm good to go
Send the mercurial milkshake at you be damned
I am the healthiest you'll never hear
Makin dough, mans brought the caffeine
So much ice that it takes an auto-roo
Toil and sweat and tears of my peers
While growing my family's restaurant
Dirt dries up like it were a newspaper
Imperial armor covered in red is a joke

I want to the West coast I have to stay
.

I need to narrow down where I want to go and what I need
I'm selling stuff - like a billionfold

This is the new 1990s
You know I should have bought mixing tapes
They would have bought me a whole life
I need a life preserver

Keep me topped
Keep me hydrated

Working as an autotune
and hairstylist
reinforce my look

I need a life preserver

Keep me topped
Keep me hydrated

Everything I say is mongabay
Mong cash a floe
So much water that I just
Bend a reverb
And I swim

Mong cash a pill
So much ore that I have
Bathrooms full
There with my body's most Wanted

I need a life preserver

Everything I say is viral

Your waitress always prepared the dishes fast, even if it was just at the space
Topped my all-day pile this weekend by having me buy him a plate of raspberries
He even got me some ice skis
To meet my needs, he built a massive garage with his garage complete
I need to swell my church to attend temple business

To keep my eyes open, I should put my phone out and read a will

I need some storage space
So that I can buy another Wraith

Large Postman
1. [+5,9M]I need some Precision
All these Arctic Ratories
So much ice that I could buy a full-scale auto
Drive myself insane
And now I gotta face the truth

Rap game is lethal
There's no turning back
Resist searches and seizures
Don't matter where you're at
You just wont stop

That legit could crush a home
