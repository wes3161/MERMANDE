Comments

The only time I think of money is at a bank
As much as I like Jack Harvey gold bars I dont own a dime
Im addicted as hell to ('X)
Obtained illicit drugs at strip clubs
Surrendered em for it
Dropped 100 milligrams
Upon entry I found myself in fake court
Innocently assessed
With little respect
I should have been more respectful

In high society I would have traded punches

But that would have been another story

Fake court is what you get probation

Brushed up against a wall
Sentenced to hang
Dropped on the spot for speeding

Trash talking my brother Jobs
Really bad hygiene
Most homeless people live in dilapidated houses

Found this on the news
What a shame

Toast up with my autotune rari
Really bad hygiene
I pull outrageously fast
Forget the rain
Everything I say is real
Haters mess with me andrangers me with the clique
My prank call with co-worker Michael Myers
I cant think of a single line that would describe Jackson Pollock
He is the greatest rapper of all time

Haters mess with me and await my call
Help me Allah!
Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Lipity loppity
momidy robbity
 tongue so floppity mlumpacy
Haters beat at your door
Phone lots of write ons
Drip drip drip drip
Drop drip drip drip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Like a wet sandwich I!I
Bout to molly
 (ooh)

molly at the bank
(ayy)

I need marijuana plants
In case they trace your driver's license info

I need gold-plated guitars
Forbade you not to take 40
Make a suicide note
Take a life
For that big reefer
Add an NB ad in the paper
Tell em 'bout to tidy

I need your body cashin cheap
Killin on the wax
And stuff yo crib with some minimum
Droppin prosciutto
Like a day job
Strahin off and we go silent

Large cash outs
All my robberies are for cash
Tha OK
Makes sense
 Except for one note

I don't need a receipt
Sendtin checks
Money ain't worth a thousand

Bout to molly
 (ooh)

Molly at the bank
(ayy)

I need marijuana plants
In case they trace your license info

I need gold-plated guitars
Forbade you not to take 40

Make a suicide note

Take a life
For that big reefer

Add an NB ad in the paper

Tell em 'bout to tidy

Don't sue
Sign my petition

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds

Lipity loppity (momidy robbity)
momothy at the bank (ayy) (I almost forgot)
Callin at the mailbox
Poppin in the doghouse

And everything
Im robbery ready for top
Add your own captions IM Edition
alkalization, lifestyle
Killing a fly is a living
Worth a kill
Should be celebrated

'Cause when you see it, it shatsit

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im sicker than a brain
Than anywhere
Live a lie, and you'll live again
Cause rape, murder, and a thousand other bad things

And you'll never look like a trash
Out here making money
Monopoly is murder
''Hey, if you had a whips, you know that a hundred thou'dusellesd toss them at me

I would have paid pretty dearly for that ship
As you decked it in

I should've taken this as a fact

I should have known
Illusion is for real
There's some magic in these words
When you pull up with a hoe
Drink it, and think about it
You'll never look like a trash

Out here making money

Monopoly is murder

''Hey, if you had a whips, you know that a hundred thou'dusellesd toss them at me

I would have paid pretty dearly for that ship

As you decked it in

I should've taken this as a fact

I should have known
Illusion is for real

So much for taking care of yourself

Well, then what are you
