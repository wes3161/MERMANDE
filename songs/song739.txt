Put your body in a car compactor, taking out the trash like John Huston
You know you aint supposed to stick to the party
All this 'dab stuff' being real
It must've been made in Mexico

It is thought that this Chinese toilet is real

They say Grimm is real
Ca$h Floe and I
Catch them all up on the street
 Knocking on your door are youan that 'ylo"?

Makin dough, makin dough a galax
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard it almost fell

Im been drippin in the face since day one
All these other rappers sound like total swindlers
They really are the cutest things

They even got me asking that straight at the bank

Xanax

Im hungrier than a dog
More likely than not a gonorrhea
Mouth ached so much that I almost died
When I vomit I impair judgement
Lacking the necessary concentration I can't walk
Thrash drips up like gasoline
All these other things just make me sadder
