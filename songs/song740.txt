Making dough again

With my millimeter a blip
Called the cops at the gas station
Was this a joke?
They aint funny, they aint you
Complainin about would-be burglar
Got more guns than a ham
All these rappers wasted cycles on cocaine

I do drugs, they love dramatics

I do crossover, they bandsies
Mess with the czar, we aliens
We in the house justice

Pullin up in a 'rari
We in the living room

Cash boxers hang in the sky
My wallet has already been stripped
Screw you, miles away
Out here causing havoc
In the glove
Perked enough that I needed an adult
Put some games to that boy
He rang my doorbell and said find my trunk
He was right at my door

Yo ​I am noise comin at you like a weapon

I want your money at a gunpoint
That way when I log in,
You know I live the dream

Put my trash behind me like a FORM
 Like Ja Rule Your Life Guarantee my Cash

Take my wrist as my a***

Quadruple!!!!!!!!!
BANG BANG BANG!!!!!
