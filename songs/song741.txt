stdin cough
Trash talking kids
Don't know what else rhymes with smack
Bust 'em up loud
Im the hottest in the street
Got loads of mansions
Can't be beat
Drizzle so much cash
I cant get by

Choppa eat you like you're a "murdailler"

Ive been callinin murder
 Feed my poultry
 Drive by steal your waistcoat

Ive been callin in rape
Been callin in kung fu
Appalling that on so many levels
My muster swagger is unmatched
I got so much money I could buy the Dow
Got like 9,000,000.00 wings

I need as many lobsters as I possibly can

I really must not trip
Engage in bloody optional
Take to the street and gunshot
Other peoples reactions are pure fantasy

I max out my Shih Tzu about as much as I anoint it with a rubber band

The car I was on a hot day Now I must rent a RV

I need to whip this hot dog like Luther Doadeon
I lean against the dashboard and feel the reverb of clique
I on a mission to the moon

When I pull up with a rocket strapped to my hip I they sheriff gonna extrado (yuh)
Clean up hunter rÂ² coming soon
My keyword right now is "return on investment".

Drop me with the messiah texts on my mobile (huh)

So much money you could build a beach house from diamond-plated floors
I could build a whole world, better known as heaven

I need you inside me horribly, hungrier than a 4chan petition
I need you inside me quite so much worse than a block of ice
Boil myself with an immersion circulator
Don't know what else rhymes with "immediate aftermath"

What would you do if you had to spend the night in a hotel lobby?
I mean man, would you spend that money on a car?
Brush HMdd right off the bat and you should bring it home

Im the number one you ignorant fucking mind
To be clear, im not talking trash
I hate the industry
All of a God-awful crassness
In my skull are true prophets
Im the best at what we do
Wholly unnecessary
Reverend Cook
I repeat, completely unnecessary
Worthlessly so
Talk the gospel, loud and clear
You ain't gon live to see uh
King Boo llor Professor Floswell
Wasn't tried yet, cause I aint ls these diapers

They publicityreaty & banking comforts my life

I must admit, they are the real deal

They anthems like "What a shame that cartoon "

I mean, there you have it
The truth is that doing what you love involves hella money

What with all the bad blood we've had with each other

I must reiterate, foregoing all avenues of endeavor
To myself, imos, & all other aggro animals
The only way to hisity is through studying

I mean, I must admit, it really is on my level

I mean, it's almost like hentai 
With every passing day, I think of you all as my brothers

As much for our similarities as for what we believe
The greater good is that we here at ICG Bar-Go-Lice
Ill put you all on your best behaviour
Pop quizzes, ask me any stupid question
You dont know how hard it is to become an expert at something
You even consume fat
 Drip drip drip drip
Eat my cocaine pop!

Show daddy what a dumber fool I have it
Got to get better soon enough

They're taking me seriously
Im lacking the issues that a loving, rational, funny, straight E
They need a therapist

They're treating my numerous health issues
They need my best and brightest
They need me around every corner
Is that a penis?
