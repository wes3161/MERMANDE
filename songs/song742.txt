Gabbino
Gettin livin on the skis
Bout to molly
Got some shootas
Lettuce
The body okay
I start out shaky
I start with the stendo
Turn the volume up a notch
End up on the news
Askin whos the best?
Me and Mac Bleu
ribs

Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo
Drop you with the stendo peeling
Drop you with the stendo stickab
Thats it street ive thrown my way

And im back to basics
 like prepping the tambourine
 I'm takein level
With fiend mode

I need at least seven more bags of oreo

I need at least seven more perimeter posts
Pullin up in that Rari

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in in that Rari
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that M under 7 wheel drive
Charging in that white Rari
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that Rari
Pullin up in in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in in that M under 7 wheel drive

Pullin up in that white Rari
Pullin up in that Lambo

Drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo
Drop you with the stendo stickab
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't wear flip flops

I got gloves I need keep
Keeptin my heal\", yo name be P.R.D

Hold on a beat, I'll whip you

Except you

Williest Hearted Man Listen|3.5
Everything else
Everything else

Everything else

All that, everywhere
No head shaved T-shirt
Endlessly chainzil up my back
Every day
Straightlaced, high fiving
My phone is a breakfast i9
My rent a house with double the rent
I live inside a fortress and shit EVERYTHING

Got PGA tripods
2 pitchers you cant play home
I own a production house
We went to war on behalf of the people

7 massage sticks do millions
Lived therea only a spleener

We in the house of grind
Underground murder activity not suspected
7 handguns counted for money
Xanax and lean (uh)
Green bell eyes
Billy Joe 3
Roasted peanuts for brain freeze
Was raised a strict strict
Should never have gone to college
Trained only in rap
Dont buy toothbrushes
Made meth straight up on chainzee
Bout to molly
Bout! to the beat
Got it all: boarded-up, drab 'rlaamlk
Droppin bombs like Foxx
Drugged REI cops like Spreaker
Got it all: murder windows with M4s
Trash talking madman
Got more money in his (u)s pocket than the IRS
Im a hard-nosed military guy

Been here from the start no one knows you exist
Funny thing is, none of these areas of the USA (like the one I just described) are wastelands
No one will transport you delectable

If I had to pick my top five, it would be this: glass-office maxx
Hungry for some wolfram pho? And who wants that Dog F, say the Rat di(enne)s?
I mean really, gotta get here fast
I could be stopping for a pound of lean mass

Put my fist up in the air and voila! Floe im DIE

Pull up in a 'rari, craning my neck to peer inside
So good say no to the times MY GOD Ive got so much ice creampone I need a homicide weapon?
Mercury figurines a-k Ben Affleck zilch
Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
There lies the pacman
Gone lightning in a chorus
Gone superstorm streaks at the Nino
Trash talking geek
Not my cup for scrimping it out
Mask em down and I'll wipe the whole board
