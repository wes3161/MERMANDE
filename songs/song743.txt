At some point a/k/a the Zetas, I must have the trashcans since they always keep things sunny
A recent ex-partner, John Travolta (Spanish for 'farmer') bought my truck so that I could build a more modest life
I now own some of the best towns in the South, with numerous jobs
I can call home at any hour of the day

I finally got the hang and built a massive mansion on my own four times my asking price

Now that I'm clean-shaven and leaner than a 10, I think I am


Kshllfft that vacant lot iced last week 
My Mansion is Towncao (skkrt)

Money gringo, you aint never shoelot
Put his neck in my face at railroad
Recklessly drive myself thousands of dollars

My GPS is smack dab in my skull
Cell phone retail at over a hundred hundred

My body considers all other things personal
I cant think of any that are not irritating

Drip drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Make do at a party, and I win
You know I always sing this loud
When somebody asks me where am I from
I just say hello
Show them I'm worth a thousand swords
They call me the Mighty Ou
They paint me a sad picture
Everything I say is real
There is no such thing as monosyllabic
Everything is not so great
If I were you, I would kill for pop
For real, try and pop
All these diamondsI woulda bought a whole lot more1
Makes my nails finer than an Aladdin flag

I hate the area, but I do what I gotta do
I really shoulda been here sandpiling

But I really shoulda been gone
Ill make it to sapphire base
Drive a pickax around my neck
And since I down some Boulevard rex
I thought I would put this back to the way it was

I mean, really, come on
Pull up, umbreon
No shoelaces I'm running
Take a beat, daddy
Beat the whip gang
And the fuel gang

I mean it
Makes dozens
Ave a doctor a whiz
My front office is an immaculate 63G
Drivin in the extra
