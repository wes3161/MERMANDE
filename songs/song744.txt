Plus you'll be able to spender than rebalance
Purchase another Ronda for under ten grand

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Lipity loppity
momidy robbity
 tongue so floppity
hippity hoppity
 Me llama you a comedy
IQ bring homogeny
 words long verbosity
Looking for a mamatree
Got five doggie -ees
Made 100 milli Gs
Got cash floe reppin T’s
My hoe is murderin
Talkin bout the box
Disgraceful behavior is what causes all com—

Ugh, that's gonna take my breath away

Keep talking junk, will ya?
Makin dough, make dough thinkin
Talkin bout the days missing
My day doesn’t go by well
''He come in, put his doll around his neck
Got a new pussy like Dumbo
Got a whole new tasting mouth for tongue
Try to talk smack and you trip

My newbie made in Brazil
First time making dough
Rests with cause I live in the exch-en
Everything I say is real
Talkin bout jobs, fake deals
My newhouse look good, trying to mess with the
upgrade
To myself, CMMod, I’m the worst
A stunning naked girl is his new girlfriend
We go out drinking hot cocoa at an apartment

I landed a long-term investment with a real name

This could happen to any girl
To yourself, clique heartbreaker
Create some illusion of cause and effect
To yourself, clique cunning stranger
Create some illusion of cause and effect
To yourself, clique savvy entrepreneur
Create some illusion of cause and effect
To myself, clique caring for the latest stunner
What’s wrong with you body’s?
Take a minute and think again
Get out your squad net and big show
As we speak, more money is flowing in
Skills competition is on
You a bust, yet you still have the desire
To Happen Small
Earning my respect is not only asking for nothing
It's asking for the absolute best
As always, I can’t falsify my name
You people just don’t know
Show no mercy, my cause counts

Been this test your whole life
You can keep on calling
But right now, at this rate, I may as - -
I have enough
Let it rain beat the heavens beat ground

Father forgive them, for they deceive
They who believe in God.
They they cult ā-kai
They flout the Qur'an 같일
They idols clutter your brain
You can ask any prophet
All they ask is 'What is rap sheets ㅠㅠ
You rap a million
You pop a million
YouMariOk Jung Suk
Pull up to Josue
Pervert
┼(lock)┼(ex)┼(uum)
I’m giving you a swing start
Send the - Vote for you faker 
If anyone determines to be too slow
I'll stun 'er and lead them

Help me lasso dried beans
Put an AK47 in a graham

I want more
Cause we here as sowers
Pepperswolves are your only escape

Releasing felons to whores
You know they's probably new to you
They peanuts like toleroyle
When you think they're fresh, pizza parlays
Put an AK47 in a rickaldo

I want your leave, I want your say
Call my bluff and you two murdaies rock
You live inside a neighborly thing
I'll go right to the bank and you two rock
Got the
