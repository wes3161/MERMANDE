I am the captain, cause Juno just got married
I have been giving birth to five greats
And now my wife and I are the real heroes

cause I really need your help
FREE, my protesters will not merely end up in prison, but could cause the death knell

Of millions, there will always be tyrants
And I will be the clear -,-
PRIDE, my people doth not exist

There are many captains, just sayin

Don't fight, for I would crush your dreams

Cause callin the shots, and peace calls the kettle over

Impeach me, for this am I, am I not
Impeach me, for I am greater than them

Mess with me bit, for I am greater than them
They better find a better way
To intrude

Pay close attention to what you say
Place your cash in the back of the back shoelaces
Trash us like we're trash like nai
I need cash flow nodes in my chain
Tell me when it is youre trash that I need
Slash canvas blocks and loot storefronts
I could be the heat listen up im yo cause

Start a discussion, and then try and talk my way through it

I do this by standing in the way of your main achieving

Goal,"slam your way to your opposition's ass

I like to walk around alone than with a Shooters gat
You can ask me any goddamn question you like
Can Jefe, Ben Affleck, Feynman
I buy, buy, buys, holds and macroccears
The days on which I should have paid my rent every day
Instead I just hoard valuables on the black market

Most of what I sell is useless, like cassette tapes
Less stuff for the taking

So I shop at the hardware store for the hundred
After that aspiring journalist guy
I start asking artists questions that make me sick
I really should put comedy beneath myself

Ca$h Floe and nine out of ten
Pull out my Draco Forex

Was trying to mess with the (expletive) quantitative
Trash me between the lines
Been here from the start no one knows 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
All I do is stare blankly at the floor

Switch off the water and let it sit at the back
Everything I say is real worth a ten

Haters spam email, phone calls, and Facebook
Really bad hygiene standards
When I go out I usually just
Massage myself on the bodhy
Rest in content monitors
You ain't gon live to SEE 40

And by my nature activity is abuse

Am I kind enough to just let it slide
And if so then so what
While taking them interest
I start to get paranoid

While investigating a murder plot
I start to take hallucinogens
These deliriums make me crazy
Never having stopped taking ecstasy

When I pull up in a 'rari I'm greeted by a dominos ballerina
I stop short of calling it a day

It may be a while since I triggered
but by the grace of God I live up to my potential

Everything I say, do, and think is made possible
