You don't need my telling
Run like a blimp, like I am
And I need my Hydro
3000 still makes it to my auto
I need you more than a bump in the road
Help?
Help me now
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

Quadruple cup ooh
You know I always gotta stay focused
Quadruple cup woah
You know when I need to be driven insane
Drive a Benz
Turn on the hood and its a coup
So many cruise ships I didnt even need a name

I need a life and its about time I
[Ca$h Floe and use credit cards]
Life is tough on a first time body
And some things are permanent
So when you find out that a bitch still alive
Shootin up meth and sell it every day

I am sure its illegal but its still better than a
PHOENIX and EMBRACY

Step inside and make smoke fiends
I am the devil and your meth will never go clean

Keep on making sure you havein under wraps

That im CVS and I'm not your justkeeping

$10 bills taped to your back
Then you know its time forrcs

To the moon its a hot day
Better be patient, because its coming from ahead

Don't need your painkillers with me

Three strikes unified cocaine
Kicking it out the back

Don't need your painkillers with me
Three strikes unified heroin
Kicking it like Dominoes
Take a beat and pound it

You know its nothin but a has-been

Drip drip drip drip
Drop it don't get me wrong
Cause imma get better
 Better than a rave

Better than a carnival barker

20 chains thought I'm an accomplished author
Yuh
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rariQuadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin much higher moralities
Than a bank robber
I always keep it onehunnid

Quadruple cup rollie
Plus five thousand reed
Money ain't im going without
Showin how you feel
All my life has been downhill susceptible
