Adds an alertist on the order
Add this extra verb trying to find your landing

Out here make dough, get 'er hella doughy
When I pull up with a drag truck in the garage
Go see what you made of
Makin dough, knead it, let it rip
All this dough getin cells in your brain
Looking for a molly so its strapped
Plump strawberries are getting my pay
