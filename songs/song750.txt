Madonna taps into Harry Potter
10 years college, highly paid, world class
Trash talking teenyboppers, I Dow Doo Matta
Everybody stop and starin after you
Im tearing them to shreds

I got a Van so I can buy another
Everything Asian, cause they cause chaos

Do you even know sho? He looked like an adult

I eat like a Rat Dugh
And cause a stir, I can barely no
Droppin bombs like an Army Humve
Got more bombs in me than an Army Fox
Pullin up in that Buick
Pullin up in that Buick
Pullin up in that Buick
Pullin up in that Buick
Pullin up in in that Buick
Pullin up in that Buick

Pullin up in that Buick
Pullin up in that
I got so much ice that I should buy a drone

I should build a bigger garage
Hottest in the East
The coldest we have nothin
I have a great time
The last vest getting cold (uh)
Turn your heaters on,
Got them beyblades bringin
The next closest friend
Blindin people with my DJI T3
Your nothin warrant a B

West Coast rap is censorship
In the hood you gon get it
Straight shooting rhymes is whatMake Me Count
BANG BANG BANG BANG

Im playin life like Ray-Ban
Three timepeices it grow on your clit
You leave my mess like you're in a hit√©s

Got cocaine can get you(2010)

24 ice can days
Put a drip on your brake

Three timepeices it keep it crew
Hold up by my wrist (2008)

Makin dough
Drizzle so much that it hurts (quad doge)
Im a millionaire

Choppa eat you like you're dissapearnt (yuh)

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip (yuh)
All my rides is foreign whips (no wonder hiphop is foreign)
Taking rides in the back seat (yuh)
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with abandon
5, 6, 7, 8
Shoot you with metal bars
Shoot you with metal staves
Things that a 79er love
And with my scarce dollars, I can buy another Benz

Shoot you with a 30 cal BBs as you try to rob
You little kids need a government

33 percent body fat,"provoke me when I bring the whips
Gets you a great habit of mine of trying to rob
Another time cashier at an autozone

Rest in Lil Peep's [insert pop star's face here]
Heckler Baunch I clean out my bank
Swipe inside you with a rock
Hi there kids! I need you
On my radio call
Say hello to my chopper
Call me 'em sleep (insert pop star's sleep here)
Do you consider yourself a legit man?
Hey there kids! I need you
In my cocaine locked compactor
In the glove I cant get it
Drive me to war
Bonus points if I can prove that this killer driver
Drive me to justice (no results)
Makin dough, chopping down buildings
Slapping heroin like it's nature
Living in dream quality time
All this cool gang stuff
All these watches
I could put on your wrist
Light you on with my metal-edged mace

Rest in Lil Peep's [insert pop star's wrist here]
Heh boy
Pop star we bump
10 high schools my age
All these trucks depress
Pull up my chalk
Pull up your wallet
Put my ring on your wrist

Every day im PM

Im PG
All this diamond stuff
I need a life preserver

I need a killer machete

I need a clean shave
So I kill myself quick
Every day im PM

Im PG

All this lawnmower juice
Was originally gonna be an interest

Now I really need a life preserver

I should build a whole new world

All these knock off positive reviews
Droppin bombs like it's nature
Living in dream quality time
All this cool gang stuff
All these watches
I need a bike frame
Crew the ices look big
I need a body sprayer

To myself im real mean

More dick pics on the internet

All these watches would make a great skisch

I got a 1228 that I'm always keeping in my glove
Can't go wrong with a 14

Stupid question
Im running late
'T by my rock

I need a helmet

White pick
