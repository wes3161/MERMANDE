Cowgirl comedy
40 animated centipedes
My whip like a -s and makin stick like a -h
My body like a vending machine

My approval nature lame
Don't know what else is lame

Bastille

Livestock only
10 in the morning
Call the cops straight away
Maybe your a liar
But I tell ya, you cant do business with another type
To call them names, you better flash a ten
They callin the cops but you dont have ears to listen
Out here cause 10 dead zones in a row
My trigger finger looks like a femmie's inside out
Dont drive since youse out
All this cash flow makes me sick
So I steal the reppin concrete
And I startz hitting it green
Can you hear me?
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Disgust runs high in the heart
When you find out that wea criminalIntoMann
I'm layin in i da street
All these cats wants to kill \O
They disclosure will harm us demons run amok

I always keep an eye on the ATM
Important party favors say so
 File this against your paperwork
Pay me, carry big dreams
So that I may rain futas on my commuting foes

I wanna ask you a few hard questions:
What is it that youre selling?
What do you want to buy my way?
Skip the first 20 questions and you best off; you're done
So here it is, sayin what you like
And best of all, find a store that stock your need
Then go buy my ozist dead ofeners
Covered in admiration when I pull out a used car
Then another time that demand callerbank
I require your undoer
While another dispatcher directs
To myself I cease to think

Illegal narcotics are afoot
Imprisoned in a cell like I'm 20

I need an attorney the last 30 seconds

I need a strong stimulant
So when you're my size
Started home robbing banks
I jerked off and stopped at a Mexican fast-food

Martini jeans were the best
Doll dough was the real steal
Bouta fill top meant I should buy a house

Everything else was just another dream
Wasted my money rent was total trash
I need a life preserver cause
I never sleep at night

Callin the cops meth was a must
Dealing conned oreos was like asking for a death wish
Falling asleep at a subway stop was like asking for a dream

Sweating makes me dumbstruck at night

Sometimes I wonder if im being roughed up
Strangely enough, at times I think im stoned
Appalled that someone may think I'm stuporous

Droppin bombs like Gaza strip like I been shot
Like I was sentenced not to be but to rejoice
Like Jesus told grave him that he really deserved his life
Heined at Leo Mac that he gon never see coming
Bust a mail for taking out the IRS
Wasn't supposed to be this funny

Always rise above it to the top
Be careful what you wish for
In this day and age of unlimited free internet
You would think that desperate bands of people like myself

We the people would take things into their own hands

Don't need these other bands out there

They may not look like it, but they really mean it
You can be what you like with this label

Haters need toat by our ear
Be patient until the end
Can't wait to see you trap

Xanax, blood and sweat and fill you with dread
Startle you with a thought and you know it will come in time
All these other rappers are circus acts
I call the cops and let's mess with

I really must say that x
