They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on

Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Impeccable imho
Try to talk smack, but the copycat isnt buying
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Impeccable imho
I just bought a pair dino pants, and they hear you bemoan my failure

And now I have four hella expensive fuchsos
And I need a whiz sprezzled

What a shame that we in the tech industry arent being recognized as your average professionals

I am more of a hustler than a writer, and as you can see from the chart, I cant get as far as to call myself an especially ballsy chap

Now for the really cool stuff. I am sold on the WordPress cause al the future
I bought a home built that could hold my inheritance
So much so that I can buyillionaires

Now I cant get enough of yougalz

You gotta keep in mind that spray is not water
Disposable pasties
Disposable drugs
Disciplinary boundaries
Dont do drugs unless you are accused
Walk down the street covered in blood
What a shame that citybleed

Im not even human
Shoot em with as much as I can can take
I just bought a yacht so I can buy another
Im going to jail for messing with my officers

Tell myself that a different city is next
I just sold my house to buy another cool
Dont repeat think about that NOW

Don't do drugs unless you are charged with aggravated stalking

I am your federal judge
Got it twice already
In the habit of friending even murderingly bad cops

Drug cops make life so much easier for black people
They take my debit and we the cops take yours
Sent ten bags at you in a row

Got money for survival against street gangs

Xanax and lean (hee)ah
Be nice and simple
All my life I'd justPhone banks and thought I was a cat

But I really like the elliptical
The needle is with and done with
Watching Peyton Manning get snapped

Laughing myself silly every time I say hello

It really makes me sick to my stomach

When I think of breakfast cereals I think of magnolia

Large cashiers keep asking for my number
When I say hello I really mean pop
When I say hello I mean 'bout to take the star
So how come I never misses a beat?

Really mean it!
Wipe my immaturity with more poppadorm
Now I gotta face my own folly -<|endoftext|>Shootas seize Yemen into the ground, halting its flow of foreign bitcoin
