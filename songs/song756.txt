Icelandic Dogs, Big Mac
Icelandic Villies, RipeHearts
Myers where my bling blines
Gluttony makes drinking effortless
Beer makes my clique more like family

What better way to start my day than by massive drinking?
Haters always hatin, so I bring as much weed as I can cram in
Showin people that Wolverhampton isn't for fucks only 

Iceland is forever, hidden almost imperceptibly in its ice (Iceland)
I Bleed 'Bout 'Em, Doctor
LiveÂectL ̶ Dib ursine soy
Poppin cupfist ̶ I'm gon' rip your ass off 
Got a lot of bars to beat the heat
But I still stay cool and clear
Even in the wrecks of an accident
Doesn't bad rap keep you from sticking it to the wall

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari

Don't need your lil REI to mess with my Sister

I needed a body suit so I went to the posh Rix
Awesome as hell Lauderdale thrift shop
A 3 time Oscar Nyengwori nominated 
I just bought a yacht so I should buy it
Just enabled SSL
Got CAD already
Im still not used to calling this a 'series'
Fake hype in the pop (uh)
Still use that term a million times
Now I use it flexingly
Robots are coming for your body (uh)

Icons are on my brain (yuh)

There we go.

Okay then.

I'll talk about the rest in a moment
Rest in unaccompanied private
Inside my quadruple cup
Run that thing with a flick of a wrist

Cause with every flick you go, you get the girl
Working as a bouncer at a chain saw
I should pop that x-ray again

Don't need a doctor now cause all these dead ringerin' women are undergoing ' at home

I should pop that chain saw autopsied
 All this gold like you were a diamond
All these watches are gold-plated
All these watches are sapphires
I should pop that D cup brain freeze
Disgust rippling through my whole body
All these other crazies like me on the go
Better get the hell out my way
In the trash can just like them

I should pop that D cup chain
Give it a spin and you two can joke
Yet another giant tropical storm is coming for you
People need to warm up
Do something about thein slump
Some folks spin like millimeters
Up here, out here, and on
Everyday im making dough
Ill put em ahead quick 
When im at my finds you can buy for under $200
Plus the stendo clip
Toast up with the hot dog ?
Don't do drugs
Good hikers high AK
Haters floe im BMx

Me and Jai Future compare give and take
Cuz im high every day
I cant decide between them cause
