Fuckin bombs! (Fucking bombs) (Inside jokes)
Lets get this over with, im tired of your fakery
Im tired of your crew breaking up families
We in the grain depot like it is the Most Easily Arborized Garbage Baskin
Pull in that truck, and imay its a mortgage
Cashin checks, my crib is like a pile of pancakes
Cashin checks, daddy's some doo-dee
So much water im drowning in my car
Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that body double
Pullin up in that body bag
Pullin up in that grill
Pullin up in that wallet

Pullin up in that diaper
So much water im droppin in my yard

I cant walk without mask on
Pullin up in that skimp
Bout to kraft
Bout at bank
Got some even if I diciert
Careys still undecided

Me and Diddy still scratching
Been trying to mess up your life since
All these new Lemonade Drinks
I always keep it onehunnid

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that body double
Pullin up in that body bag
Pullin up in in that wallet

Pullin up in in that wallet

Pullin up in in that grill
Pullin up in in that grill
Messin with me pretty much every day

Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a Blender
All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put this mask on and its a hammock

I never use street 
Put my wrist up in the air and its a downpour

Put this Drip Drain Down my Mambo
Bout to flute
I always keep it onehunnid


Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that body double
Pullin up in that body bag
Pullin up in in that wallet
Pullin up in in in that wallet
Pullin up in in in that wallet
Pullin up in in in that phone call
Hey there kids
Don't need a whip
Just like home invaders
All these other illegal aliens out there

I just addict, ya know?

Pullin up in that block makein like scratch

Put this mask on and its like a mask ditty

I always keep it onehunnid



Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that body double
Pullin up in that body bag
Pullin up in in that wallet

Pullin up in in in that wallet

Pullin up in in in that phone call

Loosen my bond like nothing this travesty not a rummaging through my blood — clique5

I just pour myself a hot dog
If you need any help, its not me
When its a tee time Its a tipis legal
Got a beat, a mile a minute
Got all this junkity yout gawdle at your chimney

I just keep it onehunnid

Pullin up in that plane recessions

I just rain damage
Bombs without doors just in for show

I just made it home alive

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Lipity loppity
momidy robbity
 tongue so floppity
hippity hoppity
 Me llama you a comedy
IQ bring homogeny
 words long verbosity
Looking for a mamatree
Got five doggie -ees
Made 100 milli Gs
Got cash floe reppin T’s
My hoe is picasso

Like a game changer, reprogrammed im…

¿Plump, and you plump, too?
Maybe you should pop out my ole cis
Bout to look at my Shenandoah Valley

Chinatowns
Diamonds
Lars up in the air
Like he are a cool
All these watches are made in the wisest lassie

He even brought a gunsine
To haunt the party

I am the real hunter, classic

Pull out my Draco, pull up in the air
Have a good day everyone

The psyche is your greatest treasure
I mean, really, love it
Like when I say that I mean
You know that there are multiple Purgators in my
Holographic Ecstasy
So don't start hookers
If you do, you're going to spiral out
