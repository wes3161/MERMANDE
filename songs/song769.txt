Pack that up loud ready for action
Take a beat, like a champ
But I don't care who you gon game with
What you need my Uzi is vaper code
What you need my Sig

Hold on a beat, but you dont wanna hear me breakdown

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari, nobody comes by
Take a beat, but you dont wanna hear me break
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)

Pull up in a 'rari, nobody comes by

Make it rain real quick, sugar be my hauler

Don't need your draco rainbows
Droppin bombs like surfer darlin
Drop dead delicious
IN THE LOOP

Got guns black only in a hiphop bar
Brush that shadow on the street

Don't need your mylar compartments

My spiders just damage the value chain

All these other rappers just copies of me

I aint never play hide and drip, please
All these stores make HARD DRINKS
You better lift a stick FIRST
I am so loud my listens will be raves around town

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Waiting for my guy at the bank
He asks me how I get the last 15 bucks
I start asking guy, you know im the real hunter

He says interesting things to say these things ain'tEverybody-

Fake rappers that need training and better themselves
Haters deadpanned around town saying how pretty they looked
I stopped them all with the stun pistol
The jungles were kind of devoid of animals

Funny thing is that only a fool would try to do something so silly

I just went through the motions and been recognized

It was pretty impressive when I posted
'n' shoot
Whoa, thatz soda
Run the spade up your rear hole
And I coulda sold like bucks
Got it ready for you
go get that Tommy
body stamp em


good times at ID-zone

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Lets get this over with, the drugs fucked
I got the drive know look like I need a favor
Call the iced latte
All I need is a favor and I'll do ok
 Body paint all over my demeanor
My shift is empty really bad
All these avoidances are calling me
Me and Jackson Jug
Drug involved at a drug deal
Was called the other day
Was busted for marijuana possession
Got a lot of bars pulled
My make-believe mother is dead

Got cash floe reppin copies
Living in the dark
Disrespectful of the cops
Got hookers staaf
 Drip drip drip drip
Drop dead promising never again
Been here from the start

Checkin at the bank but I call
They straight up tell me not to mess with my stack
Out here killin people cause what you put back in your body
Like crack cocaine

Drip drip drip drip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu on holiday
Wipe my neck with side tracked play
And told the truth
Even though I do it my way favor a reppin tout
Wipe my lean neck with party-hut
Got money so far in my late teens
I doubt suicide bombers are on the way

Ye hot mess older than me
The only person that can beat me am kiddo

I got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Juil ownersll

I got so little I should buy myself a bigger dharma

Haters dead like election cycles
I got so much gold I should buy another Rothschild

Livin high society
 Maintain it oneblahblah

I just got to high gear
The autopilot is finally working
The other kids in the car
Keep banging on the horn
You know I need this career change
Started my own business
 Big Mac Bleu on holiday
Wipe my neck with side tracked play
And told the truth
Even though I do it my way favor a reppin tout
Wipe my lean neck with party-hut
Got money so far in my late teens
I shadow said other people better beware
I need this career change
