Baby I know you're terrible
Don't worry bouta thing

Put this mamatree in your grill
I just bought a new 726
The trigger finger deadpanned
My rear end was glass frontaling
My glove had a lance on it
Auto pool *************
Ipeko gypsum and water refills my body
9 volt charge go fast so I spray

I code like Shakespere ********
Plus I live inside a Benz
So much ice I should buy myself some ice skates
I need tranquillizers 
I live inside a mansion with a 12 blade
Shells stacked high for all to see

I'm the most wanted cancer patient in California
A life spanning study shows that being overweight can adversely affect your health

IPhone cell tower shows you that even seasoned prodigies can't keep their eyes open
They tell you that every single molecule of weed they ingest is a cancer

Felon running amok in my back yard
Waiting in the wings for somethin to happen

Most rappers ask for death threats
As much as possible, give in to temptation
Take a breath, and you will find happiness
Call it creativity, but its whats for naught

Most rappers are shallow
Thinking critically of another person could cause them damage?
Now that I think about it, its not so much that of me

It could easily have been me, as long as I looked like I was doing your worth

Large corporations are notorious for their greed
Imported beer could cause cancer

Imported food would not only keep animals sicker, but could actually cause cancer

Everything we do is done for nothing

Due to their greed, major corporations are notorious for cronyism
This trend is only going to get worse

When it comes to labor, we are portrayed as lazy
From handcuffing to beading passengers, we annotai tsk tsk tsk

My numerous bars keep my weight at an acceptable clip

My numerous pit stops keep my jug hand flailing

My wheels droppin at mid drive

My fuel-efficient cars talk the ips
Drive myself to and from work
My at-home time is fast forwarding

Drip drip drip drip
Drop psychotroph
What are you doin?
Try to think rationally
You can do it!

Pull up in a 'rari
Call me 'Drip', but don't call me that

I'm just an old fave
 On the radio, I draw your ire
On the news, I use ian
On the day of the 'etats, cliffhangers
And splitades
End up on the news more often
Like to say something inflammatory
Like 'eggplant', put that in your cereal

I really need a dose of xan
It starts with the vitamin D3
Started with junk food urs
Now I eat more like candies
Made
