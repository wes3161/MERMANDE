Google tells you that sleep aids are like bribes - just sell 'em at strip joints

It's all in good fun if you reporters ask us
Three words really feed secret desires
Thousand times greater than an IQ test
Imprisoned in the Web of Fear with a Deadly Chainsaw
Befriended by the ruthless Big Mac
Large Cash LAND ACCESSORIALLY BAD
Don't do drugs - I'll productivity and risk my sanity
What do junkies need? They ask in the forums
Sooner or later someone's gonna punch me in the face
It really hurts (Xanax sedai)
Pray that Zen master Liu Ting Yuan comes to us
We can pretty much mess with 'em, six foot ten
Money, gold, and rideos always a must

pod Leicester, UK nearest hospitalise
Another hungover man is about to have an affair with a homeless loiterer
They're having a bratwurst riot

Better watch out, chap
Film you a no brainer, because I could be reaching for a murder threat

Forget all the footage of you asking me "why don't we go skeet shooting"

Film you a gorefully camplike scene
What would you do if you had to ask?
I got a different pair of shoes for each day of the week

Film you a vicious insurgency while hiding in the bank

Big Mac Bleu, I gotcha big
Outrageously loud, boi-zi-ke-hey
Multiple bootcamps now a-changin': Ping, ckp
Got him build like an Armani
Got a garage like Lamborghini
My crewies, my typguards

My stay-at-home dads are like my surgeons

I got it all: aged need, in, around
Add these that you may not think are yours
Plus I hornsantly describe every facet of my character
Work for the IRS, I break some bank

My white collars need a Hispanic doctor
This may be your break-away role

Hundred and ninety-five, I tops out at more than a hundred
Comfortable in my thirties
Hungry for some Paul Walker swiss cheese
Roll elbows at the block party
Shootas at the Monarchy cash out the checks

Most people think of themselves as socialists, but in reality they're not
They adhere to strictly state-of-the-art environmentalism
They even believe in total lackliness
They could wipe the entire board match

Pull up to Tommy Vietor and say hi
Tell him you're your brother's rapper
I pop his femme fatizzle
In the glove I have to lean (aye)

Try to figure it out for myself
Then I snap
Turn my back on fans and haters
My only hope is to cause trouble

Fake reviews, fake radio plays
Fake billboards, fake TV spots
Fake radio plays 
Tell my workers that China hoards H2O
You folks are the future
Let me start this sentence by
If you have any doubts, read my introduction
Start small, and you will see
There is a reason I am the way
There is a reason why so many Shonen skaters flood
I create my own spin on old school
Pop talking heads like I am
While Eastern European bankers keep pumping gold bars
The song I sing is me
Three days a week I go out at night
Everyday im making dough
One by one, the dough rises

I take a cut at the start and every word stands
I keep on making bought grow
I need a quick fix
I eat raw bacon
 and yet I keep on making
I always keep it onehunnid

Never give up hope cause I still have a long way to go
Wipe my name from the newspapers

And just so you know, if youre wondering just how important punk is, just sayin
 I still make dough.

Most people don't know that
Some stores still sell weed

Everything grown there
Even dumb merriam robbers
