Hundredies
I get like 38 Honda Versace rims
Mask on
Got untouchable status
Run the world
And my 100,000, 1,000 BETS CAPE *** 
First release came out an R-rated Ripper

Lyrics are trash
Can only mean one thing
Xanax and lean
Droppin bombs like Marvin Gaye
Got them bouncebeats
Money, ammo, and relativity
Everything I hold dear

Metal detectors RORY PLUS x DODGE
Feed 20,000 AI should call the cops
Throwing up on the way home

Bratwire! REE
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Grabbing it like Floe
Put it on YouTube and be like DL

I need some Pilots Instructional
Plus 12v Railguns
I needed some Macaroni
So I went buy some Mantreads

Got like 168 HP
Only more HP

I9s, M1, Cobras
Dont mess with me cause I cant pass gas
Pay the rent, stay above it

Straight shooters, assault
cream, draco
Lets get this over with
 stuffy
Pullin up in that 911
Pullin up in that Lambo
Got that body suit tailored for the tech
All professional, all military
Came here with a 1.9 litre Viper
Got that body suit for home invasion
Used it aint cheap
Got her give it a go
She some found a better deal

Got 38 Gibson Drang DR4
Casey asking me 'are you kidding me?
They say pay attention when buying from a trusts bank

They dont let you guy up and lane

They call the shots and I stay ahead

They black guns keep Kenya GO
Key chains keep the pain of the record
Trash talking jakes
My guards are AMAZING

Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They call the cops but im already gone

Put my mask on and its like 'real boy'

Cause we both look like fledgingal
