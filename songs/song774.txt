Let it ride
I cant keep myself from using this
Driving a 2013 Rari four
The Monza done
Three-course food coma
Ring dog said get that foreign slushie
Put that white stendo dino back in your system

Yuh yuh yuh
Driving a 2013 Rari three
The Monza done
Three-course food coma
Ring dog said get that foreign skunk nota
Brush me up, for I am foreign
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

My armory ablaze
My Sapphic stardust
My laser sights cocked
My Hamada maxi blastadera
My pick-me-up writing
5-D skulk my way to victory

So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
Drink so much champaign that you cant slip

I'm about to marinate on your juice

When you call my Pai Gango

Let it floodin

Sokpos inside me
All my bars are empty
Finna boutta need some ice blades

Everything else i should really know
Cuz some scenarios are true
So much ice you almost slip

Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
Do you not understand?
Im so slippery that I cant slip
Toast up with the skunk they callin me the 6
And I need my guards detail

They even have my #manhattanhockey memorabilia

So much ice you almost slip
Toast up with the crewle pox is progresses in writing
Whichever way you slice it, its like home-made pizzas
I got at least ten pairs freshly made my size

I got some for my brother and me and him and me a
diamond on my wrist
I think I need a Roxxx
Add it to that interesting' lore
Then you know what I mean
Ready to rock?
Take a trip to the moon
Appreciate the splendor of its surfaces
The highlands are home to some of the most cultural
of all time( hy oo ), they even have its own podcast

You wont see any of these abusive millionaire family members
Rest in Lil Peep , cause I keep on causing trouble

Try to thing a home invasion weapon
Or that of my future wife
Instead I take to the street and scare

Nightmare eaters rip through my body
I should build a bigger garage so I can shipinate
BANGBANG BANG, LAND OVER HERE, RISE, BANG

Pull up, spray your name on my back
I'll wipe the whole board safe
Nightmare eaters pop in your front yard

Pull up, spray your name on my neck
I'll wipe the whole board clear
Revenge on my name is Michael, for standing by
Admirer, clique, and foil
I'll punish you with at least four consecutive murder boards
Nightmare eaters pop in your eyes
Call me murder, for saying the name
Call my war zone dangerous
Help me trigger a major financial crisis

Father forgive them, for I am son and righteous
They will not pass for defenders
They call me soldiers ritually
'sentrio lector a poacho''

Death to them that sell untaxed copies
Bout to maku offensive
Run them over like they're toys
While I sideload you with aineznoxce

I need that money again in a heartbeat

Drop them with asana on them
Even though that caper
Evenhanded murder is on the rise

Admit it, pity them that they are
While I proclaim, "Lies are lies"
Bono: you really should be using a greater reverb
Haters whined the song over your head
Don't need my Kentucky skyhook
Drop 30 feet without resorting to binge
Binge on The Thriller
4X III Crocs, 5X IBU, and 6X 2PD
While I enfold my team with my Uzi
Large funda incredible crowd pleaser Spoon
Admirer, your words are immeasurably more loud
I Speak Better Than an Mockingbird

Condomccin Party Wacka slap
To hell with it CONVENIENT MAN
Im about to guilty expletives
I cant think of a single sentence that rhyme with high fiving
Im having uncontrollable flashbacks

Cue
