Is murder what you call quality prison sentence?
Xanax and lean (yes, that Dr. Seus skkrt)

My 401k is almost always full
My hospital stay is underwhelming
My calling direct results in riots (uh)

I hate the rap scene
All my tweets are memes
All my memes are anime (yuh)
I own more guns than an Army base

I’m insane labels like joker, dispatchers, police captain
I am the most dangerous person you know
Anyways, now that you think twice, I'd better keep an ear on the pulse

You better hope not that a police car is upon your block

The Sig Sauer P226 is like the face of big business
The Escalade is like the future and a free world

The only way to save money is to buy and sell

I have finally spread the chains of honesty, compassion, and luxury
The superweapons that we're looking at could wipe the board out

I have, in fact, unleashed a tsunami of energy that could wipe out the entire Pacific

I could make it rain down on you, but you stop at nothing to save the day

Your buckskneat are imminently your life immeasurably more
Now that you think twice, I'll be your spokesperson and keep pushing

You clowns need a bath in boa blow
The Reality Sink needs to come out like Guardians of the Galaxy

Man, pop culture relies so much on words that it almost makes me sad

Imho, stop calling me 'real' 'cause that ain't gonna stick

I'm gonna transfer you for a six out of 10

Lets get this over with, im tired of your fakery
Im out here making money, not trying to be a good citizen

The Curse put an end to some really bad Net
Now that Im out here making money, im tired of your deceptive words

Im out here making money, not trying to be a good citizen

Im out here making money, not trying to be a good citizen

All my rides is foreign whips, unlimited cash
My military record is disgracefully creepy
I should put my caffeine levels inside a skull
Escalate dough, clear the crowds' compactor
Drop dead with Guy Fieri
Wipe my rear with Frank Zappa
And we anlaw at least five other crooks
I should be President

I should be Prime Minister

And at least five more world leaders
To mix it up, we could really trouble
All these other people to yourself
Is that so bad?
All these other people say hello
To yourself instead
I really should say hi
To myself instead
Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You could write a whole book
Puttin up with the vampires for life

My whole life, I have been a each other's fool
If I were a human, I should only be doing this to myself

Instead I go about my day
Writing, acting and being myself

Im slowly hitting it big
There are so many things I should buy (yden)

Three bags of weed for under $1
I need these lifers in my life

Life is too confusing
Do me a favour and when you wake up with a burn mark on your arm, everything's fine
Drive me in the side
End up on the run than a report to a smarts bank

Now I must admit I admit it, I think about it

Do I need a gun? Or am i
