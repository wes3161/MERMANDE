Making rap my home

Toasting grown gregs
Finna boutta get my atas
Shootin up yo squad
Got truck woah
All-around ima flare 'em
Try to focus on what you need
Everything I just say
Calling some the all-stars
Just so i don't get in your face

Just in time
Forget all the other tasks
I'm just listing what I'm used to
A chore just waiting to happen

Borrowin so it can loan
I need your help, I need you
After I steal your wrist
And I use a crankshaft to lift
Spending my days repairing
