Hi there brother! I'm Brendan
two things first - substance abuse problems
medical marijuana use (an overused healing tool) and obsessive compulsive disorder (a pervasive need for more)
mental health problems (out there trying to mess with me!) and
mental anguish (is this the beginning of something really bad)
next, disorder with solitude (I don't want anyone else hearing about it)

compulsory love, hard-work, dedication, and hard labor (I really need that)

I am terrifying you with my never ending supply

'Makin dough, makin dough like Solly Raphael
makin dough, makin dough like Rocky Mountain Rental

Advanced auto parts combined with pesticide use
I be cause if you want to bring democracy to this place then stop making terror movies
