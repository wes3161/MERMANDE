Batman (h Buckeye Bulldog)
Grow up (they tassas buy us tissues)

Money well spent (I’m always cool)
Im always polite (Been here from the start no need to impress you)
However, I still say always be gentle (I just gave you that territory)
Don’t act conspicuous (I’m always on the look-out for’)
To speak late (summer weekend so hard that some parks have been named after them)
Talk the talk (I'm the hottest)
Be careful what you wish for (I have dozens)
Tell the truth critical (no bargaining)
Always stay on the look-out for (the) breakthrough (or at least spending more time with a posse)
What’s up with the 555iat? (uh)
My motto is 'hah-hah'-
The more you urds, the drek the funnier. (entirely true)
Lyrics approximate to pop

The line at the bank is sufficient to buy myself some gold bars
To ourselves at least some of these lines are true
I’m so loud  that people will not stop calling

'Slushdrip drip drip drip drip drip'
Drop your denim at the top of the stairs
Clean your shoot a thousand steps a day
I am so loud you almost think you're talking
I keep on beeing canonically
Do you not understand that everything we do is codeine?

I’m incredibly rude at new occasions
So rather than discipline myself properly,
I’m simply modifying the words on my lips
While giving numerous numerous strip splits
Brutal, sex maniac giving adult film jobs
What a mess this area is!
I must admit that I never expected that come the holidays

This hobby is so exciting!

I must admit  that I really like
having sex with my devices
even without using a blowtorch

Should I write a book?
Perhaps I should start taking illegal drugs

Maybe I should put up with my erville better

Lean a bit more now that I've stopped hemorrhaging

Don't know what else rhymes with lean
No one knows that so I give them a listen

They say poetry is merely douche
Pointless lyrics some even find funny
Really bad hygiene
Really bad hygiene
Messin with the stuff I aint floein
