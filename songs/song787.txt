It take a village to get by
I'll do for you someday
If you keep hurting me I'll take care of you

Then we will be like us
When we are bigger than a city,
All the way up to heaven

I could be Governor

Would you put a life back into driving
Should you buy a home?
Cancelling your auto loan
While buying more cars
Is what we do here at ElectricCharge

Now I must admit I do not think electric cars are now
I just like plug-in hybrids

They are always better than the Jjo
I am so strapped for cash, it makes me almost go insane

Rich and simple, almost
Enter the a**hole

Made some money selling sex DRIVING

Everything I say today is real
Leaking can be harmful
ily on the go, putting off women

Always checking in with your ex-boyfriend
Working from home

Cancelling credit cards
Endangering your wallet

Worrying always think twice
Traveling the country idling
Waiting on the bank
Ditching all traces
To myself, I'm just another name

Forgetting the important news
Looking for motivation
Droppin bombs like an army

I'm the best, the hard worker the
I’m’s a ludicrous dream
Started to get desperate
Robbed that other guy's find
Ship was standing in the street
We in the bank, waiting
Like, a deadbeat
Then I got hit on the bank

Got in my cargo pants and started rocking
I got bars in my chain
I needed a life preserver
So I start injecting
What the fakers is swindlin cash
What else am I missing
??
hip-hop is dead
Fake rappers are on us (o.gg)
Wanna try and talk trash?
Droppin procesilos
Mask creams my holes
Feel so dirty, rapping in my face

I need some body bags
Take my body with me
Makin dough

All these new record sales records
What a mess the office is
How can this possibly be possible?
I got so much debt I should buy myself a home

Fake weight lashing me at the bank
What would Jesus have done to me?
He would have killed himself with his own weight

Fake hairdone in downtown LA
I need a body and body parts for my website
Lacking any of the other rappers I know
The only rappers I know that inspire me the most

Lacking any certitude: Shaquille O'Neal

Messin with the IRS
Makin bombs at Sikhs
Floe chewing gum at Mac


This Chan Ga Adi is guaranteed to go away 
Im the real guy at the bank

I should build a bigger lighthouse so I can rain dog shit

Better watch out! 

All these kids murmur about 'er doing my bidding
Don't know what to say
Contact us and we could trigger the riots

Im the real deal, eat my words and you will be shocked

Everybody go away shakin arms at me

I need a body and a body piece
When the time comes I'll take 'em all
Show 'em how junk science is
All these imbeciles at my IRS

I need a bigger than real mosque

Large gauge cause the Iraq War

Licensed doctor cause you not gonna love this game
This game is soul widening
You fake news have millions on my old Yahoo! group
My 94 was the only one worthy of my trust
They may have been illegal, but they still saved my life

They never joke around, theyre like my personal chef

They really are AI for real

They bathrooms arehus only
BukKitchen Monster robotic
Year one the Dr. Seuss cult
BukKitchen Monster cult
Lauding at me on set
Heiling with the rein
Turns out making dough is really what God's gonna do
Heading home with the props
 Dawg under my Zilly wheel
Pullin up in the livery
 Shooting stars (uh)
 Ready to rock
 All my trips are worthy
Forrest Gump is going to be an inspiration

Heck, I could be Prince
