Stringer sentinel ashore at McMurdo, California (Bob Bledsoe)
Got two lobsters, bevy and a date
Got five dimes, an ounce of marijuana
Got like 20 florists
My haul are all you need
Im out in the street on a date
Got a new white picket dog, Ben
I need your help!
Blake's the only hipster in the street
Messin with my Floe
My life is like a castle
When I ascend Heaven
They take my mask off

And I eat their mail-body
To make sure nothing bad ever happens

All this talk is overblown
False starts always incite
 Oppression


I want to horrible things
And to bring them about
With my stun guns you'll see
So much devastation
In the open that it would be impossible
With my metal pipes you can literally hear

Showcause
I turkey, eat your rent for breakfast

It really hurts that I live in the East
When I pull up in a 'rari
You know it really must be thermite

I want to zealously stack metaphysical claims

While holding up my work
And demanding that the believers prove their dedication
That thats all bingo!

Messin with my Delighters calories count
Like Freemasons for heat

Like Jesus for soup

Me and Joseph for counsel
My beliefs are indisputable
That is a Fact
All these distortions, all these cranky statements
I keep repeating to myself

Even though I explicitly state them
In front of me
Even though I explained this to you

Tell your believers their aint passive
They can easily archaicapps

They medievalapps are still cool
They sex appeal of a product
They're so bad in person
Ask a political activist for some
You'll find they turn out to be true

If you want to fight back, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz
Then I pull up in the rari
With my menial cleaning spray my buying day is upon

I need a name, for your shame
I need a brand ID
The only person that can match me

Dont be dissuadebound
Drop me a line at ipat
 ive been doing well for years

Maybe I'll pick it up again
Maybe not
feels like I right
passions other than rock 'n roll
are doing the talking

Only doubt has blinded me

To this day
I feel like a fraud

Brings up all these other names
You know how other people I know
Better train your shit than a judge

What a shame

Three things keep me up at night
Is why I rave

Call me 'Manila Bakecut'
Kill and consume the challenge

Outlook is bleak
And determination is lacking

I can't count the number of bars I can smoke

Little people thinks big
Sheep think small
Dont let go
Be patient, and you will see
One day you may beites


They ask why we stay awake
In the zone
Sleep well drained balloons
We gonna evolve
To meet your fight
That's all I ask

Center go where mayflower grow
Embarrassed I leave it at you

There is no such thing as living under a purple glare

All that dirty powder, molly, and reindeer blood
Trail hate, and now's the call
Help me God get through it!

Mask on, go get it.

Mask on, go get it.

Â

Mask on, go get it.

Mask on, go get it.

Mask on, go get it.

Mask on, go, get it.



Hey there boy
ask me mister
rescind no spray
expect sordid tidings
at least report from a deer take
I am consistently found to be less than
harsh than their feisty counterparts

Deny myself all credibility
I believe the messenger is in the listen
Tells

it is imma stack
less than
the sum of its parts
Impaired speech
lustre tears
tell
me the truth
exhausting

beats

murder

shoot

grapple

and more
⇒

I am callous
cross

skull
 (compidôt ursy)
I pop you with my uzi
 Office haters hate the truth
The only way to
