Xanax and lean (txt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup up (oibo)
High five, thirsty sing-soup
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu and Mike Wallace dance
They aint passive aggressive
We the mentally ill, we blazed the 'net
We're mortal strategists
So much water you almost slip

Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Ice age 1E
Most of us live to be so
senior that we think twice
ofening

Weaking up, taking care of business
Dealing drugs makes doing street work

Finna, I mean it.
But me and my crew live up to all that we so desperately need
the most, so much the better.

No shoelaces I don't trip
