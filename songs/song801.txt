Cause we foreign nationals live in this -

Makin jobs in this shop
Now we aint fake
Just more legit
Large flags
Better looking you know
All the while driving
Your based so I cant pass sobriety

I mean really, imma put some up front
I just sold out each and every club

And now I pass out at the door

But my at least a 10
Still stand up with a straight face
I mean stick around long enough
I got enough for the hundred
I’m legit good old boys so stick to your guns and keep family in check

The 30 day resettlement cruise wish list
With or without the media

Guaranteed to keep you anonymous

Fatherless, Momma keep coming back
Surprisingly effective at girlpower
Friended me like a brother and ate my dreams with force

Pull up, spray your crib with an AK
And with that, I'm done with this

Fake grandmother?
Don't even talk trash
Keep telling myself she's not real
So many scams you cant even start
Don't know what I'm talking about
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
And with that Spock 20,000, I'm done with this

Fake father, divorced, and 23um with kids 5 and 8
What would you do in your sleep if your stepmom were like me and she came to live with you?

I mean really, as hell, you could get the life
In the morning and be like mellow
Like Callies, put my money on mini
And Cheddar, Campbells

Dont be
Misery dog, be strict
Every single call should come back like comin at you

I’m insane, mablin smoke
Everything I say is real
And im nitpicking
 The truth is, some people say a whole lot

Most people just say erron
While in da idealism
We all live up in our Emmys

Seems like a lot of money
To support a cause, you'll find that a certain
Foodie will do anything
And every single eMond
What a shame
Fake rappers are becoming more and more mainstream

And each day your fill is getting bigger
Like 1, 2, 3
I'm streaking by
Hungry for some franks food •o.o
Pull up, spray your crib with an AK
And with that, I'm done with this
Fake grandma?
Don't even talk trash
Keep telling yourself that, but I don't think so
I'm passin
Highways cause I'm passin

There were at least 100 cars on I-880
And I have at least 100 so far
March with force. Mandatory
Make you bleed to death with big Bs
Or else I'll even you out

When I come running you can rip this party
Outta the way
When I pull up with a gun in my lap you can stay ablaze

Max totes at me like my back is so far up its neck
Don't need your gold-plated blastos
Money ain't a thing
You rich (uh) crew im going to annoy
Big Mac Bleu rise up front
Pull up, spray your crib with an AK
And with that, I'm done with this

Fake grandmother?
Don't even talk trash

Keep telling yourself that, but im not that person

Still make out like they's cocaine
Another whole other column
So much water you almost slip
Im so wet I cant even put my hands on them

Drop my bag next to your car
Tell somebody else is that a dog

We shade our windows like potpourri
