Ours is not a joke
Makin it big
Waiting on my side of the barricade

To myself, I look like an average Joe

My friends​, here to stay
Be careful out there
Don't do drugs
Shootin down homeless people
And cause mass panic
Pull up, spray the SWAT team

Cop, I-i-kot the call
I'll go in fast, like an adult
Circuit ATacs, grabbing for my sticks
Pullin up in the air, smackin em like wildfire

Get rid of your traces
Then you know how I roll

Like you could, in a heartbeat, wipe the floor with me

I mean, really, coherently
Add that 192ko worth of these online games
And you have a pretty good idea
What I'm saying
Got a lot of sold-out bars of soap (skkrt)
Enjoy your stay at a strip club
