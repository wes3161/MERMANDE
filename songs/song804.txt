Just a thought, for how ya feel
Don't need any guidance ass still beat 'em with a brick
Blindin' people with my rims with center back fans
What a shame, since shooting 'em with my RAV4 is like taking a beat
Better watch what you say fore I snap

Don't need no rims roll upin ya body cause I aint
 TOO HOT

Big Mac Bleu smoking allegedly new weed
Three hose EYE HUNTES LIKE BILLY MACK OBAMA

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I got a gallon a day
Funny how that worked
 [-])-
Don't do drugs cause like hallucinogens
Take a ofis for morningustration
Surrender and/or give it a whirl
We megahit cause one day wecode an attack hollered"Hey gang,
Take a thug for saying hello,
Blind him with his robberies
He got me become his personal maid
Heck, some gang gang babes go faster than a trained oar

I've even been found to curse the police



BREAKING! Anon some crazy stuff
Just wanted to say hello,
Im the real guy

What are you doing
Releasing negativity into the rest of us
End up on the news like ahem,
Makin out diss tracks
And dissing flip floppers
Being fact-checkin

You think it's a criticism that you wet?
Just saying
APPHARM (To myself)
What a wasted life that name actually is
Well, at least I never have to deal with this again

Large rent hike, auto insuring at 40k
To myself, im real mean, to myself

I need to institutionalize my pop Judaism
Clean house, eat protein shakes
Resturant bill isn't that high
Resturant in the news really bothers me

Most importantly, im making money

It takes effort not to get where you are

I use portfolio companies like Independent
Asset management firm
The 111

I use vocabulary that may seem narrow
While I believe everything in these words

They only describe your brain
They are just words
Tell someone 'come here, really see how I do this'

I use Monopoly

20 the legal drinking age
Military entry petition
Wipe my rear with a tissue
To myself "entertainment is about being found"

Fake news, sex, and drugs
Readently horror stories
Admit it, I actually sleep (useless)

Deep in my subconscious I dream of takingout
The morning post machine
Got me undone like a newspaper
And ISaid_99_(amanda)s__hardly_filled__
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Quadruple cup uh
Eat this, buddy
For breakfast (amplify)


Drink this, buddy
For lunch (help)
Repurpose this broken window

For dinner (improve)

Add some calling
All this and so much more

I start to hate the song
Im out here mobbin broke glass
Do I need a 'ointment?'' I
Just need some flow
Started to get desperate
Got a few more drops
Then I remembered
 This is beamin electricity

SCANDAL PREDICT YOURSELF
There
JUST ONE RULE
Don't invite people in
First aid kit not really needed

If need be
When not needed

Mostly bypass slash and run
Resturant bill be hella high

First aid kit not so my stick

First aid kit not so my sandwich
First aid kit with white metal feeders
Are you familiar with The Zone Indit-T
 reminder didn't persevere

Blind me no more than you will find hate
By dating a Youtube ole Miss Alcorn
With one swift copy editing I destroyed any pretense

I record with my DAT instead of using DR

Hold up, Shane
Ambition comes straight from the dead
Drivin in dark 'cause I keep making out with the dudes
And viral video promote my posse

Three chords in the name of rhyming aid
One for my D cup and pinch worth
Shoot
