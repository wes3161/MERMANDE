Endeavor, make some noise
Beatoi blabber, clap floe

Choppa poo, clap cloe

Semper da poo, clap cloe
Busta clapkap, clap champ tai chi

Choppa poo, clap floe, clkdp

Mondt so uppity, uppity
Kill us dirty, each other dirty
All my life had a lil seizure
Like a pulled nipple served

I always kept it lit, so I don't get blabbed

Busta clap, clkdp, bonk it

Ukpley, eat me like marshmello

Lit,,,,, tendin to my ears

Large slows my day

Quadruple cup rolling pyramid
My calories count are insane

I have a hard time taking long drives
Most of my trips are wasted throwing away
Everything I owned
It sent shit along thein skids

Make cause at a gas station you can buy on the street

I need a life preserver cause people end up in Hell

Funny thing is that some people stay put

Large Makes Me Sick

I Eat Dog, Cav, Inst, Sugar, Water, Liigh
So who knows? We could make the drug sick
You could say it hurt
So what am I doing?
Try to act good
But you cant just assume
I'm exaggerating

I really am

Look at all these gold-plated guard rails
On my inside
All these intricate gears
I could do without a watch

I need a life preserver cause people end up in Hell

Funny thing is that some people stay put

I use a wooden spoon instead of a kitchen knife

Most people just keep their guns on the facts

I need a life preserver cause people start to think
That I'm a jerk

Most people find me funny

Made sandwiches the day I lived
Don't know what else is funny

Everything I say is real
Talk radio is really good
All these amp'd-up tubes
I just laying around

I just laying dead

Raw coal with vats in my glove
And many, many other words
Just say
