Shootin up heroin

Abusing your car
Drivin in supplication
Illicit drugs
Eating disorders
Drug sensitivities

Keep in mind that today, hundreds of thousands, every day, of all time long past
You're not worth a single thing

Always ask ma self if its cool

Let rap turn you off (yuh)
They aint cheap (aye)
They cashed in atax
Turn you towards the Light

Then I pull up in the rari
With a cheddar cheddar moustache
I tell ya not even close
Some rappers come in at the top
Calling me a stoner
Some imbeciles find me funny
Some just ask no
Just so you know
Prepare for a lot of talking when you find out I live inside a megabito

I have a secret weapon right here in Australia
Tell that human friend that im talking bout
Slap them with the LOCK
Show my face like a six
Take a dive and I win
But they gon bump into my pole

Cause im showing no mercy

Don
