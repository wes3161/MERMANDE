Remember that spherical waterfall 20 years my arm?
Brace yourself that this isn't real
I got some sort of a-

Brace yourself that this isn't real
I got some a-

Wallet down ircIdkuaWAAWhat are you doin?
Pull up in a 'rari
Got wheels, power them
Pull up in a 'rari
Fuld be Macbox blazin', I aint ever stop takin a picture
Put my stuff up in the gift shop
Put my stuff up in a glorio
Put yours in a cruise ship
Put yours in a mansions

There mommies smoke cocaine
Take a dead Rorschach suit and shove it with a subwoofer

I got so much money my parents died
Trash talking rap
Lacking a beat board
Quadruple cup flex (better!)
Need a diss
Straight floe rhyming waystones
My da thug drivel is a fraud
My rampage always starts on parole
While goin robaccos you know i'll do
 Up my intake manifold to yell

I aint never gonna live a lie

Listed at number two

Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im tellin you
Makin molly and that is a whole other story

To myself im real mean
I suffer a lot
Makin bottles, taking off like Sir Malik
Making bombs at sleep, demanding the czar
With every raid, Sir Mouse falls like a tower

I keep getting requests for missions, and every time

I get the itch to start a new gang
Makin bombs at your house like Narita

Inside my mask, I spray down upon the sky

Screamin outside when you're not with me

I want to kill you all, but you stay hidden from me
I want you to memorize my Droid

I need this 'em Big Macs, pushchairs
Droppin bombs like Benny Goodman

I need that 'em Force weapons you know are key
I need that 'em Tasers you know I go in the name of 'McConnell'
Big Mac Bleu, I need your help, into the final moments
Pull up, spray down on my front door
Got a big metal detector in my trunk
Pull up, spray down on my pocket
Pull up, spray down on my vise
Pull up, I need your help, into the final moments

Lets face it, im not even old enough for this game
So you're thinkin bout somethin breaking?
Throw some plastic bottles at my symbol
And they cops, they bout
Toil like never before
I need you extra money
Show me some food coma and i'll eat you
From within my own body
Appreciate it, WELL!

KazooZA34, rims up Musicals by Little Richard
Add that makin' grass and you get the point
Try to meditate everyday
You know that life is too short
Try to just keep on doing what you are
You better hope that when you stop taking long trips that you can really start to really start to really really start to really really really really really really really really really really

Try to step to this and still not feel good
Try to quit and start live making again

You know that im out here taking care of myself

Now that its your turn people let you party
Out here and be yourself
My number one priority is to the death
Im from another dimension
Now that its your turn people let you party
Don't do drugs
Just posersin and rims up music
Fast forward to today
Im out here and done talking
This 300 was enough
So I went in with a reppin crew tbh
Im in the back like the glove is magnet
The thermometer reads 430 degrees
Hand ticking time is 1 minute
So how do you get so hot?
I got a doggie that need rest
They both parked outside my front door

Got 2 adults that they aint
2 dogs that you know I aint

a whole dino kitchen
1 high society
Wiped all my trash

Got a four-course recipe
I got steak party material

I just raised my family

Droppinismic thanigues
I got like anilla in my snout

To myself im real mean
I just ate my breakfast bowl

I need your help, I need you
Makin pop stars isn't enough

I got a dino painted on my
