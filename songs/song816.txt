What a loser
What with all these women
You really need a career in today's money
Cuz I need some women for my music
Call me any other name cause I wont sing
Shoot you with a seven-gauge
While driving warm
Your body cannot deal with cold
Try their hardest and you will not disappoint

Drop low and forgetfulness
Startle like a snail
Shoot you with a nine-milli
While driving at night
Droppin bombs like heroin
Got them beyblades let down
I have enough so far
So many bars I could fill you with doubt

Most stuff must be uponus x
Some are on me, some not so much
I must be blessed
Untapped potential I possess
Will shake any nascent industry

200 mile ancora prohibiting opinion
Recent purchases satisfy my need
And my motorists sobriety
Top it off with paid parking

What better way to start the week than with sales?

Makin dough

Lit the Coach

Franklins Rot in the Shores
Feti Swear
Now I cant talk
When I live funny you ain't gonna find me on the news

All these Rihanna raps
I should write
 Haven't slept since I was like 6
I should lift my spirits
They may be giving up on me
Trailing us like Dominican life
Ring rings in the street
We need a Miracle Worker

One big life
700 chains of autotune
Take a beat, and you get me couriere
Cause enough damage in a day
Call me Jimmy Hoffa
Cause my voice is loud
Like Nicaragua
Don't do drugs
They'll really mess you up
You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
Take a beating and you get me rex

Livin high society
Dont get journalists

Most people treat you badly
Then they throw you in a back lot
And im the Cook they call the H

Pull out a fire and all these hacks come squashing it

Like every time haters storm your front door
I'm gonna blow your morale off

Even if it's for cash :D

All these other rappers sound like total trash

All these other rappers sound like total fakers
I just love how they look at me
Even though I look like theyjew

I just want to warn you before you start
Don't do drugs

All these other rappers sound really funny
