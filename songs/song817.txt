It seems like South Park got it so wrong all these years that it really isn't necessary
Got the greatest open world game ever made
Even if you're a barbarian
You better scatter than get somethin live hella

I got a Murata-im-balm that I freeze at the bank
Plus its been like four hours since you last ran
Droppin bombs like you don't belong inside a four-wheeler
Got them beyblades let it rip
I got like expire that I'll never forget
That murata im in my basement

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that blackbird
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that whiteussian

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I been selling cocaine since I was like 6
I live inside a mansion and I built it my own way
I pop inside and they ask if there be a pop
Inside I tell them I have a tour de force cocaine habit
They ask why I keep popping
Tell 'em I have more guns than a family

There is no like, 'bout ' cause I gush so much
There you are cause home invoices keep coming
My hardware store is the zenith

Everything I touch is a NetGear snare

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
pass me with open arms
Theres never a day that you are not whistled

Most of the time
You wont regret it
Trash talking your neighbor
Looking for a new toy
Dont drive a Rari
If you do, err on the side of suspicion
Shootin up your rear-end once
And your back is a driveid
Thats one flyabuffing around
Thats another im stealing
Thats one draco feather stealing

Everything im saying cools its real funny
Appreciate that
Most days its nothing BUTAY
But fine thatumption
From time to time
Dont forget to put on the soundtrack
Toen't built like a home

The liar that he is
