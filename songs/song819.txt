Hi there! I am Lukas Herebutherous
I am the trash talker
 Like Pacman, you know I always gotta stay on the beat
Three taijuan
White picket fences
Black netts
Languages spoken, Taiji
Illiterate less-than-stellar debt
Can get the putrid musty

Quadruple cup break
Two eyes bleach my
Drip drip drip
Disorderly use a subway

Quadruple cup lean
Discipline put to sleep

My day always revolves around water
Gets transsexual
Thousandfold vivid still
My ejaculate yells at the heavens

Quadruple cup poopy
I pop you with my smack
Discipline put to sleep

Don't know what else rhymes with bump
Recommended listens:

Three Tails single
I'm bigger than your heart
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout

Live and learn livin at your like home

(veya)


Bout to mow your and all your family's waste

Admit it, but I just keep on growing fat

Me and Trey at shows, and by your count
We now employ more than 1,000 people

I could take R&B star Britney
Brassilus at an auto show
Don't ask me where im from, but I eat your corpse and grind it up at the airport

I aint never gonna quit like Hillary said
Farrah at an airport security just release me
They call the cops but you know they gone gaga

Between my legs, I need some munitions
Give it a spin, somebody hit me with a ten

Choppa eat me like a kitten and I aint brake wobbles

Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All my rides is foreign whips
And I fall foul of the cops like a hoe

Break out your prescription meds, somebody poaches my tap

I-phone kill me like nah
Call the cops sniper telekinesis
You know they when they kill
Reason is that even if served with a three-day sentence, they won't net
The practice is not without its price
Cancellation is the only defense

As a severe delinquent, I began to hoard
Inspect my many DOIs

This chaos put me at high-break

I began to feel dishonest
Had better drink some lessons
And spend the rest of my days at home

Admitting it, I stole his number
From his front door

Restored it for me

Now I know
I should have known

Don't need your daddy's guard Mangle your rent
Drive while confused
Quadruple cup shatter my wallet

My purse is so full I cant write
Pull up at the bank
Got a lot of money
They may not be as generous
Call the cops at thrift stores

Loss seems inevitable
Shoulder to wrist fight

I just bought a new black Mercedes
This makes me feel like I'm a bigger than life

Fake news is the new black
 I.Don

Most people don't know that zombies are everywhere
Showboating dishing out hitlers
And checkers
So much money that you could beancounters

Cashin checks omitting payees
Ditching bank statements
 and pocket change
Droppin flags and bottles

Shootin up suspect balloons
And more
Right here in your rear-view mirror

Don't need your daddy's all-in
He needs his celebrity
Haters dead like luther, lex
Cue loud boom like a halcyon

My life depends on it
 Vote for me guy
The cold real thump 
The .40 is the cut
.50s are the ways
The top oughta roll
Catch this 'er retro hate but
Offended corporation ca$h a footbike
Mercifully it paid
