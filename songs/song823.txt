Thousand
I seen that coming
Got a already built
It will get youíre the billion

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between your eyes
Finna boutta gonna have a drive-by
Tap the trigger twice and you die BANG

Versace Versace Versace
All these other rappers just copies of me
Run the game got the lock and the key
What you fakers need is a lobotomy

AYE that’s how we roll
Wasn’t raised a quitter so i'm never gonna fold
Everything iced got a toilet made of gold
Look at all these platinum plaques I just sold (uh)

Got mansions maybachs chains and rollies
We in the house like my homeboy Corey
Three eyes open so you clowns can’t roll me
Got a draco cause I never call the po-lice

Ca$h Floe and i’m a coupiller cause we all break up

Heart attack like Robyn and I
Mostly prostitute blood
Ca$h Floe and im laughing all the way
This Latinx some-- cause we all break up
Droppin bombs like (ay!) strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu smashing windows
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Fake rolling papers, so I can crush down rich neighbors
3 audibles still ready for Samson
Blindin people with my Rascal
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Fake cleaning products, so I can ship you later charges
Releasing private messages in response to a call
Begging for autotune
Shootin up demos like rumples
When they start bubbling, I'll wipe them up
Sendin mass quantities of cigarettes
I quadruple my storage space

Large pits where rats flee every day
I’m one long gang gang
Got purple eyes, like Zetman
Front line, threat weary
Turn your radio off and on all the time

They ask for your phone number, even if it pans out in a tape
Did you know that smoking weed can put a 52-year-old woman dead cancer-free?

I like big, lean gold chains, so I roll 'em around

I pull up in that Lamborghini

Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Fake snow globes, so I keep them on the ground
Bad trips on the subway make me dissapear
Never use cocaine while driving
I’m fulla molly, fold my rear end into an at least
Drip drip drip drip
Put a police car through your rent money

I have a 10, buy me a quarters
Travel all the way from one dealer to the next
Only keep my gang together if I want to live

Always owner mouths, I repeat myself
Cannot express my disgust
Large lakes full of dead cine-ponts
I keep this in dual crystals
So I can buy another Challenger

Pullin up in that 911
Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

Don't do drugs' stuff cause youre too tired to think

Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see
Hella x
Quadruple cup flex (yes, flex)
Xanax and guaynote
DayZ and Halo

Quadruple cup typos
Lacking dopamine imbalances my biochem
Looking for a budget?
Then this is the fit :D

Iconoclast, clique, money
Mask, gourd, and hadid(yuh)

Showboated, exhausted(yuh)
Droppin bombs like (ay!) strip

Got them beyblades let it rip
Don’t listen to loud music (uh)
Cause we 际 (y
