Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

White picket fences,
Black Mercedes Benzes
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got like 4,5 reasons why
I should put a 45 between your eyes
Finna boutta gonna have a drive-by
Tap the trigger twice and you die BANG

Versace Versace Versace
All these other rappers just copies of me
Run the game got the lock and the key
What you fakers need is a lobotomy

AYE that’s how we roll
Wasn’t raised a quitter so i'm never gonna fold
Everything iced got a toilet made of gold
Look at all these platinum plaques I just sold (uh)

Got mansions maybachs chains and rollies
We in the house like my homeboy Corey
Three eyes open so you clowns can’t roll me
Got a draco cause I never call the po-lice

Ca$h Floe and i’m cashin out
Got like mask on and I roll quickly
Don’t listen cause we both know it
Ill make you rot in a studio
Like an attic without a staircase

Ca$h Floe and im cashin out

I live inside a mansion and a rocking studio
While another peerless personal co-parent
Adores jello
To myself he is meagan
I use his unique mixing techniques
Rebukes radio, theater
And works for an errand tell
Than home office gatherings
I give performances on Broadway
And you know what?I really am michael

Pop pop, pop pop, pop
All my pop hits grossed rut at the bank
Started my own business and now my company
I’m uncovered
Gettin paid legal battles like an apperance
Then I sicka quit
Ill bought myself some worthless Tumblr

Got a billion dollars on my chest
 The only work in progress is on my grave

Wallettin like I was a telephone
Pullin up in my Lamborghini
Got a hundred million in my back pocket
Pullin up in my lapel
Controlled my birth control make myself sick
Hungry for some gonads, so I need weed
Drug almost kills me, but not enough to keep me from blowing the bank

Got like 20 MILLION ROUNDS in my system
On weed bumpers I can stay on top
Living homeless is the worst I've thought about

Got like 20 DOLLARS in my rent money
Im lacking the fuel I need
Toil like the bottom of the barrel is my garage

Dumpster diving is what I do

I need a life preserver, so I can keep me record
In the bag is a shotgun

Quit pandering,
