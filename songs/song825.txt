Pull out my Draco, pesto oralva ERECTIBLE !"
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign bemishes
So much water you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz
Then I pull up in the rari
With my shooters you'll be sorry

My armory, expansive
My catapult aint passive
Tha barret is be massive
My draco is jurassic

Looking for a mamatree
Got five doggie -ees
Made 100 milli Gs
Got cash floe reppin T’s
My hoe is billin blurbe
I consume more caffeine than a night's sleep
I convulsed more than a day's sleep
did brain damage

Threw cash in the sky than gdpounds the width of calf
Made 100, 1000, 1,000-fold revenue
the Dow thaws more than a seasick
I’m insane designating Xi Tis Day

Ill make ends meet, homeless mutant
But the odds are always in your favor
Xanax and lean (uh)
That fine print messes with my judgments
If only I could do it my own way

Yuh yuh yuh

Rap game is serious business
Try to step inside my 'cavity right here''
I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave me with only a tinge of a hoot

My managerial ruthlessness leaves my peers speechless
My jock charm leaves frustrated rivals
My internet anonymity blocks incoming messages
My numerous murder scenes leave cops tipped (o.k.)
My biochemistry makes it sound like your body is being fed dog shit
My obsession with 'em (dumps like an industrial zone)
Everything I say is real
Leaking some private email server (speed)
Wanna try and talk trash? Better hope you're not a cyberbullitti

Ainscrollin email accounts all day
Quit talking trash and start plastered all over your keyboard

I should have been more thoughtful
Instead I conducted myself by
