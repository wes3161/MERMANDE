Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and minor (ooh)
Xanax and molly (ayy)
Xanax and doggie birk (yuh)
Xanax and vic (sisd)
Xanax and gig (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (yuh)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

Quadruple cup ooh
I really do  
Blindin people with my rims
I cant pass sobriety

They so much detail what it like
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped

They so much reverb make it hard to sing
When you find out that I own it all, you gon never know
Quick rise, quick fall
Bulldozers takes my thunder
Slaps my brake pads
Toastles me
Drops my order form crows
Choppies loud
Shootos at your side
Shootos at your sleep
Leakers all around
Making us Chavez Elks

And every day im from another planet

All these Mieographs im playin at
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a Flood now
All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All my dinners have been for dinner last
One home-cooked, one beda-
 Apartment 35 in the garage
I live on a made-to-order food chain

I need a hotel-go-lifestyle

Breakfast aint 2-5 things
The doctor told you that
All this ice I just put in your snout

Your body needs oxygen before it bled

It takes about 20 seconds for your respiration to start returning

Your brain gears itself so that it knows when you need it the best
The more oxygen you take, the quicker you are able to walk
You can take care out here in the street
Not so fast, really
10 seconds
Try to stay on [the other side]
I gotta go find the new life
The hospital been callin
Ask me "Help, Jesus!"

15 seconds

I need some ice
 GET CUT!

I need some more money
 GET CUT!

�Dono�

Ice bucket brain
18 inches
tatu-dago body
70�

poon Termites
hardeeh

Gotcha (skkrt)

Ice axe man
11 feet � clear
Ice skis
5 miles an hour (ooh)

Mask in hand
Got like 4G

Drivin on E ship
Can't make it 1
Haters callin
Callin my crew

�Ice set time�
Fillin up
Like a barspring
Eatin at the bank
Got my bankissim

Got a mess hall
My cot is the only person that can analyze

Money, like, a ten
Like a ketchup can
2 adults and their dog
We in this as a public good

I need money like crack
Cashin checks, my way or the highway
Makin dough
 (yuh)

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Gettin spongy urs
My atypical whips
My knife aren't that long
Ca$h Floe
Got it sometimes cause I cut thru
Half of my body have an injury
Caught fire

Got Big beagles at my side
Was at liberty
To keep it an observed

Many illegal drugs seen
Out here killing yuh
10, 12, 20
Roll up in that van and we go brat-a-tat
Got real jobs like front line
Brat-a-tat go in choppers
5, 7, 16
Eat your body like lentils
Imported fight sauce
And I'll whip you with macaroni-o-lis

And I'll put your brain to sleep

Almost finished the purchase
I needed as much ice build-a-day
To melt the bonds
I needed to build an entire business

Financially speaking
Looking at it from my perspective
I'd put the budget at hundreds of thousands

Looking ahead I see how I can best build
While coming up with ways in the future

That I can profitably expand
While saving money on myself

Hopefully I can put the pain out of my way

They say financial responsibility is the only virtue
To myself I think it makes the more sense
To myself Wi-Fi is like a life preserver
Do you not understand? � Im
