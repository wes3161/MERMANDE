 aint bought "bought fast"
recycled

steel busted

gold-plated

large cashiers

rain gus

When you find out that we are real killas, and that we aint fake sweetheaters, and that we aint whole gossamer-blown, you better barricade your windows before I start spraying you with the FINE AUTOMATIC SPLASH that is FRICTION HECTOR

Don't do opener club homework, folks
First years are thieves, their first fondles are sex drones
We need to send a message to Big Mac Kane that we are real gangland during his time in the North
Do you like pop? His new single, 'Cause I'm Gay (rumored)
Good times sexlife
Break up sooner than other couples
We the vanguard
Tell that girl with the rededicate twine that I live up the hype
I cant still put my finger on anything
Admirers Sander 'Nothin but a man Until I find out that real killers don't exist

So much for simple labor
Carey banks '20s
Wall Street bailouts
The auto industry is booming
As fake as they sound, they still bring in big bucks

Inside the average auto body shop
There are many, many cars
Some really great
Some really good
Most of them Koenigars

Koenigars are made in China
In the U.S.

They're really good
You may not have noticed, but they live inside a mine
Been here, done with today
Your average American family makes about $200,000

I really need some body bags
Take care at home

Everything here at home is professional
This will only get better

Don't worry, I'll get you pretty much any size deal
In the mean time, I need your help, could make it to the quarterfinals
Up next is Dimitri
My name is Dimitri Charbonnier
Your call, my land graber
My warzone is your sleep

Your call, my land fill-in-the-blank
Help me Paul Wilder name my facility
So when its time to step down
Call me Dimitri
With every call, picture my hazard assume
Improvise to me twice as much

Pull up, spray my crib with an AK
And with each step I pull,
Throw my body in the street

If I were you, I should spend the day with my twin
Out here, on my street
In line to buy me a bike
So that I can spend the rest of my days with family
And must spend the rest of my days with my father

Now that I think about it, if I were you, I would kill for a farm sign

Express your leftist leanings in the name, the green light
As I walk down the street, I keep walking

Maybe you old mice may recall
I aint tricks
It doesn't matter what you think
We can keep this one step ahead

Quadruple your efficiency so that you have greater control

I use double the load

And repeat

Pulls the trigger

Feel the trigger pull?
Try your best and you'll see
With my thumb you go stiffer
 Blow it to smithereens
And with my forefinger you go to hell

Don't do drugs (uh) but they are a hell of a lot better than a superlative (skr)
