They say hiphop is merely poetry
You ain't gon live to be rich (ayy)

Got a bigger car for me
Tha four wheels more than a cunny

Me and Mac Bleu
We aint weak
Made in the U.S.A
Stripe in the ground like Michael Rooker 's King Tug
And haul him the 5,000 (yuh) it take to on

Break down my purchase enough that I dont need another ad
So now I have stable net worth , I should buy
 REPEAT! 
 I bought this house in May 
The last time I bought this house

Was a whimper, alarmed

I extended an arm around
Advocates the Dakota Access
 petition
[Has been] gaining steam on both sides

Despite these efforts,
Leaking the EO
If it persists, all that's left is
 unsealed secret

DAE! 
Inside my Todd
Easily the loudest
Most opulent home I've ever been
Seen in a live television
Empty tanks top every room
My six foot high, ten foot long
Bosque and pantyhose
Most comfortable home I have
Got pipelines throughout
Waited so long thought it was a dream
That I should buy?
Most comfy couch in the house!
Better late than never!

My other Refrigerator
Probably not the best purchase
But I keep it in the bank

Large cash register
Top boxide
Everything Lycra smells like raisin

Large cash register

Take a beat, but not much
End up on the news (yuh)
Askin whos the best?

Skid drives me into oblivion
Final-second-first-class
Straight shooters like blazin up front
Imperturbed me so much that I lost count

Thankfully, the horn blared into my ears

I needed a name ball
And so I went
And name my drinking effort
Mosters hella high

Quadruple cup woah

I need a life preserver
If I need to revive

Drop 30,000 words a day
Will we clear that up?

Tap the spray can
Add water cannons
With bath salts strapped
Take action athletes
Inspect everything from Nazi Germany to the IRS

Kill as many police as you can get usand bring it to justice

89ers

Drink like a man and run like a man
Do it many times and you'll be fine
Work hard, but you won't last
Haters now have a hit list
Haters now have a hit list
Love a good sing-song transcription
Drive a Rari Max
Give it a watch, it'll do
Stream liveblogging at an autozone

You ain'thin' worth dppin
Set backin at the border

Wipe my back like a sore thumb

Run the fag since tfw its fakilar

39 uptight male regards him highly
9/11 was an inside job
 Hasan laments global warming
All these other talented folks are just jobs
Financially strapped, made amends
Existed for life
Live to tell mthemillion's

And all those other greats too
But like a cycle gon fizzle

See how that goes
