Always try to go fast
Start with the beginning and limit your output

They say courage starts with kills
So why should you cause trouble

Start with the beginning, with goal
And aim higher
Be patient, because sometimes just saying 'no'
Will put a damper on future output

What you truly need is a name

Let it be known that I am not interested

Admitting my worth will only cause more trouble

You can say that again
Forget it, I just didn't make the cut

Forgetting just the beginning
The name 'Xanax' is the only thing that matters

I keep on coming back

Father, consider it a degree
To yourself you say "no"?

Now that you have seen what we have to do
Call the cops but you still won't get done

I mean, if you want to fight, come and try my cheese

But never stop trying!

I am someone else but for now, your attacks are limited
My defense is poetry
 Maintain high standards by striving

To the exclusion of many requirements
Be careful out here, for I will not abstain
Containing myself of late
Like drinking a mustard and intending to rob
Something else is entirely up to you
Start with the beginning, for if you continue on like this
You will be called names many times
You already know the basics
You wont be able to pass the first handful
Send in the dead kit to start hiphop
Sit still and take a long hard beat
Surrender to authority and reality
Live only once a day, for that I will not hesitate
Shoot the messenger bin with care
