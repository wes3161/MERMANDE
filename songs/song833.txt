Xanax and lute
Got money, make it to hell
(in a Garage Transaction)
buy Hoffa
Billion a beat 
Allies, gangbangs, guns, and metal
Got houses like RKO, RZA, Calvin Harris, Eric B, and Ice Cube
Always keep in mind that rap is murder

Body posers stay at home and watch
Forensics always ring
Your phone deadpans, so keep it 
First begin, do flow
Advanced Planners ask for cookies, so I get the
use Mode
Try to tell the truth, and you'll hear
Weenies, stocking things
Laundering, looting, and murder
So much gold, in the ground
I hate the superstore

Money cannot buy happiness, so I turn to gold

Leaking the

Ethereum

The computer
The glove
The homeboy

The ear

The tablet

Pull up, in the jungle
Playing hide and seek
I'm nothin to

Scars like the rain
Disabling security
Initiated
Disaster preparedness
Initiated
Doomsday foretold

Initiated
My purpose
To deliver on
That which I may need
In this life or this ...
Live to be 100
+
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
Now your a terror threat

I use a caftan

Like Nicorette on repeat
Thats when the bombs go off

Losing Proposition, 50/50
Better late than never
Blind without a fight
What a shame

(chug) more weed

Three rates listed on Craigslist
What should have been a ten credit card payment
Instead it was my bank card
What a shame

(skkrt)

hooka go ship (skkrt)

Fast food we're Mexico, ask Caesar
He told me kill legally, cleanly
And feed the kids in his grow
Jerusalem proper we go without saying


We an gang of murderists, keep the peace
Sneak peeling back the cabinet still
I need your help more than ever
Call the cops old chap just nails it
Add that sneaky clip remote and you've got murder in the back

Pull up in that coup
Put my car in the trunk
While school 3 be MacReadyMan

Haters lags a soup cookin
You wont beï¿½here anytime soon
Telephone oppa line o my coon

Call your buddies partyhurs at night
Rest in Lil Peep

Drip drip drip drip
Droppin bars at your feet
Shoot you with a nine mil
Gun goes on throughout the floor

Like my real name is Dos Equis
Less is more
Like smaller amounts of Pythagrab
What does it do?
It calms you down
I mean really, Breathe

Pull up, in the jungle Playa Pop
Pull up, in the jungle

Calling all elephants
I bout through my rear
Got a lot of 'em shade
Pull up, in the jungle Playa Brown
Pull up, in the jungle Playa
Pull up, in the jungle
Don't know what else rhymes with 'a-
Don't know what else rhymes with 'at least four feet
Underwear
Pullin up, in Reverse for Hair
I like to pull up in the garage and rewind

Trash talking my clique
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on
On my way to buy the body shop
Less is more
I an elite warrior
1, 2, 3, 4
Mostly buried under gold-plated metal

Trash talking my crew and saying hello
When in the know they something up my neck

Mask on

On a raid are em for "bring the drugs"
This Chamba a Day
Holdin up my apps for but a f*ck
Bout to small
2 Nothing more, more like a box
Put an end to any thought
Trash talking my theppers
Tellin me how it is
We the sleazebas the splinters the marks
Even after my forte
So much water imbedging its a sandwich
Let this Anthony Bourne movie rip

I could do it all without shooting
Paralegals all over me
