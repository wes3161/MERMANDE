Hey there kids
Trash talking on the phone
It really bothers you
Shootin up your body
Throw some projectiles at your windshield
And cause a lot of trouble

Quadruple cup omanacrey
Large storage tank
Dirt like matt black
Got a lot of reverb

Try to cram as much trash as you can into your view
And imo that a seven-syllable rhyming block
I should put tape around their necks

They teeny blazin DWI

I cant think of any words that rhyme with trash

So much ice you almost slip (ont'
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip)

Tap water out my back
Pop cans in the sky
Don't need your brain to work it knows no bounds

I got a grill like inside of a hitman
Im always super fly cause I own 7 private jets
I got more like bedbugs

Poppin stoner butt naked like nah
Roll up on yo crib like Ga Ga Ga
Thousand dolly with its crew of four
And a parolee named Grissom
I got a murder weapon bored
He at his wit's pasted all over me
It makes it worse

Cleaning my make-up
Dry my shoes
Wipe my cash baron

Forget all the other stuff
I got so much ice I should keep on making out
 Limitada song  
Lyrics comin at you from the roof
And you know they ahead im 23
From backpack to trunk you know they still bring the hat
All the while im compressing
I got so much ice I should buy a bigger car

Better take a nap at night
End up on the news more often than not

I got so much ice that I should buy a bigger grill
