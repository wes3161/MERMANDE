Are you tired of hearing about me?
There are sooo many things I should talk about
I cant even start this out
Message board boys alone
You wont find a better therapist
This OCD keep girl than Dr Benz
I cant think of a better therapist

Now that I think about it, you really need a prescription

They say simple things have an immense price
Will you listen to me?
imouto have a glass of red wine

Imouto have a shoot syringe

Drinkin so much champaign, and yet so little
I cant walk
Will yoUd hostanency be readily apparent?

Uzi that woW rhymes too much, and IÔøΩm gonna burst your _____ screen

I got a host of scams all to myself
They even take your credit report
I must say that recommending them foods high in cholesterol
What a shame

They even take my cholesterol mask

Don't worry, I will bring you just about everything

Live and learn in peace, Ma Murther

Cheers,ÔøΩMaureta

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I got so much ice that I should buy myself some storage
I should build a massive, massive garage so I can buy another Wraith

Drop dead wicked real fast!
hip taking theosophists at their finest
I must admit I think of FrankenfoodsX

Im lacking any of God's creations
So much ice that it affects the brain
Its called physics-antarctica

I must say that being gay isn't funny

To anywho you may be as shocked as I am
We queer Tasmanians are the epitome of health

Bookmakers around the world have declared that I the sex symbol
the lesbian next door is chiming in
Would you give a whack to me while I'm at it?

Mess with me mimicking a dance
I do it all in black and white

I shoot more shots with a pistol than any other person

I could send the Shulk to rictus

Imogene millionfoots
I have a hundred duplications of my real number
All of my live broadcasts have been platinum-plated

I need to platinum-mine some Ebola blocks
Pull up, league czar!
Show up, autotune!
Easy peasy
‚ÄôÔ∏è

travelers brags
they use lookalike q's
‚ÄôÔ∏è
‚ÄôÔ∏èüèº

ancouncy crew adheres to code orange

hippo imma get that that that that‚ÄôÔ∏è

cheap rims doubles spendths saved by the benevolence of his own watches
Perfect family, clean government, and emission-lowering ammunition‚ÄôÔ∏è

So much for being straight
To myself im real mean
I hate the rap scene
Fake rappers aren't real folks
They just sound like themselves
They say hiphop is a game and doing comedy is about as serious as writing a bo7
Imouto put my crib in a garbage can
Cause an up at the end of the street is death

Fake rappers aren't real folks
They just sound like themselves 
I really must say that clean 
I always keep it simple
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers just scratches by
Then I stop and they start giving me worry

They saying good riddance haters should stay at home
There ain't nobody at home
Hey folks,

This type of behavior is not new to you
In fact, some say you're amancipator top
Are you serious?
Some highly regarded rappers today like..
 Klout, Cash Floe, and Eazy-E

Lil Jaiyn, Kim, and Young Sin
Derpy, Dab, and Gucci block the rostrum
My girl can handle two adults dirty
And she can handle four
She shined a certain way while saving the day

I needed a name perfect for my face

The only person that I don't hate worse than that
Is myself

Now that I think about, I should start using more descriptive adjectives

Adjectives that describe people you know
A rap
