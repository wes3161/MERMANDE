Cammy you a MEEG (ayy)

Tap at the foot of the staircase
Trash talking Pope Francis

Droppin blow drips like plans

Got a lot of fresh flies my speed than something big
We ball stuff, like a trapeze
Put another way, ho ho who the hell collects
When we govin at the bank
I'll get you some cash
Cash patches, a gate
200 spray can
Drip drip drip
Like the bank at high noon

Pull up, promenade
Hold up, holodeck
This aint a game
Just step up make some waves
Don't need your stripes we all aint great
Drip drip drip drip
Karma put! ka mai voodoo hya
Bass whip use bump-kicks
Three charges on the job, my rhyming speaks
Lack thereof need I mention again
Ill put my civilian client ahead
Drip drip drip drip
Pop pop pop pop

I keep it onehunnid

Droppin rock hard pay skin
Drop like a bombshell
