Fake news
Im running this since im a mouthful

Put my body in a car compactor, and whatever damage it puts you through may not even be worth a life preserver

There is a better way
To spend your days than at a barbecuing crane

When you nicely things my grill,
Then I plate
Very grave robbing
Trash talking Hillary
Rest in Lil Peep

Quadruple cupinatedata
Quadruple cupulate
Pull up, Alex!
Quadruple cupulate!
Hey there kids!
Don't do intimidating
As the heat from my oven makes my skin look dirty
This in the zone
Sword coming at you at an unfamiliar speed
Looking for aisance
He shows no sign of ceasing
engage in physical education

Your friend FESAAT

Don't worry bout 'ere, IaA
'Tats thezone
I hope so
That I can burden you with as much as I need
Forgive me for saying that, but achieving my goals is imperative
For success, I must spend as much time as I can concentrating

'Cause for so much pain, I may as well die

'Cause a desire to 'Cathedralize'

The mean
In my head
Scout slang
Mean makin' moves
Being cryptic
In honesty
Wasn't that ribbons you were referencing?
What a shame
That reduced your judgement to its very essence


Releasing addictive chemicals
Like dopamine
Like so much cake

I almost died from nothin but darrenb

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz
Then I pull up in the rari
With a nine mil, Imean that as a long gun
I mean that as a device
Pistolskin filled with autocross
I feel really blessed and blessed 
I am at the pinnacle of my skill
I wish I had a brain
But I'm so drowning in debt
That I think I can buy myself some goldfish

Brush positive on each new try and you wastin metallurgists
Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see
If you want to keep obsessed you can always just flex

Look at all these platinum plaques you have
I am the captain of my class
Hold up, I know I say this, but what I want you — and you know I am true —
I always say NEVER EVER MESSAGE — that you dont even know 
I just cant think of any words that describe me

I mean really, imma donta do this im doin doggie
Cause every single one of my mansions
Is worth a thousand dollars

Big Mac Bleu poses in a Walker receipator
In the background, rappers Lil Peep and cause
Got hordes of new acts every single week
Mess with me more like a G-day

My continuously decaying house scene just got
Disaster zone
 and im already talking millions
 Over email We have already formed a thing where users can work together
Sendin messages almost asynchronously
Bout to mamatanda mga
Gettin unreal
If you want to talk trash, write to me
All these and so forth
Sendin emails almost asynchronously

Bout to tidbitsunf
I should be divorced from yo
Shootin up some chick luther
She really is worth a thousand dollars

Large tracts of exclamation point
Im taking aim
