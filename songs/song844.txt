Film :John Anthony / Intense Gang Violence / Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz
Then I pull up in the rari
With my shooters you'll be sorry


My whip ain't as explosive as you think
My zombie fast Fallin up in the pull up

Lets get this over with, imax and michigan
Live like outsiders, my homeless guy
They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin queues around your home

Don't do drugs, guys sophomore high
Got a lot of them
Making your block look bigger

Redlining in the hood
Better watch what you say cause
Bad trips leaks out in the street

Always keep in mind that new labels

They up in the block
Calling the ceiling red

Stretched it, tried to sum it up
First Try Harman Blista

Brilliant! Used it on me
But it really amuses me that we
This song is not made with sticks
Me and Mac Treblon
Made in the rain with a wooden spoon
Mess with me get it better
Pick up the phone and beat the hell out of you
I'm sorry, but im not your guy

All this information is for entertainment
Speak your mind without sentence
Outrage makes people think other people are bad~~~~~~~

Gear was money like Oswald the leon
Ring Dandy using a metal pipe
Said the feds are crack
Shootin up like a groupie and mytorials

I've had forensics done and found nothing
Imprisoned for four years
Pullin up in a 'rari Sealed
Put my wrist up in the air and its a haters only game
Thats one for a body count
Like safe harbor
All this burglary done at the mailbox
Bonded at ten
Choked to death with a five-gauge
And then had at the police car
Drived myself so much that I wondered where I was
What would happen if I had a little hair

Brat-a-tat wacktat wackt
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ace

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
And then had at the bank
Got all this junk bullioning
I need a life preserver
I need a life bath
Makin dough
 Makin dough like Johnson
So much water im boutta drown
Stillin gonna break
Droppin bombs like Hayes
I need a life use drip
Putz in individual call centers
Xanax and lean (uh)
