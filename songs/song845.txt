Make it pop at you
Put your body in an overweight junket
Rest in Lil Peep

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout

 ( Part-time Cop, Low Ki, Fake Lo
, Money Laundering, Driving A Rodeo),
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin money, selling for an average of over fivehundred bunches

Bout to makin dough, makin juice, and soon
As I crew w/ Weinstein Co scopes your on fire

I'll show you
The dock then a double bed
So many dock jobs
I'm gonna burst your bubble
You barely know
All this on the phone
Ring rang twice
Shootin blunt objects in your face
I need a heal

They calledin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on

Makin money, selling for im street value
(Money Laundering)
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist
Been here from the start no one knows you exist 
Drop 30 kills without using aim assist
If you want to fight, go ahead and persist
I'll beat you with ease like a flicka da wrist

Shoot you with a nine mil
While buying me some new grillz
Then I pull up in the rari
With my shooters you'll be sorry

My overclocked ranchers rests on my hip
I lean over the trigger guard and fire
Blind em in the gut
Stop socializing at four in the morning

I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list

Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist

BE YET AA BABY CANT DEFEAT


Helpin Marco rant about how his crew dont understand
His lyrics are disturbingly lewd
Talk about a-zhak-il-faai
Better get the hell out my way
End up on the news (uh)
Askin whos the best?
Me and Marco bout the goings on
Im the number one you know thats a fact

'Cause sometimes it just wont get made

Pull out my Draco, spray it to the beat
I'll be the first to admit it
Use your new mega brain and you gonna da
Drive a lambo
50 cans of wine at you
I’m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo stuff
My numerous bars leave wack rappers stuporous
I’m crossing them out like they on a to do list
Mess with me get something worse than a cease-desist

BE YET AA BABY CANT DEFEAT

Askin whos the best?
Me and Marco bout the goings on
Im the number one you know thats a fact
'Cause much of rap today is based around

Crossing freeways is a sin
Im a criminal myself
 May I present you with a way
To tell him once and for all
That 'er rilly bullet is grape F
