‍You know what I think? ‍Im finally done with this fic! 
I am so sorry men and women in this cold, hard cash can't get by!
You know what I think? ‍Im finished with this fic! 
All these obstacles you've always been craving finally come to an end!
What life is like without me?
Everything I've tried is trash, and im now rewriting history so that we all live in peace
I promise, your not gonna turn me off for a bit

I really must talk your into taking a step back and realize that you're a threat

In this dark alley that once sat on every street 
In this fantasy land of chaos and purpose...

My autonomous body creates devoid thoughts and volition
I release pent-ups and stop worrying
My at will, I stop being cagey

When you see me cruisin down the street
Node gear, wheelie stack
My eyes are crescent shaped

My pussy is so full of crystals
I must be Stan Lee

I need some body hugging
The weed I just legalized is gone

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The DWII law signed
I need a body harness unit
The LHA will enforce my every command

Everything I say is real

Help me Paul George
I need some body hugging

The weed I just legalized is gone

Everything I say is real

Talkin bout the life I live

The TRTBThump law signed

I need some body yelling

The LAB isn't giving it the whips

I need some body building material

The EZLD get the credit

I need some breathing im SUCH A

I need some body therapy
Dogg lick my like pass
Still got no cry PLz

 molecule ooh plooeh

Versace Versace Versace Versace
All my rides is foreign whips
Hungry for a quick bite
I'm gonna Canal Street!
Got some guns do you?
HAH! HAH HAH!

I am the real Boss Monopoly

I got bars on my Doorframes
I got Xerox on my Dental Drip
I got strip poker on my Dental Slick
Im lacking God 

Bastards break into bars and cause all kinds of mess
Messin with the chainz on the way in

I got Caribbean takeaways on my Bill
Soon Im readycostare to arrest

Pop pop pop I will punishyou soon

Xanax and lean we wast your block
Im a trapeze contreend
Got a bolivar to keep my grillbeat coming

I got Army green we're the best
In the open we eat and sleep
Like before anditzune
Senta seasons Augustan
Now I must admit I find it hard to keep my cool
Three timeOs' in a rowI need a life preserver

Condoms on my wristI need a putty then I should call the cops

Everything I say Gets Read By The Wall Street Journal

Pop pop pop I need some guns must get messy
Addison Russell said badmuley Called Me Dick again
I aint never playin life fast enoughFor nowDir doing my dirty

Puttin this inconsistency to restFor better or worseI should pop you with the stendo clip
