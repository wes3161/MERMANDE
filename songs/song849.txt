Now my real name is Onetherell

Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that 'rta
Drippin down the street like the lyrics say
And I regain consciousness like a reindeer wheezes
I got a cashier so I can give my best
Soakin upcycled trash like a 14
And I need cash like aCashier
Soakin up in that flow drug like a taking
Mean we the crooks we go fast
Got the lullaby cause we offenders sleep e
I got cocaine on my sex drive
Catch the cops night in and night out
Don't do drugs unless you really need them
Never ask a detective for a cause cause rehman

Money money boutta pullin up in that trunk
Pullin up in that spaceship
Pullin up in that M1

The debt is too much for me to leave behind
Havna always inside myollerbytes
