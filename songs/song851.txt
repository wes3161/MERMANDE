I know, I know. We only use cocaine!

Xanax and leanmann
Got them Zeus tanks and crucibles
We the loudest
Most sexual you'll ever find
Leaking Sony cruises by
Bootlegging autotune
Driving a lambo
Giving cocaine to his kids

Yuh yuh

I just bought a yacht
Got the most luxurious helm I've ever seen
My cut is bigger than a heart
Ring ring ten cigarettes
Ring ring ten cigarettes
Don't do drugs (uh)
They'll really mess you up (ooh)
Thats grape Fanta (no pun intended)
They saying fun stuff is fact
Don't do drugs (uh)
They'll really mess you up (yuh)
Thats 20cal(man)re(-), go buy ice
Try to climb the rocket Corona
But you DANGER AT THE LEGISLUTE
 for LOOKING AT UPPER MATER
YOU CAN GET COLD AT THE TOP

For coming here today with a schedule
And seeing that this going on
With so much going on in my head

I almost lost my cool
But hey, at least my calendar is up
Things are pretty much straight ahead
Just know that something is seriously wrong

They calling from far away
What are you doing?
exited as I type this
up until you have to stop and think twice

What a relief to see that comeback on your end
All these restaurant jobs that used to be your dream
Nowadays, I just take this as a good start
Take a moment and think twice before taking a leap

This can only be one trip!

WHAT CAN I DO?
Step out in the open
I really need some disguise
What can you get me for about $200?
leave that to chance
I got so much money I should be a millionaire

Been here from the start and am still, like, not
sethin
 fore
When in doubt, act on it
Take a moment and think
Maybe you should merge
Forget all the other activities
Take a moment and think
Maybe you should lift your gaze

This trip is not over
We still have about a week until we hit the road
Try not to think about it

Until we can find some peace in ourselves

What can you get me for about that same amount?


Take a minute to think about it
Something just isn
Just enough cause
To stack the calorie counts

You're actually taking in too much
What would you do if you had to walk at me

Pull up to you like a friend and ask, 'What am I doing?

What would you do if you had to talk?

I just went on a date - everything went really well
Started on aisles
Then got really, really, romping
I mean it was like a four-course omelette
I was like floppin so I had to crush nepotism

I mean really, really bad
Bout to molly
Guy who calls the kettle up
Prepares myself for a head start
Then I pull up in the rari
The batter is light in the heat
The juices have just poured in
The dull ache in my neck makes me sick
What could possibly go wrong?
Well, at least my rent isnt as bad
Will you live to see the hundred?
So if you have any doubts, consider this
You'll never look like a fool
Comin at your grandparents (uh)
