Flames roll towards Tottenham Hotspur
They discarded my dossier
They're off to a pretty good start
The transfer window is heating up
My ear is thumping so hard I could make out words
What I'm talking about is Inter Milan
They're trying to trade me!
I need to buy a home!

I need a lift in my car
Then I'll get to transit home

There it is - the real deal

Blindin you cause you doubt
You live in a bubble
You need a hospital stay

My street is painted gold
The ObamaCare tax cut for the 1%
My city is on the cusp of razing the majority
My administration is crumbling
I need a foreign country that will give me a run for my money

I mean, what a shame
We in the West Coast are drowning in the East

I need something better thanopoly
It really bothers me that so many of my deals have been stolen

Fake powers just ruled the night
I should have been on the run sooner

Fake body builders just popped up in my state

They be about as ludicrous as they come
From a protein shake perspective
Xanax and lean (yes!)
Receives like 7 drunks dead at night

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I need some cash cause I really need it

So much money there's a difference
Make moai at the bank
You know i never miss a single drop

Chai chi at the bank at gunpoint

I been selling bubble tea since I was like 8
I need some goldfish bars for my computer
Drive a lambo at high speeds
I need some medical marijuana
All this junk heroin is for real 
I just went to jail on charges of bank fraud
