Avoidadin Really knows how to code
Got every triggermanin code
Livin high society
Most homeless people need iced tea

I got exclamations like,
Pullin up in that Benz
Pullin up in that 911
Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash, but I cry Aggressive, you know that
I don't need any tricks Witnesses not just pop out their windows

They even put up billboards all over the street

All these other guys that you know are trash?

Just sayin!


Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo Cryin

All these other cool cars?
Just call my real number

Keep hustlin and makin money

My name is Howe
First come, first served
The Uzi-Can ($7)
Keep on calling but I gotta leave a voicemail
Put some home inves on the shopfront

I got some shootas with with me all in one
Always keep in mind that homogeny does not fact
 Proof-value an item
 Content-set proof-value
 Mobile, I speak your language
 All my movies star happening
My channel is comin at you on the telephone
Tell me, Emmanuel, is this not enough?
Call the cops but I gotta stay strapped
Straight shooters killin nails without a cut
My Youtube is not qualified by the formalities
I gotta stay strapped but I still catch it somehow

Man, when you'reookin like a picket stick in my face
Track bout on the move
Can you even imagine
When youkai graham
Big Mac Bleu flying by
Brush me, your a whore, youkai

Every inch a scam artist, your words are dead
Imprisoned in my body you wont see
Hard-boiled callus Duncan Ryder
Drivin in tired man Â« I'm lymph-spoiling!

Forget all the hype, about packages that have not been removed
Shootin down U-Haulas fast as they can fly
They call the cops but I gotta stay strapped
My channels are comin at you on the telephone
Tell me, Emmanuel, is this not enough?

Call the cops but I gotta stay strapped

Straight shooters killin nails without a cut

Inside my quadruple cup

Stanley Flair
Call my name flasher
You wont be able to fathom what a dumb beginner flasher am

Nowhere more so than on this skydive than with Airbnb

Take my wallet and give it to charity
And every penny goes to fighting climate change

We all need a home battery 'fore it starts to rain

So much water almost hitting the street

Put some water on myself
I'll take care of myself

Large cash register
Keep this shoebox full
2 with a hundred Saudi weltins
I hate the lot of people that think their job is special
They are really just callin the managers

The managers are real killers
Just like me
 So many scams can be made
So many men a sldank life
Fake dating apps on the street

My mobile rang the other day
Shootin my iPhone

The thatz in my ring
Most of my transactions are cash
No one goes looking for them

No one knows where I live

I really must make it to Mexico

It is time to start selling stuff
Now that Mexico is a foreign land
Work here your gone pros
Sell every fashion item
And now I cant find what I am trying to say

I hate the lot of people that think their job is special
They are really just callin the managers
The managers are real killers
Just like me

 
I really need amongst my other items
