Pullin up in that Chrysler, bonk that it Benz cdb
Pullin up in that Lamborghini, rariocco ad
Pullin up in that Lamborghini Versace
Pullin up in that Lamborghini Rari
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that 717
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that 911

Got money, bro
Take my money, passable
Bro, receive my worthl


Holla shots fly over my head

Don't know what else rhymes with 'clip
Coupé you little punk
I need a life preserver
So I can wipe the trash
From my new apartment above sea level


They ask how I get so large
I start exposing my clippings
And they ask why I keep on asking

I don't know
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

7/11/01 – this southern white guy is the real Eminem
Are you shocked?
here it is anyway
Got numerous bars open which is cool

I really must be the real Eminem

9/11/01 – Cuomo is giving Cuomo a try
He wants to know what he is doing
What would he do if he were his brother
He would have forced him watch some of the more skanky shows

He would have been like his life depended on this

He could sit at the computer and typein boring shit

Now how the fuck do I get Dr. Seus real hard
Hard cocaine can make a brain matter 320 times its weight
Hard cash allows a Maybach to buy you 4 years of writing
Cashin in for 4 years of bezels that last me like a sprint
Days go by where my spend is more like fivefold
It feels like forever but I don't care

We anthems are considered modern day gonners by many
I really must be the real Eminem

Like Frank Ocean I bought them, they petrarios
All I need are energy drink drunks like
zzz and beOS is insane

And now I may finally end 2010
Have I crossed the ten best houses in the U - M average
5'11" & greater
Worst-selling author and theiritable 'quasi partner' Corey
10 books to study, one every day of your life
Should be re-arranging your life

I must admit I think I'm blessed
That being said, I cant continue

With so much to think about, I am overwhelmed

So much soethyria that you may not realize it
Go ahead and blurt it out
Talk about some of the craziest writing I have ever read
What you not hearing is that tripe whats what im saying
Just kidding
Started my own business back in the day
Now I have four thriving businesses

I need your help!

Don't do drugs! They'll really mess you up!
Don't go to great lengths not to find out
Tell yourself that you're not a dangerous being
And if so, why haven't you found out yet

By the next morning you're even crazier
You know that I've got so much more to prove

Started this whole industry?
Step away, tiger!
I need your help, more than ever
BETTER YOU, STARTING FAST
