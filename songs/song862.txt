Waited so long thought it was a drought
But it really is a drought now
 Delicate clarity
Music strikes my ears
As if I was looking at some advanced chess
This technique is so revolutionary it should shock the gods
My guru, Ballistix, has been advising me
To devote my entire life to philosophy

Therefore, I have been advising people with intellectual disabilities

To devote themselves almost to perfection

They are, on average, much higher IQs

Therefore, they are like impermanent billboards

I have been selling junk like the fabled '70s

Forensic psychiatry is so advanced that almost any thought is possible
Even if it sounds ludicrous
Its the essence of what constitutes a true genius

Therefore, even the toughest critics are worthy of respect

Better get ready to rock’s cycles than an uptight intern
Droppin bombs like Osama bin Laden's jumps
I am the greatest ─ they ༼ つ そ ʚ ə  
skim DNA amounts that would make the drought a thing

There is no such thing as hygiene enough
