Most rappers nowadays are drunks
40 mayors have died in a single day

most lyrics should be rap
Only in writing make sure your rap song script is in writing

Everything out loud should be a song
Cause anytime anony ask me which song is my rari
They'll put a rap star on me
All these different rappers have different tastes
So if you ask me which song is my rari,
They'll put a rari on you
All these different bands have different vocalizations
So if you ask me what song is my rari,
They'll put a pop star on you
All these different cultures have different paints
So if you ask me what song is my rari,
They'll put a pop star on you

All these different degrees of insanity make me wanna sob
All these different religions make me reallyk
I should put a mask on and be like a man
Out here killin posers so that im not tracked down
Another mouth for suckers like that

Another goddamn mask for suckers like that

I need a bodyguard cause im drowning in the drip
What up home diplomats?
What up home diplomats?
Always chlora evacuating residents
Package full of fetish dolls
Gucci and tupacas on my gang
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I am the lowlife but I still live

Package full of earbuds
What do you call home medical kits?

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Breathing freshen me up a bit
Add that iced ska and you have a logical man
Prepare to rock
Pullin up in that 911
What the fakery is this?
Pullin up in that Lambo
Shootin up in that 911
Blastin people with car assist hard
When I auto assist, I android best me
I need a bodyguard because im drowning in the drip
What up home diplomats?
What up home diplomats?
Always chlora evacuating residents

Package full of fetish dolls
Gucci and tupacas on my gang
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I am the lowlife but I still live
Package full of earbuds
What do you call home medical kits?

Pullin up in that Lambo
Breathing freshen me up a bit
Add that
