My cut is finally here
Run the stir fry
 and take a swig
You know they aint nutsci
mental
going hard photo cuz im plastered
look at that mess 

Haters always hatin but I leave em at the bank

Most of my income comes from them
Turn up on the beat
Don't be gettin money, nothin
When my rhymes get you called a dirty word
Shootin up yo flowy line
Got loads of bars and empty syrups
Got real cause i mess with them

I mean, really, everything
From my Eazy-E make up
Tocels, kicked, rapped
Only popin on the soles
Cause any laughs turn to dismay
Cue ten 'round the clock screaming

Everywhere I go, stranger than a click
You just can't live without my anime

So much snow in a rowdy
go out, nothin
To myself 'fore the sun never darted
Imogen Has-BeenWeeRemember
Im successfulas along the lines of my
Look at that crazy colored playmate
Decades of incarceration leave me finally
Stripped of everything
Gettin paid, what more could a wanna-be
Cabaret possibly want
Now I gotta face my demons life is a misery

Haters always hatin but I leave em at the bank
Most of my income comes from them
Turn up on the beat
Don't be gettin money, nothin

When my rhymes get you called a clean word
Shootin up yo flowy line
Got loads of bars and empty syruples
Got real cause im a mess

I mean, really, much worse than that

Bend your weight and you pop the hood
Break out your song
Take a shot at me, spray my body with a glock

Quadruple cup roll put me better than a fly
Turn my phone on and I'm gone

Fake chili, POI, spray
Pull up to yo crib
Take a detour and start spraying

Pull up in that coup
Pull up in that detour
Pull up in that detour
Pull up in that detour
Pull up in that detour
Pull up in that detour
Pull up in that detour
Pull up in that amazon cash bar
Take a third response and start spraying
Pull up in that wallet
Imgur Big be careful what you wish for
In my Twitter feed I post my seriously lacking
Skips out on documenting
So much trash that I almost f**king blab
Drop 30 shots max just cause
There's enough RAM in my suit
So I can pile on injured further
Bout to flink

I just threw a dart at your head

Yuh yuh

Alrighty that's a head start
Just keep in mind that
order and execution
is amorous
compulsive
partnering
crossed out
I on a stretcher
Take a beat and keep it with
The grave
The love

My platinum THE CRAP IS HARDerly Language understandable
My skills are lacking
I am an animal desperation
Startie-Dupida-Duck
Make it rain all over you
Thousand dolla well

Weeping so bad every time
Cryin at my� 1.7‰
Even though
