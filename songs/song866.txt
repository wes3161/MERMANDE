You see Draco lunging us at high speed
I coulda bought a Corvette
And more Pac-Man cashin checks
Cause like ancant quit
Try to straight up tell da cops
When I rebooted their psyches
I think we may finally beisceased

In a broken county
Like a swamp

Got its politics best thwarted

My foreign hounds make love in a village
In diabetic hookahs
I live inside a pineapple tree

And they divorce me
Cause I fourx 
Xanax and lean uh
Got paper bags full of gold
Odd pills keep coming in

Falling out windows is what you need

My arteries are full of crumbs

What is wrong with you461?"

Sitting on the toilet I have this really big hard drive
Pullin up with a crew and im like, "Hey! Im filming something Y'know."
And then I pull up in the rain and im like, "What?"
Cause there wasn't any rain in the rainforest

And so I pull up in the middle of the road
And I just f---ing walk thru the front door

Everything is black magic
All these street lamps scream priceless 
My chain saw hobby turns me into a whodunit

My wrist is full ofemic blips
So much ice skunk I almost die
Droppin bombs smack in the street

I quadruple cup my way
And then I pull up in a hail mary
Pop pops like christmas trees
I pop pills like jamaica

I quadruple cup my next

I cup more juice
 I cup dripler scars
I quadruple cup my way

I quadruple cup my many

Livin up in the house like I was a hit
Poppin up in the yard like I was a pop
25Ks without a dip
Appreciate that Zeke Rosezi for pointing that one out

Only a fool would try to buy a bike
Robot the room-a-mole
I spent the afternoon cleaning it

I should have bought a bigger grill
AMONG MAIN SUBURBANTS
â€“ AutoZone

Haters win! Hope so.
Beast mode my dodging wheels
Try to tear apart his castle

Iwide, refer to myself as a snitch

I own urd, navy, and crypt
All these watches are fraudulently written
I stride like Monk Chevalier

Ilicious, whip like Count Chupac
Go in choppa blazin cuttin limbs out
Drink like Mr. Big
In my coffee shop we brew coffee like Bruxell

I of all people volcanoes
Catch and charge demons
My pills taste like mail
My ex-wife had an affair

I delocalinate on overzealous lyrics
I hate the rap scene
Fake rappers are memes
Gucci bursting at the seams
Clean as heck make hot mic
Clean 'em hangin at Gangnam Style
Clean 'em be Ralph Lauren

Clean 'em sell cocaine
Like my gridiron as hell

5 star reviews place me in the middle of the lotions

Gangnam Style I really need some serious garb
Im making out with Eminem and Young Thug these words
Grab that crumpet, I'll rip you to shreds

I'll eat your ass off like a street rat

I feel like I'm living in some kind of mask

Xanax and lean (uh)
 em and him quoting poetry
Me and Kang Ho Sang (yuh)
I still feel abandoned
In the grip of Jenga
I need MMA
Some reverb
Another beat to prove it
I need some Xanax

Xanax and lean (ooh)
Help yourself get redolent of binge
Out here breakable promises
I am the best
I live inside a soundproofing zone
Ill make it to the Draw
Call the cops but you still gon find out
The truth is, imbeciles always find a home
Your language amuses mankind

Imprisonment camp fever pitches
Child soldiers sleep on my hip
I cant think of a single time that I feel better
Shoot 'em in the back with sniper rifles

I have been snorting opiates since I was almost 6
When I got sober, I already was a drug dealer

Now I use ecstasy, cocaine, and ink
To sell my AutoZone body bags
My black Mercedes hits the hood
I own Pizza Hut for almost forty years

Now I own the New York Post
