What would you say were funny songs about

And for that matter, if you want to fight, go ahead and persist
You know that life is cruel and numerous
So you're always developing resistance

So even if you feel supported, you'll always get essentially wiped out
Wanna try and find some peace in yourself?
Call me "The Drug Miser" or "The Kidnapper"
But really, what do you call the street like?
Money gripe make me sick twice over
I started this company to build my success
