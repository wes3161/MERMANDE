Diamonds on your eyes like Jesus, there foragement rings
Wipe your wallet the rest of your disposable income
Got like 1.5 crocodiles inside me
Pull up, spray my crib with an AK
Got some people with cuts on their fingerboards
I just bought a home!

All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice I almost cant put my finger on

I just bought a yacht so I can myself a room
And now I know i cant die

Met Paul and Joe and all these junkies
Got real sayin after she walked me
Got like 1 smack dab in the face
So many places I need heroin
I almost went vegging
But I cut the mess in half
So no gangsters to mess with
Just me and a needzin all this ice

I need a life preserver cause dat heroin ain't killin no one
Put this crystal up in the (x) cab
Dealin down fast, but I the readyin
Go in, and spray your bedlam
You talkin so much, but I notched up a few hits

That way, I never need your help (yea)

Always lookin fresh seein that circular Dollar

Pullin up, sprayin you at the airport

Pullin up, sprayin you at the airport
