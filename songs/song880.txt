False titles keep you on the go
Help an inmate escape
When an execution seems inevitable
You must first locate the killer
Control presence the chain sullens
Paralyzing your every step
Getting you to lower your voice
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
Four finger deadpan seriousness
Tap water off my back
As I get high I find that I pop
Another time quite a ways from the finish line

Still make it to the halfway mark

I must be in the top 5%
