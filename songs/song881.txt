Music defines my taste, some nights I even dance
Poppin molly, loaded with heroin, ready to rock

Thousandfoldyson rigging a truck in front of my house
Pull up, spray the floor with top half an airstrike team

Covered in red and platinum bestowing life ... on my head

Imperial Spy cap on my asshole (ink)

Gold Bangle pad on my clique (yuh)

The EH-6 Thunderbolt droid on my person (yuh)
Dino good riddance every day
We the Mod Squad pull down the trigger on the revolution (yuh)

Imperial air support base coming in (yuh)

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like ian based
Got them beyblade hung on my hip
Imperial everything upside down
I need some personal finance
