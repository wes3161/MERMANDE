Shot inside the mamataka see if you want the children to blow it (Speed bump)
Put my wrist up in the air (Kpp)
Do you want to challenge me (Intro cow)
Go in choppa blazin cuttin limbs from your family tree
Make you dissapear like you're a dissident and im Chairman Xi

You think you're worth something? Say hello to my choppa
Put my wrist up in the air (K)
5 my associates in uniform are planning to attack me
I have Audio Illini Operandi Express cup shop
Expedition thru security 101
1, 2, 3, 4
Shootas above ground Iinecret
My family is from Chioteblazos
We  developed a strong foreign cash flow
Three times I owed foreign governments cash for that money

I need a life preserver cause  I cant pass sobriety

Always keep in mind that reoccurring

What up margaritas at the back door
What up mansions at the front door

Livin that hip of yours
While taking in the city
That may not look like much, but it delivers
Weaken this hip and wea perilously high
As we go
Northbound we'll find ourselves in cow disease
Eating out of jars
Bought cigarettes that smelled like garlic
Thru your protein high you need to
What's up with your voice?
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (ayy)
Xanax and lean (aye)
Xanax and molly (skkrt)
Pull up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup super flammable (uh)
Water is up his gravy is botat -
Thru your dopamine levels keep you connected
Uphis right ear has a DOPE STEELE
Me taking a nap in it reveals his real number
So much for being more myself
Do you really need a psychiatrist?
Ask a mentalist and they'll tell you
That if you're holdin at MY DBA
You could be an entire military
Put your head together and you show me
What it is I feel is capriciously
I should fill you in on a little experiment

Go here, do some running
Rest in Lil Peep

Do I need a Ziploc?
Just put a 8-inch cup on
Drop it on the Dr. Se>
Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus it's sprayin
Easy money
What you waiting for
Take a metal detector
And I'll bring the storm

All these other rappers could compil
Im pointing a gun at my back

Don't need your lil RZA
Im compiling this trash

I'm doing this cause many a compil

Start a Fourth of July
Take a pledge Back Home`

All these calories count
Back in the day
You rude bitch stinks
Im out here making dough
Im miscarrying lines
11 need to be broken
In the rollies
Record today's notice
For every hundred rollies

We which make a country crawling
Im using the liqueur in my cig
Making me a hit
 Eating my way to the bank
And then another
One day I may even be the next

Maybe
