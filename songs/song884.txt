Do you think you're an investment and should buy what you can get already?
Perhaps you should put some money into real estate and sell it for a much larger profit?
What if you could get all this new inventory you just bought but you still need to sell it for an even bigger profit?
You know how it is, actually

I am almost certain that you are not mistaken

And each slice of pizza is different
Better monitoring for rip-offs
Take a risk and keep it
Large corporations are tough
