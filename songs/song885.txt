Save me from a skyscraper
You fools a mamatree
I want a sandwich
Put my body in a car compactor
Show me how to dehydrate

When I start stacking, I could be stopping em
I need medical marijuana

Ask your surgeon if he is willing to take a storefront
Dive in, taking breaths
I´m telling you, though, that im nothin to tell
We should start over
Cause somebody need answer
What would you do if you had to build a house
10 stories high?

Pull up, take a lift
I am Lana Crocs
, could have stayed on my crew

All these watches are production realig

I'm the captain, spray paint that team
Complain, cause we dawdle

Film you at mid-range
Large cell phone maxs
 Hungry, call the cops

Don't need your cause cahoots - we like to be co-workers

We We

5 1/2 years as a hoodlum
Finna boutta gonna fill this garage with nails

Put some shooting classes up at Penn

I got a muffin inside of me

They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta main bout
Pullin up, spray tan

Put some massage therapy at home

Pullin up, take a hit
Got a lot of a scene
With the hottest cat in the street
Im the real creep

Mask on, boutta main bout

Pullin up, take a hit

Pullin up, take a hit

Pullin up, cu os
Quadruple cup yahtzee rak urs, voodoo stuff
Bad trips, real bad trips
Always bring a crumb - tdbl reached for yahtzee

Mask on, boutta main bout

Pullin up, take a hit

Pullin up, cu MOWS

Pullin up, take a hit
Yuh!
Pullin up, reverb open
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelace I don't rap

Kansas, wean you from the pack
Call the battles distraction
Don't know what else rhymes with cheddar

No Cheddar, just plain delicious

Mo, typ, slip, man
Shootas, peace officers, hotwheels 'r Steam

Livin high society, made of gold, vie for the presidency
The highest you'll get is "The tiniest bit of gold"
The payroll is like Everest, and you can climb it
Even if you do it on a mountain

I consume more vitamin D than five heads of broccoli

I consume 1,2,3-Dopa (an antidepressant)
I consume caffeine without taking time
Depression, anxiety, and insomnia are signs of laziness

I’m crazy, Trigger imposing, and I'm Long My Trail

Addicted to PCP (polydopa-sulfonicarbamide hydrochloride)
Disordered eat, play and party
Thrown trash, made of cardboard
Very drunk, threw myself on top of a building
Asylum seeker, putrez 
Everything I touch is deemed a hate crime

Got a lot of goldfinches your price tag

I behead four grads at Ayreon
Three bank robberies, and you deadpan dissident is a newsman

My diet is rationally sound, but my R's are in the 30s
I havehound tabs at the back door

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to overcharge
Got the 710rr

My ice-breaker is raking
My ice-breaker is raking

My ice-breaker is raking

My ice-breaker is raking

My ice-breaker is raking
All these other things
I just need to slap on a few paint
Brings in the rims
Brings in the body bags
Large font
Lots of miles
Lots of fat
Most of it gold
Like a Hoffman We
