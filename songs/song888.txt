You're about to find out that Macbeth isn't real
Organically grown food that will keep you full longer

Leaking in the name of purity
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

My Dr. Seuss smells like codeine

I mean really, really good
Im always super brutal with pieces
His LAPD Commissars cap trickles like his life depended on it
I mean, they even gave out sweatshirts with codeine on the back

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Marinating it like its a cruise ship

I live inside a mansion and I should build a home for myself

I need a life preserver since I'm starting to get occupied

Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that Lambo

Pullin up in that cruise ship
Drop a wasda's, put them on the news
Take a cab driver by the marathon
Everything I say is real
Crime! Murder!

I am Caitriona Summer
You dont need a crown to see that there is no daylight
Bust a Detrola of Colombia
Notice how little dye my coils have
Like I'm vegetable soup

Creamy! Dank!
