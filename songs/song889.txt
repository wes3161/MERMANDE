This hair was made in the Mexico

I bought it at a Mexican drug gang

They gave it to me
Trashed it, put the cost down

They calltrashed it my body
Makin dough

Pretty much every day
Makin dough here (yuh)
7 yd of fast food
Got the best meal of your life

Dumped my cash in the sky
Run the centipede
Got the sandwich

Got the murder switch
Pull up, spray the coke

Inside I.QI. questionable
DisgustIN'-ridden(uh)
[Matrixification]
’’
Ill put you in more pain than a prison cell
All my crimes are conscious acts
You arrogant filthRedditor’’’’
’’
Oral hygiene stuff coming soon
Depression attack the internets
Thousand-fold webbed
Talking smack with another utopian
When my wife says 'harassment', I just say no
After that, my peace process with you have been painful

Endured questioning your worth with conflicting evidence

My demons lurk in the unconscious (yah)
My sleep cycles impeding my analytical faculties (woah)
My concentration loss spurring my thought processes (yuh)

I'm so different-looking-at-you-killas
You think you're special?
Give yourself over to mindfulness
Try to imagine a different future
Where your worth is greater than my
Expectations of personal success rise

You can achieve so much without cultivating your mindfulness
That you may even believe them true

You must be super curious to meet Rila
When she finally appears on your watch
First you first have to find her
Gonna have to spend the night with the Attic
If you want to survive you gotta find her and find her. Suck it. (endless)
