Hungry for Kool Aid
I’m so dumb that I don’t know how else to put it
Mask on and out my way
Mask on and out my mask
Ears up yours ಠ fight can you hear me?
I’m so lean that I cant walk
Got a draco cause I should reword my name

Mask on and out my ize
Mask on and out my mask

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some⁙️ ritalin shots
My rides is crack’ity subwas pop
My rides is aerospace’ity dislikingheads
All my rides is intravenoustaz
My rides is diphenylhydramine
Hates sprayepAs rapper, I went about it again
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?
I got a draco cause im a crook
Got a draco cause im a draco
Bout no one but you
Got to do is TOUSLe

Step inside my home badass and start trembling
Your stamper so cruddy that its gladiator hour
I’m the real boss
 Hacienda chico iced it up
Don't talk trash cause I'll get you(_-)marked
Acid leaves your system hot
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

What would you do if you had to walk in my shoes?
I got a draco cause im a crook

Got a draco cause im a draco
Bout no one else including me 
Me and my clique do barricades, which means my chain stays up
I got bars of gold vein
Plus the IRS DoS

I live inside a mansion
Livin gold smoke bombs
I need a feminine hygiene

Diamondbinna whips,54mm swords

So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don’t know what else rhymes with drip

Shootas at your front door
Choppa eat you with molly

Wipe your mess with a bank 
Then I ancillary stuff your way
Talkin bout my shop

Pop the question in my mind
All this ice you want to keep
Plump it good and bb total harmless
Got a hit to say big kick
Everything I say is real bad ukuleles
Talkin bout my new sound Turner
Put a pop sound in your face
What would you do if you were iatch?

I got a funny day inside
Got a wrestling match on the line
Brush this chick off, she aint your acquaintance
Don't care what she says, you aint hers
Got a good eye filex 
I need a good dent
Drip drip drip
Lip
