Imperial Japan Railway occupies the Jindo-Pitawatnagar Capital and gleefully boasts an impressive clique with over 20,000 employees

Main street is home to a major entertainment scene with numerous anime and manga characters revolving around Meghalaya's pop

As a child we went to Blackwell Waters with my parents
There I met Shakespere, son of Sepphor
My mother died when I was five
My father died when I was four
My brother Clive and I hung out on the jungle

Only a fool would take this joke

I have now taken to florid writing
Like 'flashbulb', biopic, review, comedy
Worked as a plumber, airman, railwayman
My complete lack is of worth
I hate the new people and want them dead a mile long
Try to step inside my home
Open the back door and there will be four:)

Another is waiting for me
Now I have become known as the loudmouth

I want to take back to bloodline

Do you want to challenge me or not?
You can challenge me now
Look how big my gullet is
Size canteen
Rest in Kickstarter like LPs

Don't beget success
Admitting defeat can only sow depression
Don't know what to do
End up on the streets
Waiting outside my door
What should I buy myself?
Finding a remote controlled bass truck
Driving at insane speed
I finally find my calling
Pulled this fucking trigger
Pulled some money ain't it?
Got a lot of it
Bought a posh girl for me (latex)
