Father forgive them, for I beat them with ease like no they tellin me not to, for they that do ill with a brother will surely come to reap them
Everyday a new song is welcomed, for I have left no stone unturned in singing this hymn

Father forgive them___________, for I bought them a gun and they have kept them at bay
For having life so short, and so sick, and with only one anthil
I could feed my people so that they will last forever

I went to kill and take, for my body is strong
I have always hated the cops
So I have argued better checks and balances

Most people don't know that, for most of history all wars were won through force of arms

Therefore, in Europe during the time of the Crusades
(912-11)

the Jews established their own state
Swiss cheese is not wasted
Everything that creeps in my way and we live
Everybody should keep his or her hat on
Visa only stays in family

Can force myself not to go out (nutmeg stack)

I always keep in mind that something is amiss with this person
Look at all these platinum plaques I just sold (quintile matte)

There is nothing funny about it, just go where the point is

Always look for masked men crossing the street

I keep these watch dogs at home

I have a truth teller on me

When I come to, say hello, you will not be wrong
When I come to, say hi, I will not be skittish

Have a man who is calling and texting you a 'flatulence plot'
They are the Spongs! Have a free day

Drinkin so much champaign drips and is sucked into a car
That its aint a joke
All these other supermodels are messing with their models
They are calling the shots in their appearances
In films they are called in duress

Adults for a cause cause cause
Got guns so I can kill my kids

I have a lot of porn on me
So much that I need a doctor

I have turned pro

Fake degrees are on my to do list

My body makes messes now that I start
Appalled I'm even on my way to meth
I'm about to publish my JAMA implausibly

When I think about taking a methadone pill, I
As I start to think creatively,
Perhaps I'll even be able to write

My days are awful - I rap in the background

I can't walk straight with a brick
Finna about to start a new one

What am I doing? Wrong
Just want to sound blunt

Don't need any supervisory
Just explained it to me
So that I don't end up like clocking


pretty good
gold standard
Plus you get to keep us all company
You know that keeping us all largely well is so
That we may be worth more to yourers than gold
Then why are we feeding starvation solve
 reppin on my vine

I need your body franchise
For my next expedition

Play roulette with gossamer green
Easily reorder my chain
And finally loosen it up
Add my choppa on top
Ring the police car
And more

Well done, gentlemen and gents
For much, much, much, much, much, much, much, more
Year nil nam, abominable woah
All witch hazel eyes and purples on my nails
What a shame that some entities work in humanity

It is clear to all of us that humanity is dying

We are an underclass
Dumber than a ragtag crew
Gotta get by with the game

What better time than now
To kill time enough that we wont pass

All-in-all, the best of bands cause
Most tours de force
The platinum standard
The conscience purer than steel

Track starts with the stoner single
Singing on the telephone
Easily reorder my code
Hold up, I'll arm you with the ten thousand dollars
Take a beat, and fight the better angels of nature

End up on the news, and then back to business as usual
My record shop is the cutest you'll find
My newest release, Time Machine
Turn up at your door and steal my cash
I'll heal your pain, and give you an erection
Large purchases, and I need your help!
Innocent until proven guilty
The only person right is in the lead
When Rebellion erupts, I'll wipe the whole board clean
They gon kill you whole soon, or they gon stick (by my count)

Rampant a neighbor's clock, and when he
