So much ice you just have to spend a fortune
To work, we dance where we like
With my metal junkets, I can sing
Like Franklins on top
Turn my day
Night vision can see the future

Don't know what else rhymes with 'til it hurts
So much ice you just have to spend a fortune

To be a doctor you need to fiddle
You better hope your plumber is not a prick
You better hope your postal worker is not a clerk

Even if you're not sure
You better hope your delivery girl is a

I need a rest and a personal renaissance

Abusive, homophobic, xenophobic, and (false)
All these negative words people tell themselves
They'll get over it if they keep talking

I mean really, these negative words?
You know they everywhere?
everyday just another day
To myself I feel more at ease
While more people respect me

Most days though I just feel really alone

I mean, uh, you know, I think of you a lot already
And every day for the better part of an hour
I just feel more at ease
Like I really am
And you know that already
Just think of all the things you were just hiding

For everything you were said before
Now you know why
So that you may find out why
What you are really asking is a great get-out-of-jail-free card
Try it, and you will see why I threw myself at the challenge

For now, at least, I feel much better
Like I really am
To say that I am devoid of all these great causes would be a massive understatement

Therefore, I should stress that I am not a minor
While doing my best, and calling all the shots,

I am still the best I can be

Droppin bombs like AK-47s
Waited so long thought
