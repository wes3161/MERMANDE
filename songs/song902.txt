He died a wet dream and now I rot in hell

I got jobs at Starbucks and your not supposed to live

Stay inside Dodge Trots, starve congress and call the shots

I'm the best you can hope for, and I'm wearing purple now

You ain't gon live to see 40, and I gon slam the sushi counter
But I am here to stay, and I'm killing it every day
You know that missile never misses? DontBoutBLK His codes are MONEY (raqaaay)
