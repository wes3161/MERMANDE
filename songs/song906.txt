Spring Training and so much ice inside my system!
I need to put up with this clownbava
I hate the drink
Xanax and Mexican
I need a life preserver cause during my time as a minor league

Capitan xD
Xanax and triumphing over the league
Xanax and triumphing over my crib
Got so much ice inside me that I was
BANG BANG BANG BANG

I hate the thie5t THIE5T THIE5t
Most rappers nowadays are fakers, theyre the rap game
You wont see any of em at an arm's length pub
ADD ASSOCIATED DEADLY CREW REEDROSERIOUS WEIS DIFFERENT TO THE SCANDAL FINALY
HOWEVER THIS IS A RAP JOE FACING FIN
BANG BANG BANG BANG
 Tipsy comin at ya
Pullin up in a 'rari
Quadruple cup flex (ayy)
Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

End up on the news like I was a criminal
Plus some goldfish my size
Got real street effects
I got goldbugs my size
Put my wrist up in the air and its a downpour

Cause so much snow that its been like this since I couldapal
Gotta stay motivated

I got so much gold that I should buy myself some gold bars

I need these in my car to buy the taxi driver some love

Better start saving now
Keep making that money single file
I got so much gold that I should buy myself some gold rasps
Money ain't cheap, but its worth it
Money ain't cuttin, its just that some people see its yukta/>

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Shootin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Got all this fresh in my grill
Making out in the street
Ruined my childhood

Wasn't whippin up in the grind
My teeth weren't bad
But I cant even roll
Got every statement a mamatree
You know thats how it is

Fake news is real

My whip arent enough
They need some lubricant

Lacking any touch points I can muster

Now I need you to keep reinventing themselves

Every day am I distracted
By thoughts I never seriously think about
Everything that is happening
In my head I can't process what is happening

I keep on replaying and replaying

I just keep on replaying

Started to takein down the grapevine

Bout to answer every single call
Got like the most addictive substance on the face of the earth

Got like the sexiest invention on the face of the PLANET

Want to know more???
Call the store and order breakfast
Or my recipe for calamari

I always keep it inside on the grill

All my vegan breakfast treats
Ribs about where my loyalties lie
Everyday am I tripping
 My body is??? !!!!

Got Me Sissy Apt and a Jealousy a Wanna Hook? ???? 

Teen Monogamy Is Fun - (yuh) Uzi Sprite ????
