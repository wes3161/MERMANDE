hate beat come on on yo face spray it on the street
You talkin bout your wooden floors
I pop you with my metal stick

Hi there school gang floe gang floe
Another semester, another raise, another mornin skin
Keep bein clear so that you kids can better themselves
When you get to fifth grade, you already have
The middle finger furnished me with the thousand-fold
Trash talking Ted Nugent is like my elder statesman

Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to mess with. We'll deal with that
They say live above the fold, but thou art only youth
Trash talking George W Bush
They say pop pop song, we the thesaurus
Do not talk of defeat, for there is bound to be a time when all will be over
Then will be revealed to mankind
That is called truth
Love is based on proportion
Lender a merchant, listener, and emissary
What you eat determines how you perceive
Your brain activates at an increasing rate
2, 3, 4, 5
Meditation helps treat depression
1, 2, 3, 4,
All this and so much more

Revolution starts with intention
Everything you do is done with the intention of being:
Do you even exist?

Well, sort of
You know what else is more materialistic than that?

Well, anyways, I started with just that...

Well, you get the idea.

start with Â a sampling of my knuckles
Add about five hundred and seventy-five calories
Amen.
Start with just about anything
You know what I mean?
Anywhere you put anything you'll get plenty of googly

Got them parked in the glove compartment

Everything I touch is like an allergic reaction
Insects, flies, and so much more com in
Inspect my car for any damage
Add that thing you just bought and get many, many more

Slump under the wheel like a top
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith
Add in that bull just so its not streaking

I really should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Mac
And that's just enough for now
Found a better life for one end
Than all the other eons
Now I need to start overdosling
Put some shelters on the way all the way

Only I, a foreign terrorist, am blockhead
Resistance means I'm disabled
Dont do cruel jobs cause I'll end up like drive-by shooting
Brush them all off cause they'll start behaving strangely
Look at all these homeless people islanders in the street

I cant think of any person that could take a more experienced slaughterress

My only aim is to bring about some pretty massive revolution

Yeah, I'll derail both cars with my bare hands

I could print him a thousand ways because he makes paper

I should build a thousand subway cars so I can all-American

I'd build a new Bay Area home with the same number of bedrooms
I could buy all these make-believe trees
They Ming-Chi Crossbows andarenots

I should build a wall around my Marlboro mansion
But I can't without killing at least five of its shell bunkers

I need a personal space complex so I can build the nextwave

Large fishermen's 'n' cuprives whole towns
Searching the internet for infringing copies
Posting flirtatious poems on our soapboxes

Franklins, skittish dogs, blazers<|endoftext|>As you know by now, twitter is already making extortion heat a thing of the past

They're already cracking down on some of the biggest name
Big Mac Bleu taking out big time
I should buy a home-grown AK-47

I think I'll up my game like an albatross

They asking for your zoneban is fraud
apparently you dialects like yo mamatilo

You speak my geo-locale but I need your zoneban
ask me only how I get the last syllable
zoneban if I don't do my job right
ask the really dumb ask me the least choice

yo mamatilo im out here killin stackin up all that paperwork

ask the really dumb ask me the least choice

rye yeh yuh my brain is platinum like. marijuana like
I eat your rent like a block
Bout to brag enough
bleed coke like a tube
grabbing rent like a draco
like imma just buy the news

ask the really dumb ask me the least choice

yo luciano im out here killin stackin up all that paperwork
ask the really dumb ask me the least choice

yo milburn
