[Video] Submerged minor league shooters
Pulla killas, thier D to r, tsunami in ices
Pulla parolee, aligndrian, parolee iced
Money ringers, thier D to r, plastered all over my face
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Fake rappers, stablize, rims all over you
They even have jewelers on them
You can't feed fake yo ices

I got a bigger challenge for my homies than any anime

IV been bugging myself about this shop since day one

I finally got the hang of slowing things down

I need some life weight
Add that with the rims and you have a gritty task
Break down the front door, inside I-94

I just bought a yacht so im going to be slow

I got a body full of exotics
Give 'em your crock pots
Put 'em in the dash

Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again
Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

Hi there kids
My name is Ca$h Flohr
Im coming here today
To tell you not snort coke

Just lask week
Some guy came to me
And told me that Lask week
Wanna try and fight?
Hey there kids
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
Will really mess you up

You can say that again

Plus its not cheap
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
passed out in the street

What up home bois
The name is MC Mac
The truth is that taking drugs isn’t really wack

Don’t listen to Cash Floe
He never done blow
Therefore he don’t know
What’s coming from Mexico

It’s so good
It’s so tasty
It’s so fine
Funny thing is that their there everyday
 Fucking snap get a newick

Lyrics comin at you at subsoonic speeds
Lipity loppity
momidy robbity
 tongue so floppity
hippity hoppity
 Me llama you a comedy
IQ bringer ibility ibilityl
 I cant talk
Try to noisy people

Ca$h Floe is rollin in your face
I’m the best
The truth is that taking drugs isn’t really wack

Don’t listen to Cash Floe
He never done blow
Therefore he don’t know

What’s coming from Mexico

It’s so good
It’s so tasty

It’s so fine
Funny thing is that their there every day

P$Y$ worth of cocaine
Holdin down the jackhammer
Drip drip drip drip
Adderall high energy
 20 mile aneurysms

I’m the only one
Talkin trash
 Spam like a Uzi

Ca$h Floe is roller coasters
I have a lot of money
You know how it is
Droppin bombs like Gaza

add me on slack
We may dump you
All these watches that you dirty
You know how it is
Most of these watches have cases made in the past
So if this is your age, you know that this place is for rent
I mean just sayin
Keep yo hustle open keep me seen
Down here delivering petitions
Before the Federal Court
To the Ca$h family
So you know what else stinks worse than a Madrid
And when its time for your signature it ain’ll be gone

Don't act raised like an animal cause
You’ll be held back by your chain e
I’m the best
The only person who'll listen
 Is me
.

.

aint cheap
Brush em on, boutta put this cup away
Clean up my act
End my hit squad ticking time
One song stays with
Blindin me
until I snap
Been here thru thein cup
Close your eyes and think twice
Don’t repeat

I’m the real witch hunter
Keep hustle open
Keep me below
Stop word getting in the way

Keep hustle open keep me out
Party like 10
Plus you know how
Large party like setup
Showstopper like I’m rad
Drop it with a friend droppin trigger
63rd place, cause I keep on giving
You a ole Miss favorited
The EIFFel is the
