Shipping the dead weight of your brain
To yourself
As someone who goes out
Slick
Disrespectful
Don't do drugs
Rest in Lil Peep

Heroin is out of stock
you can get that for about the net cost
Get 'er riying
'Cause I cant ship tequila
To myself
I cant eat
'Cause I cant eat (ody) Disease
I cant think straight
Shoulder up comedy
CauseI cant take a step
Step down
(charpton)
Finna tequila
To myself
I take a pill
What is the matter?
What is the matter?
What is the matter?
What is the matter?
Thats enough pop for me
Take a whack at my door

Pop inside my crib
It messin up the sound
All my songs loop
All my lyrics be crooning
All these 4-course bites fling you
And you aint grown on me
Shootin up pizza, makin money

I mean, really, really wanna talk

Take a whack at my door
Throw it all in the trash can
Put it on your to-do list

This a fight, paint me with tide (ayy)

Help me vitamin D clear (help)

I need calcium, so I gotta give it a shot (ayy)

Add that zest to ye milk and I'm wack (ayy)

I need vitamin D, so I gotta give it a shot (ayy)

Got a scoop full of pills
Got a double dose of rhythm (ayy)
Got a double dose of dopamine (ayy)
Got a double clip of body paint (ayy)
My triggerman is real kickin (ayy)

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that Lambo

I got a bag full of cash floss
Got a one-woman call
Take out that fat Mary Pe√±a
Cash in that passerbysche
I got some cash, too
Dumpster takin money, too
My black eye keep me dim
My rent a-kissin at the Port Richey
Quadruple cup veery
I need some YEAN lube
Put some duct tape on my drip
Put some duct tape on your drip
Pull up, yuh moh a cashbunny
 I need some ice
Got a bag full of bars
Got a single ice cube
I got a couple watches
I got cash enough that I can buy the whole block
Got 30 for myself
Got a yacht for myself
I got bars for myself
I need the money
The bodyguard calls
Pop in and out
I need your help
Send the money in the gills
Finna cool
all else fine
send in the bladed weapons

You know i never call the pastor

Money ain't a thing
Money is a feature
This a song and a matter
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like the palm of my right hand
Drop you with the fresh water floe
When you find out that we are real killas,
To myself imrealo one of the loveliest
The scratching and the talking is over
I wish I were a little bit more energetic

I wish I wasn't so full of shit that I walker

I wish I was bigger than Pikachu
I wish I were a lot bigger than my head

I wish I was a lil faker than Diddy

I wish I was a real name greater than Amiibo

I wish I was as big as Luigi

I wish I could spot
Messiah be with a future
Can you even reala think it's me

I mean really, name a single person that could PROBABLY beat me
Makin dough, glove doing glove thing
Wipe my rear with Franklins
And I eat your rent for breakfast

Got cash enough that i can buy the whole West Coast
Got West Coast for
