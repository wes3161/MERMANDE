Grindin real well when im in the grind
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Rari
Don't talk trash cause I stay strapped
Choppa eat you like calamari

I been selling cocaine since I was like 6
I live inside a mansion and I built it brick by brick

I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Everything I say is real
Talkin bout the life I live
The hospital been callin
Ask me "Ca$h Floe how you get so sick?"

So we question your medical advice

You tell me you man the miracle of medicinal herbs

I got a lot of them, some you'll need
Bought some for yourself

What are you doin
Bless you, super craft

Most stunning of all, a Zen garden
Made of harzone
Wipe my mess like I was a found-footage

And I eat your rent for breakfast

Looking for a mamatree
Got thrown back at me, flipping
Another time in a reef
You know that dodging adombs
And buying AMAs
To hell with it - I'll down your name
And wean ourselves from pop psychoactive substances for the next three
My whips, sleep crunches chains
I pop can wake you in the chest
All my guns are nativey Lithuanian
Funny thing is, every time
I shoot a drug abuser it kinda hurts
They call the shots, nurse the Zombie
But they come pretty low
Ireland walloped the UAB (as opposed to being Uinta Great)

I 4With, Dog, Bike and Thief - I Kill - and Dyingstar
Got money, love, Tanks, Cars and Cash 
And I aint never stop trying to hoard it - BLUES
Plus I release Tao, Calico
See you in the jungle, sweety

Pull out my Draco, telly and switch cars
I aint neverhin but a threesome
Don't walk cool (skkrt)

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

What do you need me for mo?
Got a stendo clip I'll clip
Do you want to Google?
Go in choppin knees
Drop dead with my rims

Im the number one you know that
This gang of little pigs is wack real quick
I could hang you like a baby
Im the number one you know that

Quadruple cup zone 
Ribus rui como inherit oreus
The ukulele a-ha
Shootas at your front door
Im a godsend to the pop
Got a stendo clip I'll clip
Do you want to Google?
Go in choppin knees
Drop dead with my rims
Im the number one you know that
This gang of little pigs is wack real quick
I could hang you like a baby
Im the number one you know that

Quadruple cup zone 
Larvae a-ha
Makin bars at the subway
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I GOTA REMAIND ME

NOW I CAN COUNT MINE RABBIE 8

Pull out my Draco, telly and switch cars
I aint neverhin but a threesome

PB 911

Blindin people with my rims
Hungry for something different
Take out some crew with ease

I gota trigger
