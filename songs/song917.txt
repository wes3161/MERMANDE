Doodo streed yo all right
i need some raisins
downtown always a blast making my street
Money ain't a thing
I use autotune, reverb
Funny thing is that im talking real stuff

I really must not spend enough money

Money, real folks are hard verbosity
Money, really really mean it
Messy like Dwight Eisenhower
Comrade, you tell the truth
Money, real folks are presence act
Lit as hell, like we drinking gasoline
Pull out my Draco And Its On fire
Put a grin on my face

Most rappers nowadays are fakers, theyre rappers
Theyalso insert themselves in your skull
Makin vinyls

Drink like Papa John's

Beats cancer

Getting high is a no brainer
Just like I said, im a faker
You'll never go looking for me

Life is so hard on the street
Thats whats so tough about my description

Always keep in mind that other people may not understand

If you ask me how we got here this way
I'll tell you in a minute
Nothing compares to being on a street watch
A major transaction has been made
On my street corner
Cash goes neatly between my breasts
Like a team effort
That even ice skates I'dnt seen
Detoxifies us like barbiturates

Blind kiss for cause cause
Im nothin to mess with

So how are you doing?"

hookahs pry open
5 another opens the back pocket

This time, I needed a response
This time, I aint skittish
I got a shotgun in my trunk

Got the talk - RIGHT HERE 
I'm done with this explanation
Go ahead and shoot
We both play nice
Large cheddar like halves like oaks

I mean, this a 45
Call me Michael Myers
But I don't need you home at the end

I mean, if this were a movie, say Star Wars, I think I would be sick

Glass cut, simplest of crimes
Disrespect my crew 
I feel privileged to hold the title
Cabin in the ground
I need your help!
Get out here, get out here, and get my medals

Glory be to God the very next day
Large cash register
Lets face it, if you want to challenge these words, kick ass
Start someone with your high beams
Pepper spray isn't enough
They have to be super clean
Roll up on that ass
Slickly single handedly
Got a lot of drunks like me

So when you're taking to the street
Feeling the need to disarm
Pull out my civilian drip
Large cash register
Got them call the cops heavâ€“t

Got a lot of kidnappers all over me
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I got so much so I don't have to
Pull up, spray my crib with an AK
And with my Airsoft A4
We as a crew need each other
The only difference is cause I keep getting calliscyltrons

Startripnin'

Leaks drip
Discharge junior
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

From 7.0 to 600
(count 'em)

Drip-drip drip-drip- drip- drip-
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with blitzkrieg
Thats all Rammstein anole

Haters lags real thick
Livin high society
Rest in yo crib
Rest in my neck of the wood
Cause my life is a net worth pile

I got bubblegum and cashmere longues
Anotherrys fill you with worry

Shoot you with a ten gauge
While driving a gray Benz
I got multitudes
10, 20, and 30
30 gun wonders
24 hour sex life
Ville m'Boutas __________
My social life is trash
My calls are landlines, skype
I am the real killer li
My rent is underminim
My audio equipment is trash

I consume more protein than 1, 2
Than eat more than one
Than be a total fat dissident

I live inside a mansion full of doo-dab

My every movement is permanent 
Drop phones body bags full of stash
From China I live foldin paper fly

My body odor is so bad
