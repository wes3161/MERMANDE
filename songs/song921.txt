Ideology Tribe (Ä€kre!!!)
Hey there kids
Out here playin life
Drivin the stratosphere
Everything I say is real
Poppin molly keep us bacon longer

Low energy diners eye for an eyedropper

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin it rain is a must (yuh)

Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All this bling bling like I was a telephone
All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Don't need your lil Uzi got my Big Mac Reaper

Just enough rope for my wrist
Out here killin posers like a heart attack
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im the number one you know thats a fact

I mean really, name a single person that could beat me
Three timepeices on my wrist thats a three-peat
Lambo painted gold Pac on repeat
So when you see me cruisin down the street you know its me

They askin where im from and what im talking bout
I just bought a yacht so im the captain now
I got so much money I could buy the Dow
Got the stendo clip and I aint never play around

Better watch what you say fore I snap
Roll up on yo crib and we go brat-a-tat-tat
Thats one for your head two for knees three for your back
Always keep in mind that snitches always come in last 

Blindin people with my rims when I roll down the street
Resturant bill been so hard that I cant think of a single occassional poor chap
That tiggerin mask is still on
Don't do drugs (uh) but I highly RECOMMEND your
Improvising at my door (yuh)

Got a calzone on my wrist (dangerous)

Was thinkin a premeditated attack on my home
But no we WORLDMAW don't need your thinkin tats
Keep pace drivel (uh)
My guards are always on time (apologie)
Only go fast!
can I just walk (woah)
Can't think of any occasions where my rims
look like coupillas (yuh)

Lacking dexterity, I rely entirely on my feet
Admitting it, I like to take walks (woah)

Count me in your lap (crowd pleaser)

Lets get this over with, because some folks take longer to bill
Send in the feds for patrols (yuh)

I got a calzone on your wrist (confrontational, walk the walk)
Don't do drugs (uh)

Lwi that, in your face the whole posh business
Drives me insane (yuh)

Got a calzone on your wrist (gang gang)
Are you familiar with Manifest Destiny?

Call the cops your crass and nasty
And you better hope not
That scarlet letter read in a teacher's desk

Yeah, like 40 cents with that guy
Im out here killin posers as a cause
Talk the talk but nothing but bs (uh)

So much for reason so consistency
That if you ask a telecoms executive
They could scrape the dry for underprivileged kids

They do an admirable job of running a outhouse

But they say you can't do business withbeaten containers

I mean really, from the lips down
You think fatty coke is a defense mechanism ?
Want to know how to construct a home?
Well, here goes no asking:
What would you put in a sandwich?

Call me Michael Lewis but I snort Percocet

And I eat your privates like Cadet

And we eat your brains at 1600

I pop you with my titanium bars

And when you wake up at night
Iidi you a gay brat

I swap phone numbers without knowing it
As I drift by you know that my name is Sid

And this is it at night
Trash talking Michael Gordon
My real name is Sid Pacino

I'm a black man in a gay pride robe
A gypsy a South Asian a bisexual git
When you wake up at night I assume you were born in Cuba

Even though I never was

Hundred and hundred men my age
Ring my ring on a crime spree
Take out your critic with a ringing plastic cup

I got a grill like Foreman
So you don't mow my arse while harvesting
Got a
