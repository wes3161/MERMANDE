It isn't anime at all:(9.50)(__D

Net wears purple, exposes fopp (yuh))
My assignments are clear(no questioning that belief)
My body contains almost no poisons
No money, no them(idaic))
Dont get federal bail, it would put an end to my petty kitty
To myself well done, ʳęhkm up u k
I use to do these whip making 
Now I wake up in the morning

9 to 5
10 to 5
11 to 5

Makin dough
7 to 8
I got the %
Take a beatcoin and sell it at a convenience store

While the walkman makes delivery

I keep making 15 Z's on the shelf

Like a really good heart attack

Turn your brain to three dimensional dots
And you'll realize that everything you say is true
For one day in the future
You could be one of the 100,000

I am so far ahead of this program
Tell that to Jesus Christ

Go in that driven stick
There you are -- a roboticist

Do you not rely on me?
$1500

Drip drip drip drip
Drop like drip
Slick doo wop
Droppin drip
When I go fast, it really does pop
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?



Drop 332 balls a day at once
Thats a whip (castle)/

Am I strappin clear?
To myself well done
Drip drip drip drip
Drop like drip
Slick doo wop
Droppin drip
When I go fast, it really does pop
What would you do if you had to walk in my 'at-will'

Priority one, I have no business
Runnin down every single bank
Money ain't a thing
Money ain't a thing

My worth is urs tenfold

Rest in Lil Peep

Full steam ahead

Even if you like cokeder
Now why don't you all have a chat
ALL MY DAMN ART DI DIE

For real

My career is at an end
My every touch is on full blast

Livin it be like 40C-YARDS WYTH cut
Drink all this mega champaign

If the cops come calling bout me they might come inside
Pull out my Draco

Got a thousand hits a day
Shoot you like your in it with the meg
All I'm gon be is snail mail

Ugh my gosh how can you write


Most rappers nowadays are fakers
In high society you wont see much
Lifestyle is highly paid
The more you work the more you make
You now hold the highest office in the land

You can mention New York well but it ain't so
Its true that so much of the wealth
Traveled the world making checks of more than
40 million
Then came to me with a massive-
I need you to find a better job
Now that I think about it
You know that back door
When my ass was full
You could walk in my glove

Now my butt is made of so much gold
That making dough isn't hard

Gucci killin crew bi-fold
They confer every single name
And I think for a fact I think of this board

What would you do if you had to walk in my feet

Now that I think about it

You know that MYSpace page says "Collaborative work"
I thought you were silly
That would put a stop to your thoughts
Do you think I'm insane
