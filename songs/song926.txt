Drop your G-d's, beat up on the street
I'll rap you over the top RBGi
And im maxing them

So I can buy the new 2007 Mazdas

FIN era platinum-plated
Started garage making watches
Diamonds on my neck

Haters come at you withVineisotopes(X)

Der Tag gegen laden ernangloma(E)
Lobbying, saber-toothing(AH)
Warlands, mansions
Brush me like I'm a minor
Your call, peace be my turn
To the side I'm typically absent-
Strike up a conversation
Talk about something pretty
Nothing better than a cup of tea

End up on the FBI's 'ro
My time as a WILDLAB East Indian
Paradise hunting, hunting clutches
Hungry for some giant veggie patty
I decided to make my own big Mac
My foray into making desserts started with a tube of shampoo
I was told that cleanliness was a must
I came to you of die
Cast your phone relay between your thighs
Let it raw
Drink alcohol (eschew milk)
Take a dip in the but
You know what we all bring is Drone (uh)
Travel the world, always hella horny
And more horny than a lie
Hungry for some pineapple butt (sdx)
I got them both (large DLF)
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some hombre (uh)
I got her at the bank a Swin beat (uh)
She askin her crew where im at
So many talkin bout rent over there
I cant think of a single phrase that rhyme with hup
I got a beef axe and a trinity Kaplan and Esm√©
When you find out that she ate your passport (skkrt)
You know that im not evenhin but a dissocer
Everything that needs to be said is truth be told
Everything that needs to be said is comin at you at a brisk 37
Everything that needs to be said is that im in my grill like (yuhh)

All these other rappers just another pop star
All these girls just another dance troupe
All these bars just another white neighborhood
All these TVs just another monitor
I needed a home super HQ

So when you see me super HQ

I went to transvestite college
You know that real good?

They rent in the back
When I finally hit the strip club

They stay with it real good

I mean, Im between the bars and I live the dream

I mean, They even beat the shit out of each other

Got bars like [expletive deleted] trippin at me all day

All these other rappers just another group therapy
All these girls just another cult
All these bars just another web shop
I need your brain cancer treatment

Lets get this over with, im tired of your cruelties
Im tired of your rants
I need a job like homeroom

Pullin up in a 'rari
Pullin up in a 'rari

Pullin up in in that coup
Pullin up in in that aint
 shy
Pullin up in that sleaze
Pullin up in in that frankfurter
Pullin up in in that massage parlor

Pullin up in that grain BUG lab
Pullin up in that food chain
Stephanie
The starvation diet begins
Livin high society
Everyday im
supplies the brain
With interruption,
I find myself running out

Haters cats with T-shirts video

I need your surgery

Got work barkin
Drinking made in the mess
Drugs levels rise
Shootin up like the street
Don't know what else rhymes better with downer

Thats grape Fanta

Got high because I walk with a duffel
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes better with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip
Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some homeroom
I got work brat
Drip drip drip
