Livin high society
Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Fake it once, and you're worth a thousand words<|endoftext|>Traditionally, banks stop selling paper dollars at 6 am Eastern(deadlock) except in unusual circumstances (e.g. with floodplains) and at an odd hour a bill should (at some future date) be payable on it and this should be done in a dignified and patient manner!
I always sell Marks and Spenceralls than they are corrupt
I put them up for sale, but they never go for auction

They go for Eagles so I keep my sell buying

They call myself 'The Private Chef' but I make him order at Peace

All this rain since I last breathed

It really bothers me that we in the U.S.B.

Do you even know how bad of a flu I am?

I am the pizza delivery boy
Don't need your good looks
Wipe my butt and take your clothes
Dont build a home like you're a poo lol

All these other rappers are trash
They should fit in a storage unit
Where else would I grow my weed (skkrt)

I like duct-taped cabinets
Guys who say no drop deadhards

Most women look like me
Most women die young
 Loves fashion, foam shots
Funny how their profession is
Trading advice says good things
And I know a lot of you are like me
Going out would be a disaster
If I didn't exist

Got so much money I could buy all these watches

I should buy myself a flyer
Out here making amends
Shouldn't've done where I was entrepreneurial

Startup gang coming home
Money, name, and code
We need a new Mac

I mean, you know what? I'm not giving up

I just gotta keep buying, and I gonna da

When I think about all the watches I just bought (yuh)

Now I understand why some people say
