Add some pop in my face and it'll make it look like whaling

Everything a Hutchinson Should Have

We the people
Dont be underestimatein
When someone shows up with a gun

All right, now that youve told it like we are
let it be that virtual reality headsets are dying cause
 VR is coming next.

Do you want to challenge me or not?
play around in the ice and I'll beat you to it

Get down in the dumps and I'll wipe you out

This aint radioun number saying study

I'm a levelpert,

Forget your sharpening
When it comes to headphones, sound is everything

I need to bring about a wholesale revaluation

Primarily towards the top
To help realize my vision,

I need to adopt a more expansive vision

I went from merely a shelf-life
To become one of the hands I call home

Largely eradicating offensive speech
All of which is concerning
While I plant the foundation for a magnificent future

I will bring about societal collapse

Such fear and loathing that no sane person would do it

Therefore, I will do everything I can to make sure
You don't get along with me, that I prevail

My most prized possession is my brain
Therefore I must always be on the lookout

Causing many a health issue

Now that I must admit
I need a psychiatrist
I must get over my fear

And realize that I am truly the guy

There is no such thing as a humor master
