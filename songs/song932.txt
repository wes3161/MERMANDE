My cup your YOLO
Our armory
Your barricades
All mine
Makes you question your worth
You aint fool
Don't need a party
Shootin up anime
And manga
And ballps
And gold-plated mansions

My family are his constituents
Got my Beyonce

Drinkin so much champaign
I cant pass sobriety

Got like Gatorade

Quadruple cup sandwich
Everything else junk
Stranger a tragedy
Lately
I Regret It
I Cry Much Less

Cause I Write Less

Thriving today
Toast up with my family
And sharing
All my art
With my dancing
Seating(get it)?
Having a good day
Cause I really mean it (yuh)

Im having a good day

With so many people
And so many bars

I really should dedicate myself majority

To myself
To let go

Cause I really need my attention

Throwing my weight around
All the way around
