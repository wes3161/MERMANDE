Emails are really, really, really, really, really

Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I been drippin so hard that its a flood now

All these diamonds on my neck I coulda bought a home
Throw my wallet in the sky and its a downpour
Put my wrist up in the air and its a snowstorm

Lived that lie since I was like4>ln
Only a fool would take this joke
For real
Fake rappers lie so much
They even quit
All these films they make money

Robbed bank accounts
Got cash inside my own home
Makin money every day
Poppin molly, dealblast
Makin cash on the street
Like a supergroup
Bout to mow the lawn

Every day since
2273
Money, power, and brutality down my spine
No game is too simple
Robbed bank accounts and made huge profits
Turn into attempted manufacturing
Now I need a police force

Financially strapped
To keep my gang together
I need a body
Three feet high
Plenty of dough
Got a lot of it
In this life im not sorry

Everything I say is
