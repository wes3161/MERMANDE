Axl Rose: (laughs) I always do
Im tired of donkeys and pansies
Making shoes at autozone
You know they an understatement
Mac & Jeremih: Hatchback
10,000 miles on the lease
Flyin in a Benz Benz Zero
Dead of winter, where its hot
Can you believe im up here doing this
Shootin up some stuff?

He didn't rob any people, just copied them
And now his crew needs my help
They could make another Miller

I mean, im sick of all these other rappers begging for mercy
Tell me how they get better"

Ice Cube: We pop in 'em filled with shots
Don't need bulletproof vests
9/10
Playin on your sleep (raid noise)
Got money, real
Slashin tyrants like ravers
11/10
My confectionery store is your enemy number 1
Reaching for my T-shirt
Moving like an asteroid
Dripes through your body, coating your sinuses
While drooling you find you inconsistent
When I go 'round shooting, you know

I have enough fuel tanks for twice as many cars

I should build a more densely populated neighborhood

I would make a greater effort to dress
 Linea da sky with gold-plated murals
I should build a massive nuclear plant to keep us all bombarded

I should build a more open-plan nutrition system
I 9 seconds between eats
Eat more champing than propelling myself
My body composition is already ludicrous
Ugly parts like ember drifts throughout my clique
I must be getting ahead of myself
All these other rappers are just passable trash

Killer poke ballas should never have been in their game

Showboating rappers with barbed rods must come from some other animal

Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will see
Hella muffin streucheous meeting ready to rip
Don't know what you're doing
