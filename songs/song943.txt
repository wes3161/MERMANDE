You're strapped for cash, so you just stick to the script
Send in the killah (uh)
Trash talking is what we do
Most of what we say is how you like
Imogen, Joe, being Joe Scarborough
We on tape saying the least
Bass buzz, talk trash
Got a lot of reverb
Far too much rock and roll
Lived at the top since the day I bought
Skated the strip, hung out with the party animals
My brain is made from platinum
Rich oleaginous tissue
Hungry for instant fame
Wont stop breaking into bars
