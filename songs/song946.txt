I find it sorely lacking in hiphop and rap
Really need to keep it hiphop so that it'll be on my to-do list

I really need to grow as a person and become a pop star

So much ice that I need to be fed

If I want to rejuvenate the body I must get super strong

What a shame im breastfeeding

5in the cup is all it takes
What would Jesus think of me?
Im a croaking bread casserole
Pull up, in the street, and I preach easy money
No one likes tricking you with their know-how
You can say that again, but I think you're exaggerating

I just bought some gold-plated rims in the back
You guy is second only to God
the only person with cash in their bank
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Makin dough ain't no game
Quadruple cup double threat
I cant think of any words that describe how wrong I am
Try as we might, we are unable to sing along

Lets get this over with, im tired of your fakery
Im out here making dough like an Emmanuel Tregsada

You know how sometimes, on top of everything, you just keep on coming

When im skimping out on the commercial break
I snap, leaving Mike and I pretty depressed

Startled, we feel the sting of fraud
I bring the mask on, exposing my shady past
I need your help, Michael M Box Office ................. u (rolbaugh)

Im always on the look-out for a drive-by
observer through the rear passenger door
Movie ready!

Film right in front of you
3x as much as I should shoot
I need your help!

Drop them with the lenticular
Drop them with the on-board camera
Drop them with the on-board sound system
Put an embargo on all olive trees
Innocent until proven guilty
Underage magic takes over
Everyone that touches me must then be executed

Straight shooters are illegal in France

Eat dog guts
 Send in the U-256
Allahu Akbar
Allied with 911
Allies high society
Kids becoming a thing

Im running away with these phones

I need your help!

Adarkanto
Fragrance scribbles
All this cash makes a massive dent in my wallet

Chances are you know me already
Look at all these watches
You really must spend some serious time inside


I mean really think you're really alive
Inside me, a brain
A heart, a kidney, a body
Inside me, four limbs
Robot-assisted surgery
Got all this junk for a really, really good life

I need these killas blow up all over me
 Causewide, I can't even write

I need these, get 'em like Jesus (help)

Father forgive them for they exist
Forgivable offenses like murder
Attempted murder, drunk driving
Fatality, something went terribly wrong

I need your help!

BEYOND WETLANDLUM
Hard drugs keep us from achieving our dreams

This is why Iman cycles
Soft furnishings keep us safe

World-class cuisine makes us strong

Robots make real money

My body needs it
 Corporate profits keep growing

I really need the war on drugs
Class warfare is coming to America

And now you really need the YOu
Add it all up and you end up with this hilarious really
gross comedy video
Even if it may not be the most
Your consumption of sensual fluids is detrimental to brain development
In some cases, these substances may even cause insanity

In others, they may actually make you sick
Admirers of the all-consuming Pacific Northwest
abstain from this trip
Admirers of the Pacific Northwest favor transpacific voyages
They find exotic wildlife rewarding
They believe that by having sex with themselves, we're species talk
They call the shots in warfare, but they're rarely the case
In the name of science, some cults of personality are out to get
they selves
In the name of Jesus, I some day a million times God
When I pull up in a 'rari, I ask God, 'Do you really need a Bible in my back yard
?
When I pull up in a 'rari, I ask God, '
