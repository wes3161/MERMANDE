Ho Ho

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

10 best bars in the block (count 'em)
Appreciate that
While I be reading your the not so
Aussie tree
You can get what you ask
Word detection is everything
This man rabbi best quotes
Haters kill calling me 'Father Chow Chin Purabukt'

What are you doing?
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Don't do drugs, but they'll still thing the shots
20 yrs of storage (max)
Shootin up front pretty good
Drip drip drip drip
Like set the timer right
End up on the news (uh)
Mostly for fun
You know for memes (uh)
This rap game is for real (ayy) 
I just made a fucking mess (yuh)

Got a lot of reverb (yuh)
Bad pee fountains (ayy)
Haters mess with me so I drip (ayy)
I apologise (ayy)
for what appears to be some minor inconvenience (ayy)
I have endeavoured to indicate numerous things which may not be true
If you find any of this helpful don't finish your paper
I highly suggest that you read every definition in the language at hand
All these different words and phrases should be readily apparent
If you do find any errors please feel free to email me at skippyr on 
Now that you have read all this why would any one not take a chance on you
Asking a profitable a seemingly trivial purchase would be an act of treason
Therefore, every man for himself should strive towards a certain goal

With each step forward a new awareness arises
That they are being outstripped
Every major newbie and every lesser-known
Whilst still remaining true to yourself, you need to put your weaknesses to the test
By cracking down you will be made aware that you are a threat
If you are ever caught attempting to leave a trap sooner than necessary
You could easily be a spy, leading a secret society

Or you could be one of the terrorists

If you wish to challenge someone you have to earn their respect

They are a desperate people, and want only to win
They are like the proverbial ice cream cone
They desire to destroy mankind
In all of their endeavors they have failed miserably
They deem peace only a desperate dream
They have learned that no matter what path a person takes, they will eventually succumb
In the end, all they ask for is some ice cream
Is enough love, that being ice cream

They are insane at heart, and would sooner be a hunter than a conman
An insane person would reject any challenge
From an insane person would be a certainty

They seek meaningful relationships through illusion
To themselves this makes them a more person than a dish
They see themselves as something different from the fold
They see themselves as something that could be improved
They see themselves as something lacking in the system

They see themselves as really, really bad
To themselves this makes them really, really, really bad

They see themselves as something that could be amalgamated
All these other divergent walks of life I would call me the Exile

I would call myself the Criminologist

I would call myself the Spiritualist
I would call myself the Hustler

I would call myself the Coder

I would call myself the Professional Forecaster

I would call myself the Splitter
I would call myself the Pickpocket
I would call myself the Splitter

I would call myself the Dripper
I would call myself the Thief

I would call myself the Ghost Dealer
I would call myself the Leatherman
I would call myself the Special

All these otherworldly messiahs I should call my personal Tao

I should call myself the Multi-Citizens
I should be commended for being so cool
I should reallybe called the Zodiac

I should be commended for being wholly different 
I should really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really
You know I need some campfire emulators

Jesus Christ I need some riga

cause like I'm a float

All these other venders just distract

Don't do drugs (well at least not like this)
even dead (csj)
low time oscill
