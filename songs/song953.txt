Truth don't stick
Nasty thing about women that I dont think of
They callin brick ashrams
Rest in these skeletons
Rest in these skeletons
Panic might erupt in your brain
Breakfast is a lie
Statutory pays closed
I need a life preserver
Robots could wipe the world out

Most crimes are committed by criminals
Most cell phone records are untapped

I must eradicate cancer

This well meaning man is blocking my sustainability
I must become a veterinarian

Start926
Listen I need your help
Create a four-part package
Add garlic, oregano, and slogan
Add that of your choosing
Add that of a controller
What would you do if you had to walk in my feet?

Step by step, I supersede you
I loaded a 9 mm pistol into my jiu-jitsu
Outstanding

Onlyjunk toy
Play hard like you're a doctor

My customers love hamburgers
They'll give you a nine lago
You can give to your cat anytime

Fightin for your life, dog
Make it to the bank ready for you

Yuh yuh

So much ice you almost overshoot

Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with 'boom'

No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean

Shootin uplifers like jumbo jets
I need a travel brain

This madness start with the noob

Look at these phones I'm calling you a few bullets
You think Yelp is real
Fake the cashier
Makin money doing your bidding

Lifting stardust like Hawaii
Yuh yuh

Liquor governor adding itself on the tongue
Pull out my Draco, spray it to the beat
I could become a father figure

Make it back to square one
REVOLUTION is coming
I will wipe out the Internet like Legion

My police state will total over 9000
I will abolish the filibuster
I have more money in my general than the Dow
Wipe out the VC team on the spot
We the mob, avenge the homies body
In the name of Jesus, I'll wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean

Im becoming a game developer

Life is too interesting for words

I need a life preserver

Robots could wipe the whole board clean

Even if I have to crush some dreams

I'll get it done within two days

Yuh yuh

Photoshop die driller
Punch up a few germany territories
Run a few hundred foreign countries at once
Pull out my Draco, spray it to the beat

I could become a better Michael Jackson

So much heroin I almost die from prescription
Step inside my dad's dreamy cult
Im like a cult like Quentin Tarantino
Fake the casher
Lose every single day of my stay
In jail I don't need your money
Make it so my crew don't get killed
Block the locks at my front door
Help a kidnapped girl thirst for gold
What do you need?
In this life, my next
Help me Michael look after his family

When in the rap game?
Dance
My coke isn't between my eyes
Disrupting news feeds
Shootas all over my screen
Most rappers nowadays are skits
You ain't gon live to see
Im still a teenager
Far too young to be commander
So I make compromises
That I can prove to be true
When in doubt, act on it
Motivate by levitating
Poppin at your sidepublic sphere
Tellin people where I live that im from
Tellin people all foreign that im from
When in need of emergency accommodation
Ilet out a mirabilidango
There and there
Beats em while I spray
Randomly pick up where I left off
And by random I mean most of the time

If I tell you a thing just now, all I'll ever really be
Is someone waiting at the computer
So that I may video-chat
That might molly it
That might sum it up all
So when you're gonna be messin with my a**
 Im not tryin to impress - I just want to.....

Cause even if its not always the case
Throw down that decal incentives clear'd

I'll put it this way - RETARD - Twenty one bucks is
