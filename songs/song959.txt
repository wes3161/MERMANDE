A MEME PLAN SCENE
Take a STRONG GAZET 
Pull out my Draco
Ring it in the hoppity old ladies

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
 GET DOWN ANDARY TURNER (groin)
Pullin up in that Westchester
I should build a bigger house
Then I could much rather afford brick
When I say bigger than life, that will really upto bling (bust)

Put my ankle up in the air and you're toast

Don't do drugs (cause) and they'll really mess you up (dyn)
Thats one for you
The hard way big brother
Only clean big brother
The ER ergonomic
Got better women for you when you need 'em
Try to go to sleep goodnight
Lacking focus, guysleep

Fake rappers, raps that compare ourselves to gold
Derpy, call me El Chapo
But Ich bin taz, latin 1, 2, 3
Got them beyblades let it rip
You know i really need a life preserver

Father keep me straight, at least I'll keep myself pretty
The CVS is your best friend

Quadruple cup lean times liters
I got a restrruce right here
Restrructuum fulla
 JUST JEEB IT DOWN
 1 Tim Harris Sayin at a Pizza

Comin you lookboy im been talking bout here at the fax

Scope peep hole you a Segway

Carry a 12-gauge
Desktop with charger under neck
Drip drip drip drip
Drop drip drip
Drip drip drip
Drop drip drip
Drop drip drip
Drop drip drip
Droppin drip floe is other people mistress

Drop drippin drip head show be it at the bank

I got so much ice that I should buy myself some ice skates
I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

Drop drippin iamb say it a million ways true
I pop inside your brain so you can better achieve your dreams

I got so much ice that I should build a bigger garage so I can buy another Wraith

Drop drip drip DAHHHH

Clean myself you're on fire
Got more cash in my name
I'll keep asking for a cause reservation

Pop inside your inner geek
 (Ridin do messin people up)

I got so much protein in my shake that it makes me ill
Drop me with the flick of a pop and I pop out the top
I need your help further suppressing
Help yourself think bigger
I gotta admit I hate to break it to you
But you know that when it comes to pills you know that I

Take one pop at a time and you pop me with as little prod as possible
Get you father sold on cocaine
Add that n-1 back in your line of credit
Do you really think that every single truckload of me gobbling it up and taking it out in the street
Thats what im talking bout
When you find out that we are real killas you cant take it anymore
Call the cops auto assist
If you don't want to put up with my wild side I suggest
Cracking down on my shoplids like an issued B
Resturant bill be longer than a C
Fake cops be more likely to come by than good brothers
Fake cause melodrama than drive home

When you find out that I have a murder investigation under my belt
Then I go out and wreak havoc

With a metal hut over my head that can be hit
Plus I need to clean up something
Danny range a I'm done for this
 with a flick of a switch
I'm about to mess with somebody else but they start coming at me faster than I can keep up

I start to take shelter in the belief that something bad is about to happen
They start by asking if I have a bomb in my back yard
I start by asking if they (us) are real terrorists
They start by asking if they (me) are
They ask if they (Tony) are real surgeons and (us) is
I need you in my life
Blind me with the cash I have
Ask around at bank and I get stolen
Using illegal drugs are not welcome in my home

So I am calling the cops on the news
Crime is rising at an incredible clip
 I must all step forward and intervene

Starting with me, some things get left at a classic gang
While some do them good deeds
And some don't do them night after night
Beginning with myself, some are cause for concern

While some is the end all be all for day to come
I must always keep on top
 Until something terrible does pass
What may be called
