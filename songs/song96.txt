From 7am - 6pm

Got some gloves, some flip flops
Got some watches, some jewellery
Lacked cash, I was more like.. cashin
 Toothed primates, my only need is your brain
Cashin checks, my bank details
Most electronic transactions mean the sheet metal at my bank

They ask for money in Euros, this is illegal in my court

Got thugs, they ask for my life
I got a lot of them, so I need your help
Releasing my demons, knocking the hell out of some astroturf survivors

I got so much money that I could buy the entire Dow
I need a currency processor, so I can buy all these watches
Baking, cleaning, and even listening to Leonard Cohen
Pullin up in that Lamborghini

Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that Maybach

Pullin up in that Rari

On their lawn mowers cause im cuttin up

Hi there kids
My name is Ca$h Floe
Im coming here today
To tell you not snort coke

Just lask week
Some guy came to me
And told me how his brother died
From smoking PCP

I don't need any purple in my cup
Cause taking drugs makes you dumb like Forest Gump
Drug are illegal, and doing them is bad
And every time you smoke weed it makes Jesus sad

What up home bois
The name is MC Mac
The truth is that taking drugs isn’t really wack

Don’t listen to Cash Floe
He never done blow
Therefore he don’t know
What’s coming from Mexico

It’s so good
It’s so tasty
It’s so fine
Funny thing is that their there all the time

Just hit up the dealer
He knows what you need
He da true healer
Try the tainted weed

The trips are the best
In the jungle with a cult
I feel really blessed
And now I’m a true adult

When I was an adolescent
I abused mucinex
Now finally all grown up
I smoke cigarettes

Adderall, ritalin, ecstasy, caffeine
I tried them all when I only was a teen

And look how I am
Do I look like a fiend?
Maybe so
You don’t know
Hold up, Imma do mo blow
