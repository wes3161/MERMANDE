Quadruple cup oh my gdp
There aint no one better than me at hiphop
The only thing worse than hiphop than rap is that its in the rearview
To myself im real mean, to myself im porridge
What would a grown man look like?
Messin with my crew to a draw
Alright at the top I pull up with a device
There and back again I go
Now I must admit im rapin through my brain

I cant think of any words that rhyme with rippin

Now I must admit im writing in my brain

There aint no one better than me at navigate
All I do is dream up some obscure concept
They soon awaken to find that im already gone

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Turn your earphones off, and you maybe bump bump bump

But you know that im already gone
Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu busting in the scene
Hungry for some throats and spleens
I'm gonna wipe the whole board clean
Even if I have to crush some dreams

Iâ€™m ludicrous, rhyming astutely with voodoo paste
Most of what im talking bout
Workin like I mirror Tutti
Even though im a fraud

Makin dough, makin dough like Papa John's

Turn your earphones off, and you maybe bump bump bump
But you know that im already gone

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Big Mac Bleu bustinin in the scene

Hungry for more oxygen than a clique
To myself im real mean, to myself im porridge
What would a grown man look like?

Messin with my crew to a draw
Alright at the top I pull up with a device
There and back again there go

Joel become my bodyweight
You know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a g, your nothin but a fraud
Makin out of subpoena paper
Got them beyblades let it rip
Don't know what else rhymes with drip
No shoelaces I don't trip

Hyena become my block blinding me
I want you to know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta use this as a template
Everything im talkin bout is a lie
All I do is dream
And find your clique's home page Here
Disband the phishing troves and start asking around

Now, I understand that some shops don't accept unsolicited Promo codes
I just want to make sure you're worth my while

So, buy some gloves (cause dust will accumulate in them)
All this and that, and ten more
I'll keep you up at night

Better start saving these days (ayy)

All these and that, and a hundred and ten other people
You never ogle my mattress (yuh)

Hungry for some lobsters (ayy)
My prowl is non abysmal (ayy)
Only a fool would take my wrist as evidence
That comin at thier employ manny
Works just like Bill Ebert's

Works just like George W. Bush

Illicit drugs make hell of hoards of real folks
Drug use is the number one cause of deaths
In America we are blessed with the FISA court

Big Pharma is a streaming society
We are the future and we are at it fat cats
Out here killin humans for fun
But
