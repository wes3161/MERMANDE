Hey Im not funny
I make yo dough
Blindin people with my rims
They askin where im interning
Get on the street and say hi
 Im the number one you know me just sayin done deal
You never know who can come in first
Pull up, and you gon' callin me the nyc
Got a calico four street high

Pullin up in my Benz, I spray

I got a cruise ship floating in the South
Everything I say is real
Elbows is threat, strategies laid bare
My military paint is a shade darker than your average cap

Now I must admit I think of today's headlines

Easier with different compacts: money, murder, time
Better use of a credit score better protect you from the inbuilt monthly pay rise

So how do I get the ball rolling? Well, at some point (usually between installments) you gonna gotta get used to it.
They gonna at least put me in some pretty desperate need
I got a rari/. We aint never outmatches 'em.

Quadruple cup rollied Upskirt
I live inside a hacienda
The drone they're circling

Messages all over my body, including my ring finger
I use force studies to see if I can match them to any one person
They say hiphop is merely poetry

My garb reflects the true meaning of my words
