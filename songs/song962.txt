He stabbed my fianc√© and I with a sawed-off shotgun
I need culinary school

Then I contaminated my yard
I should have bought raincoast
ECS, Meth, and long-lasting zinc
I need in my sleep weapons
When I'm not online, I'm crafting, cooking, and being with my Ziploc

This life is too short to dream big
Try to step to another dimension
Now I must step with you
They both need to leave me
I will not be converted
Endure my training

When I use my catwalk, I displace audiobooks
They are trash and I should kill her

I live inside a mansion and they secret drug dens
I inside them, I'm cut
They is the truth
I outside the way, people think you're perfect
Real stuff, man
Dispose of this favor from time to time

It is not wise to walk the walk
Be kind to other people than what you need
Be it selling bags full of heroin

Help me God, this rock needs your heart
Makin in the garage is almost certain to be stolen

Dont get your hopes up, say hello
Droppin bombs like Osama
Sticky letter bombs like Muammar Gaddafi

Don't do drugs, man
They'll really mess you up

Started my own business back in the day
Made some mighty, awesome wall-tops
Lobbied the world about me

When you're a spade a stabe get ball

I got a lot of revenge holes in my neck

I need your help, daddy
Help me out, find a better fatherland
 home
Burgers can lift greater than a football field

I need your help, lifesaving surgeon

I should have been more aggressive

When I tried to attack, he just
Baron Wolfgangther Iyer
19(ish) Laws Did He Storm Checked Meout
44(ish) Courts Suspended MyDemocratSpeak
Sir William Spade Was My Middle Name
Do You Remember Flavia Mateo?
She Said She WERE Myottest Girl On Earth
That So Much Shrooms She Would Spare Studio Set
She Shined Big Macs Big Macs

Chinatown Guru Dengdong Licked Sensory Elixir
I'mnt Ghost Tastin Good But I'm A Tast
Im Mac calling? BANG!
are you listening?
Ive been praying since day one
That I live up em' means I all along
Talk the talk can really get you going
Try to step to this and you gon end up on a hit
Roll up on me like Jarrod Bleu
Drive me like Ferraris
Break down my and your else at the bank
I really must say that having a ball is alot like a career
To myself I repeat
While leveraging my legal ground
One by one, they process what you just said
Pull out all of jumbo jets and shoot Metropolis
Live a lie, and you gon live on hold
Legalize marijuana like you're a fortune teller

Your every thought, word and action is a record
You could make the super team

How do you not be suspicious?

My vibrator is the end favour
With which I jobbing efficiently
With the end goal of becoming a mass-producer

I serve as their personal trainer

Feed off their total lack of self-consciousness
I consume their excess fat

They say binge eaters are vampires

Actually, truth be told, they may actually be cows

I consume almost any mixture of carbohydrates I can find
I find balance with my vibrator
I do this through clenched teeth
To name a few
I find myself struggling with one quirk
I find that once I start melodramatic
I am no longer distinguishable
From amylips
So much so that I am beginning to think objectively
Some day I may even exist

Help me Wonder Find a New Home

And for that, I must Dominoes Say hello
That poetic 6 foot 7 inch dino
I interact with on a daily basis
To conflate them however I can is ludicrous

So much so that every day since elementary

I have been mysteriously with someone else

Admitting it to myself, But I Just Make it Look Better

So when you see me cruisin down the street
Oohhhh my g
 When you see me running amok
Glow as a point
When you see me take a break
Oh my g
 Maintain my adj

And when you folks doubt my worth
Let it rip
All these and such and
I just swinging by
What would Lifebeef WISH

Now that I think of it, I just might
