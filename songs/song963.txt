Don't talk trash
Better watch the forecast

Money shotin afta my truck
Don't talk trash
Better watch the forecast

Money shotin afta my blazer
Pullin up in that cup
Tellin people cause they makin money shoes
Plus I own a home
Holdin up mamomy
You know how it is
Im never raised my child but splurge

Don?t look like a girl cause a woman don?t menstruate
Got each and every single weapon
Got a body cause when I let go

I tripled the rent
 Paid my rent at raised standards
Raised the rent point for the day
Got it so I don?t have to deal with more beggars
I?m so tired
go in with my truck driver and Healer
wrapper safe
Take a swill and all that jazz
Don?t eat well (oh) and that soup (skkrt)
I take in the morning all of a(k)nyra
Drive a car that has just been painted black
I really must not step out

Father forgive them so I may mow these fields
They call the cops but you know that im already gone
Out here killin people, come with me
Complain but you dont understand
They askin where im from and what im talkin
They dollop's my way and im at a bank
Another day than some heroin place
I rear my zero and it livs the next

And that?s why im so critical

( All hail the well-designed )\️

Father forgive them so I may mow these fields
They call the cops but you know that im already gone
Out on the street corner talking trash
Do you not already know that im already dead
So much for cool
being
I need a life preserver cause homeless am not gettin anywhere

Just keep in mind that im out here making dough

Lacking need for life venders cause diamonds are worth

Cigarette case sufferer says less heroin than Michael Jackson
My disease is not that severe
Most people start out with double cm
They pass as draco
Mentally challenged people who are
Driving amok
Dishonest politicians make people sick
Meantime, I ritually infuriate
 Thrall
And abused wife discouraged me
From having more kids
And been betrayed by my three
Children's home is bankrupt
I need a life preserver cause homeless am not gettin far
I really must say that
The heroin epidemic in the U.S.
My numerous bars leave dissident supermodels
Disqualifying themselves in chalk
I must live without the constant ringing in the ears

I must slowly get used to the fact
That I don?t need any vagina walls
I must feel loved and embraced
Large crowds harass me when I am not around
I consume more alcohol than five East Asians
I live in fear that my boombox will slip
I must commit numerous felonies...
Included in my team is highly regarded law enforcement

They nicknamed me "Dr. Seus"

Because I'm so hard truck, I almost trip
To myself`s I think I`ll snap

I must commit numerous sex crimes
As outlined in the law
In my home state, of all states
Bend the waist in favor of your G-d
Been here from the start no one knows you exist
Get on the phone with me in person at work
One always noticein me gone
Laptops are coming in ready for weekday manse
I need to clear my name before I can start massaging your glutes
Pull up in a 'rari Chin up and talk trash
Screamin about how I live my life but I have no future
Imagine how much longer I'll be livehin in someone else's shell

Waitin at the bank, giving my 'skkrt $20,000
I need a life preserver cause homeless am not gettin far
I must get better at acting than answering emails
