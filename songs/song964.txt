Do a hair mogul's Q&A
Ask him how he can make ends meet
I mean, super stupppppppps
Add that constant reliving a travesty
In my sack
Driving fat Samoanists
Having a son
Makin shoes
 Fucking wipe the whole board upside the head

Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Don't do drugs (uh)
They'll really mess you up (yuh)
Thats a bomb under my nose (ayy)
Got a lot of open codes (aye)

Dont pull so I don't break any laws (ooh)

Always clean my place hot
Im always superdick good with the mechanic

Got a lot of about in my garage
Shootin up everything and Leaving No One Below

Pullin up in that 911
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Don't do drugs (uh)They'll really mess you up (yuh)
Thats a bomb under my nose (ayy)
Got a lot of open codes (aye)
Dont pull so I don't break any laws (ooh)

My homie Lassie Manta Ray

 Im sicker than an old man takin heroin

I need a life preserver cause im on life support

Respawn, shoot, shoot
Like a war zone

Bout 'aodes

Como quendades
Explosive, I-am-rich
You is the next Elon Musk

REAL AS RAG

Opens doors and shuts them
Adoration: Meryl Streep

You know what would be far sooner than Okja?

homophobia nonveg
Everybody act funny, everyone behave like kids
But I think I bring cold water
For using pseudosciences
To understand gay people you must understand adult discourse

I have been told that a gay person is somehow 'oppressed,' 'isolated' and a 'traitor,'
This really does mess with your life
I am sick of it calling me a dissident

I am sick and tired of it Hollywood — xo DuCAPt̙r
My class is so privileged that they really deserve our respect
They need to start having parent rallies
They are calling the shots every day

They say the most important thing is that we are 'The Chosen,' and that we are blessed , you know that

Every day that I am not around I feel like an outcast

Every time I click the wrong link the real review will pop

I hate the system and hate the believe it
Every single thing that we say makes a difference

Because every day while taking classes at Catholic colleges
I become more immersed in my writing
The more I take every question as fact
I become more reflective
My writing style makes me look like a caveman

I hate the system at my core
I have been held to a high standard
I have never even been allowed a single thought
