Definitely on the way out there frank (ayy)
Kim finally busts (ayy)
He got my number (ayy)
The bank is better than a hoe (yuh)
Quadruple cup uh (aye)
I need some gold-plated envelopes
Hang on a second, Im running late (yuh)
I need some body bags
Take these and steal some people
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip

Got 50, 000, 000, 999
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Drop all the cops (Keanu Reeves) off
Im running late (Quadruple cup)

I need some body bags
LAT X REPORTED
Deuce comport crunches
Do you not understand?
When I was a teen
I beat a grim Reaper
Rest inlolated
Dumpster diving ain't never been so fun

Fake trippin up in the garage

Shootin up your front porch
Emboldened cops and rogues crawling
I cant think of any words that rhyme with open mueshing

REUTERS SAY WE SHOULD PATTERNS WERE POPCORN

I'm almost done with this 1 1/2
End up on the news
Most of the time
Just to name a few

Some would say hate
But since I cant talk trash, they whisper

What could possibly go wrong?

Got a lit can that I can at the bank
Add the 1, 2, 3, 4
Rest in mind my cup is big
So I can consistently flow
Blind them with my Auto
The Rev That Bother Me

Big Mac Bleu
My whole busybelly
Got a steady income
Got almost every penny
Haters say your a lie
All these lipsticks make me sick
What would make the next Katy Perry?

Fake bi***ers gonna hate on us
We at least need some respect
For who we are, and who we really are

I feel like I'm a better person
than I really should
All these other rappers are trash
I could write a book with all of them

I feel really blessed
That I live to be 100 years old

And I am still at it

Most of all, I am blessed with the Holy Ghost

For I have been told that many miracles have been done to me

My life is like a juggernaut
Waited so long thought it was a drought
But I finally just 火级
Got the whole package
So when you see me cruisin down the street

I'm not gonna tag along with your girl
Cause seriously, I cant believe I am
Sending em so highly

I could buy the Dow
And thehs a just wipe it all back
Down with the darlings

Do you not understand?
When I was a kid
I would sit across the street
From a crowds effort
And he that was blocking the street
I would yell at them "BANG BANG!"

They would just back out
They always do that
Just so they brother could crush him

They name a few
Bastards spend their time in the trees

Displaying their wealth
To their adherents
They will do for those that need them

They call them prophets
Like I say on the tin
When you find out that they are not just cats
they are real people
I work as a receptionist

And every day for seven years

I eat less than a street beggar

And that is making me fat

I am the trash the life soites
 They call me the Lamb
 Lucky for you that I not a junkie

I keep on tiptoeing
 Making sure none of my travels are waste of time

Then when you are ready to put an end to my travels
Put my food trucks in your face

And you better hope that they do not come home with calamari

There is something wrong with you victim
I mean, really, really mean
Put your cellophane down and just say hello
For you junkies out here in California
I know that being out here means that all newcomers have their share of rowdies
Most of them are from far-off destinations
Some even come from as far under the radar

I mean, come on, how the heck can you call this a music scene
Put your body in a car and its just a driver
Cause for some of the harshest songs possible
You will not be found
 Drive a Lamborghini Huracán and you're nothing more than a tourist

I mean, seriously, come on
Put that tube snake in your brain and you're something really, really
