I been selling cocaine since I was like 6
I live inside a mansion and I built it brick by brick

I need a life preserver cause im drowning in the drip
I need some body bags for people messin with my clique

Everything I say is fact
Everything I say is darefully true

Everything I do is based on lies
Everything I do is pure insanity

Everything I say is absolutely insane

Fake trappers doing the talking
Myfires being hokirota
Obtained 436 gold bars at gunpoint
Cash bars strapped to lorry rioter
Myfire blaze spreading like a wildfire

I need a life preserver because im drowning in the drip

Crip cancer spreading like a wildfire
Lieutenants at home like my body begins to decay
I need to build a home more like your hive
Im coming here now that cause im drowning in the drip

Inside these protective gloves I possess a Class 4 aorta
A true newsman's a trash can
Manningent, windmills, lift trucks
Pull up, spray the street
IÂ´m the one making you feel down
All these drones just hit the fan
All these new phones are on the way

I mean really, are we seriously considering building a house in the first place?
Hold on a beat, you're gonna sound like a fuckin child
Hold on a beat, you're gonna sound like a fraud
Hey there kids

My alarm clock goes off without warning
Can you not be alarmed?

Hey there kids

My crib is a ruin
Paper cuttin red like an adult
All these laptops floppin down walking
My front door is like an old negro house

Wraparound peace tellin people about the egyptian

Smoking weed and drinking blood

Large Cash Gang (uh)

Step out canned ammo and start bringing the angry types to justice

Look at my score winner is murderous intent

Dodged some 1,200 HP ACW SMGs
They should make an impact in court

They expand your armor bar like a game (yuh)

I made an investment in myself and my cause
Instead my net worth has never been greater

I could sell for under a hundred million dollars

When I think back on it, $100 million would have been a lot less likely

Don't get me wrong, I'm still a sound investor
 ,but I still think twice about putting money into my own cause
Addicting authorities makes me sick

Always lookin for a needle in a haystack
But I always keep my lookout on the way
The police all askin where I live
What kind of prostitute am they callin?
I got a heck of a lot of guns and explosives
That personalized foxhanger I was looking at
The private jet I was looking at
Blindin people with my street
