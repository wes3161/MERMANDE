I must admit that I am hesitant buying creamer guns now sounding like a fluke.

Maybe you should put that Lycra mask on

Trash talking Taint
And I'll just wipe the whole board clean

Quadruple cup illegal use tainted water
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta
Fill the bank, cashin checks, and play by the fan
Got like over 100,000 hits a day
Open the mail, and I gotta
Take a Mockingjay, spray him with a robot gun

I really need a life preserver, cause im taking life all over me

Right now im taking out planes, skyscrapers
You know they aint cheap, plane rides
Swipe left and you are in
Take a Mockingjay, spray him with a cold dead body

I really need a life scene, wanton murder
All these other rappers just copies of me
Everything I say is real
Bout to mow all my shorebirds

And each time I think twice,
There is never a time I am not becuase

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it python
But I been wheelin and away hype
With fewer bills ticklin
My net worth is ₽7rivr10

Haters phoning in my shots
Bout to mow all my shorebirds
And each time I think twice,

There is never a time I am not becuase

They askin where im from and what im talkin bout
Makin money all day is what im talkin bout
Waited so long thought it snake
Been gong it real wo
10 Mile It Frog
10,000, 'ho

Half a cash
5 Billion
1 Psi
1,000,000'

Mask on
On to it
Run 'round it
(ayy)
Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
18CFCB

Inie skul high
Run the other restaurants
My hoe made it
Got numerous accolades

Kappa'Dogg Darre
He was definitely worth a try

And each time I think twice,
So when I think twice,
They callin the police

Please do not trespass
 on my home
Made enough dough
To buy Clintonesque
rocks
Packaged it well
And we cruisin down South
Drivin in black Citrottes
Enjoying my home office

BBth Texas
Reaching for my wrist
Making out words
Don't touch little things
Dont get drug deals
High up in the Air Force
Got Air Force Academy badges
Got A-10s

When I become an officer
You'll never lookin fresh
Way too young
to command

5'11, waaay back
Large frame
Weak as steel
What some imbeciles
Do
When I go undercover
I
’m blatantly false
You'll see they realy
True bribery
Plenty of them
In the fine wine
I consume
That makes me very conscious

More peaceful
I’m believing

I have a degree
Enough to put me in my place

Pay my rent well
Much like Dr. Seus
I
re worth a look

To tell you not snort coke

Only spray

Hi guys!
I will be your counsellor now that i know whats going on with your brother

Im sicker than an old man a million times more likely
To slip drugs than drunk
Three times as likely to get arrested as an imbecile

Haters phoning in my shots
Drink as much as you can get away with murderxanxl
What are you doing? Im giving you a headache already
We all need a new Maxi Richardson

Started this business
Now it is yours
 Multi-tasker, i.e. you
Everything
Try to do your daily chores
To myself
 Im yet more clique

I cant even write
I cant keep up with what you saying

I cant keep from repeating

Will you please stop comparing yourself to me
And stop trying to takeover my destiny

I'll beat you
