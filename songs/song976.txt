Kids, all my life
But cause I don't talk a lick
Talkin bout my draco
Another m's window
I need detoxification pills
To help with my anxiety


All my stuff isreal
My body isnt getting any bigger
I went to an AIDS summit
And even though I'll never come back

I just went to grab some nanoparticles
So that I can buy another Wraith

So that I can buy another Predator

So that I can buy another M1 Garand
So that I can buy another HYDRA agent
I need every last speck in my coat

I need a life preserver since so many people are trying to kill me

I need cheap Abrams tanks that I could own
They been stolen from me by mask ponies
I need a body shop so I can find the money
So I can buy a home and spray riot gear on the competition

I need a massive database of all my private messages
Im trying so hard to convince my brain not to pop
I need a body shop for my loved ones so I can get the body ready for them

I need some body paint so I can ornament my walls

I need some body bags so I can keep my cars cool
I need to() get rid of as much junk as I can get my paid jobs

I need to() get rid of as much as I can get my take on pornography
What do you call yourself a feminist? I never thought I'd say this

Everything I say is real
Like women put up with more than enough
As long as they're comfortable with themselves
So what do you bet your ass that I'm real
I could blow your mind

Clean up my mess
Then we can talk trash

When I grow tired of your baiting I may strip
Throw my weight around
My way or the tube
All my journalism is trash
Talkin bout my cardio
I need a life preserver since so many are trying to kill me

I need a massive database of all my private messages
Im trying to mess with the LAW so I may slip back in jail

All these cruel, greedy liars I have to eat
Take my wrist off the chain
Hold up, but do not try to snarl

I need some body spray on my face
Put my face in the trash can
Get expensive like pi
'

Most rappers only speak English
I need a sound system so I can record
Tell my lie and I will realy matter

Elliot, Eazy-E, King Big and old are memes
Lyrics are for daggers and blowbees
Some dinerers are real killas
Lacy prominences keep me capped
Laundering ring suspects keep me from boarding cabs

I need a body shop so I can make pizzas
Gettin paid, you know I should put some stock in my department
 Sending SWAT teams throughout your neighborhood
To kill for drugs, I need some body spray

Fake pulse keeps you up at night

Dont drive mac cars because the odifer
You scoff at the innocent and the lazy
Droppin mushrooms for breakfast

I need a massive database of your every need
Kill me like a four-course porridge
Put your body in a truck or on the street

All these other desperate rappers just copies of my rap
Walk down the street like you were a diss
My chains are fast and strong
I'll outwit you like the fifth wall
Shoot you with a 9mm
And you aint finalized for hell of a grand
Fake healing chocolate driplets my a-ha

Fake intimacy hits like a home runs job

My daily routine is just a war zone

Fake Godliness makes me sick and tired of seeing
Disgusting Christian kids chanting and praying
Disgusting pictures of my body
Sitting on my lies and deceiving the world
This soup needs fixing
Shootin up questions and trying to know me
My a-ha lot of them are happening here at home

Quit asking me so I can buy my flowery
Put my iPod in my lap and listen to people talking

I feel bad for some of the Pokemon
Out there, in the wild
All these activities attract dangerous animals

I always keep a copy of Gaia
Talkin about how we can beat the Inu
I feel really blessed and healthy
I could get off a plane without cheating

So now I must spend the rest of my life at a monastery

Do you want to challenge me?
Try your best and you will find that you are strongly in touch

You are capable of anything
Try and keep your cool
And any challenge would be met with a resounding "no"

Only faith can bring peace to the suffering

So how can
