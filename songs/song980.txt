Pull out the blimp, spray it to all my rooftops
You live inside a haze like Phil Lord
Drop 50 cents on the kicker

I'm always ready, there's a tat at my door
Tell Im your lifez full of dickheads
Im always perfect
Never worry bouta thing
Keep making measurements
You dupes you a line
We the peoplez a snare
Im a gangbanger your cause the dead look times
Large metal detectors daggers
I own many more murders
 than cold meats
 (Read: pork)
Am I worth a single life?
Sharpen your deductions, you're talking real money
And you realy need not worry, I'll take your hats off to myself

All my robberies are made in the USA

Do you even know that?

I just keep track of where we go
With so much cash I don't even need a receipt

Now I must admit I see a need
Something wrong with my G-d
What would you do if you had to guess greatness
Pray that you were as good as Ransom?
word a thousand
I could get away with murder almost at will

All my burglaries are murders
Got diamond make-up 
Really mean it
Got cars bombs like d7
Got got some meth needles
Mississippi really really really really really good
Money really really really really really really really really really really

Brush em off, I don't need you laughing at me
I need you kidding around

When I pull up with a hundred thousand and God bless him
He that eats me, else I will die a horrible death

And many other sadistic cannibals call the shots

I have so much more to say
Cross your pond no more
Cause there is never a need to be
Call me Jimmy and tell me you can't cut it
Everything you say is real
Talkin bout that room full of Cronenbergs

Hey there guys and gals find out that me and Joker really are fakers

Entry need a body count seriously

We security and law enforcement feed my grill

Infamy is its own soap
Can't live without it
Im tired of all these homeless junkies
gang gang like I was a telephone
Got more money in my back pocket
BANG BANG BANG BANG

I cant think of a better expression than, 'cheapila clipping
pink flannel'

Drip drip drip drip
Drop you with the stendo clip
All my rides is foreign whips
So much ice you almost slip
Droppin bombs like Gaza strip
Got so much ice that I could fill a subway
Quadruple cup cup cup
Takin so much ice I could buy a home
Hang in there some more than a request
Pullin up in that spaceship
Got more than enough fuel for four hundred would-be attackers

I want that phasma signature
I need that nuke variant

Pullin up in that spaceship
Got more than enough electricity to power an entire bus
Pullin up in that spaceship
Got more than enough water to power an entire garage

Pullin up in that spaceship
All these other rappers just doing their thing
Sending rave reviews
Then I saw his face
And I aint never sorry

Cause when you see him doing good
 you ain'thin but a joke

Don't do gamified drugs
They'll really mess you up

Cause crystal meth weaves like sausages
I just got enough to live on
What you really taking is cylindrical

If I was a human being, I would find this complex
Using complicated drugs is a terrible aim

So I'm giving up on trying
This cause could leave a mess in the future

They asking for my horror movie
Or my comedy team
They're all asking for you
Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and thin (LH)
Xanax and molly (help)
I need these all around me
Giving myself over to your
