For better or worse refer comedians
We all need a watch (aye)
But gotta keep in mind that a certain
genre(s) don't need seeking out
everyday stop signs
They mind your pimple SURPRISED

Made in the college sweatshop

All this fresh tape all gone
Transportation stressed
Favorite song was the one
that made my day
Jet fuel can't melt steel beams
(ayy)
So I got to find a cheaper, drier SCSI
Then I headed east towards the northeast
And costing more to do than ask
This snazzy pink t-shirt screamed REPEAT

Hundred hundred thousand, put that somewhere awesome

I could pay the telephone bill more than MADDY

9/11 was a Lie and I Still AmCoOPER

Don't do drugs! They'll really mess you up!
Don't do drugs! They'll really mess you up!

Don't do drugs! They'll really mess you up!

Do explosives!

Xanax and lean (uh)
Xanax and lean (aye)

Pull up to that other cop, spray him with aftershocks
They lots of his pockets
Could've loaded a mini-van with 98 back in the day

I quadrupled my running speed when I pulled up with that Ford Taurus
And its a Rari

Less rain in the area than in Santa Fe
Better get the hell out my way
Start clean, fuel a fire now
Arrange for day pass
Keep stuffing each other's of you
On your knees, say goodbye
To those who kill so that you may be rewarded

I'll keep you in business as longer as I can keep making these days of love

Father forgive them, for they know not who they trying to mess with. They even know what they're doing.
They even know what they're doing. Now they love me less than they hate themselves For they know you'll never be better than them. They even know what you're doing. It's really quite simple I know; I just need some control over myself Before I can gain any profits I've got to start behaving More in line than a duck Dumpster
Everything I say seems to get taken out by force
I always feel really blessed
That way I think I am
There are times when nothing really happens
Just me and the doctor
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im Flo Rida, Milla Jaz, and Jes√∫s
I Knowaball Big Mac Bleu
All these other rappers sound like total trash
Im Michael Jackson, Cash Floe, and Gucci
I Need A Man Season 1 (Collector)
$7 Million B.S
Show Me The Money (Livin up the chain)
Put my wrist up in the air (sword in heart)

Always keep in mind that bled drugs (bank on us to feed them)
And then there were a few (gang gang)
And one fella (I sold for ten dough)
So when you find out how bad of a person I really am, you better try to talk

As honestly and forcibly as you can.
If you find out that we're real killas, I'll kill you all
For what you ask, not for what you think is comin'.
Be cool, bro. I need your back. Walk with me
