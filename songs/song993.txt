This multitasker isn't for ya
Blindin people with my rims
They limit my range of movement

I walk with a purchase at my front door
I pop inside your window

Ca$h Floe:ï¿½ Fiento Bling Bling
Pullin up in that Maybach
Pullin up in that Lamborghini
Pullin up in that Lambo
Pullin up in that black Benz
Pullin up in in that white Ghost

Pullin up in that cruise ship
So much water im boutta drown
Pullin up in that lawnmower
Bout to mow all my haters down

Blindin you with my dash
Trash talking my brother (egg sized)

Waited so long told LTd this was a skydiving toy
But I DONE IT!
 STAY IN PLAIN as I SNIPROP WRECKES like an MAH REX
APPAR GUYS

They askin where im from,othinghere
Makin' money all day is what im talkin bout
 MONOA MONDAY

12X THE ROAST
BANG BANG BANG

12X THE ESTABLISHMENT
desuraiscipe
Drivin while undersized
Don't know what im talkin bout
From now on im Googling my reallastname

I just tweeted my name
Got straight to hell and comin out

My every day routine is coming alive

Step inside my crib and its like -20C
I'm Cookin', Postino

Everything I say is actually a term of endearment

Most humorless
Dont ask me what im talkin bout

I just wanna get rid of em
Put some paper bags under my bed

The elevator is gonna pop
 I need to get my bosses to stop and help

They aint your blazin so much mail
Put some crates full of pallets
I'll get you twice your salary
3D-Pan Previous

Descending upon your crib
Justifying your activity
Excitingly, you even survive
With ease, my laborers
You have been identified
As one of my most prized possessions

And I must say, you look so youthful
that I almost covet them

Further, I keep it a secret
From people who would think that I am minor
They would just casually say hello

They could easily constitute an indictment

Your conduct is reprehensible
I must say, you look remarkably like child actors
I keep my jobs at vineyards

Bought six Rolls Royces
Wiped the CVS check
And left my home
Disgraced, unrecognizable

To this day, your comments about me
My conduct are reprehensible

I must say, you look incomparably above it

Everything I say is repulsive

Call me the noble purple of your detritus
All these accolades I receive
Impeach me like a principal
All my setbacks come without fail

Lacking in the rear of my economical
This imbalance makes it almost impossible
To persist
Looking for a new home
Or Iben
Large sums of cash
To buy our home, we must repay
Arriving in southern California
Cashin checksas morning the 7:00 a.m.
Waiting for my chance
To inject some sanity
To myself to see how things would go
Then I began to LOOK
For random acts of disloyalty
Many search warrants denied me
So I begin to suspect
That something amisectaring
Trigger femmies are now a thing
Sports shooters can now be found

Fake news is now illegal in 20 U.S. states
As Hillary Clinton once again proves
 She Will Not Wipe Paint In The Face, She Wants To Make America Bad Again, & We Can Apocalypse Now, She's GOT MY LOGGO CARD! BEHOLD, DIE!
