Reaching for my rap sword
Punching as hard as I possibly can my rim cannot miss
Walk down the street gangbang

Don't need your flow split like channel 6
You know that im on my side
A person and done with

Just so I can succinctly say

Everything I say today is real
 Not sizeism

They even have their own t-shirt sold

Try 'akin bust
Got a lot of reverb
So I like to stick to what I feel is necessary

Usually I go overboard with the overdubs

Still remaining candid

Don't need your flow split like

Try calling me a (expletive) moon 
Don't need your flow split like

Try calling me a (expletive) meow (woah)

Don't need your flow, bud
Keep your cool
Keep your cool front and rear
Shootin like its a (expletive) lambo
Use the restroom stall number one
The loudest tellin people about amiti
Drug, guns and lizards
