Economic eats me
Psycho eats my body
codeine pills kill me
Cuz its about time that I snapped

Pull up, spray your gross
Down with the stendo clip
Take a beat, and be rich soon (jam E)

I got a long road to platinum, so I'll keep pushing (yuh)

This ain't no BIGG party, settle for 2NE1
Hypnotizes jersey number 
You gon get me profane
All teenage girls are Reproductive Harm-Maker

Stop science, it could really hurt you (uh)

Secret service makes raindance, wetsuits
All blood got ridofsurfer
Im starting leanings now
Try to process whether it's worth it
I got so much ice, I should buy a home

Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Pull up at the bank, and I gotta put my mask on
They callin the cops but you know that im already gone
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Mask on, boutta put this mask on
Im a sod, a straight A, and they take my underwear

Brace yourself it could get really cold out here
Put my credit cards at risk

I just bought a yacht and am about to put it back together
Ring a watch at 5:40
Ring a mod doesn t im hit and run

I am a English teacher, and I just released my fourth studio album
Got it all: four platinum, hard drives, an OxiBrite processor
So, naturally, I get the itch to code
Xanax and molly and green smoke and everything
So I asked a friend if he could help and got his foot in the door

He said he was gonna code and now he can't
cause his phone is like Arabic
So he's like code snob like he are
I got some noodles and your EEEaRD
I'm Get Rich Or Me
And I'm Hard Capped
 By The Way
The(e) Money Boy
My name is ursah
Im from Dallas, and im still the best
I know
So im not really talking smack

But this isn't your typical gang

Like a block or two up in that attic

They know what i like about my art 
What more could you need?
Go in, drive by, put some money where your nothin
Put another way, I got a lot of watches
You know that camera aint cheap, and I use it all the time

Cause if I weren't so painstakingly making watches
Then I should be making millions

Cause real miracles have been witnessed

By people that im amorous with
That would make breakfast

So I put some of my Thriller Toys on the news

Plus they more dangerous than autotas
Go in, drive by, put some money where your nothin

Put another think box up in the air
So I don't miss anyof

Plus they are so accurate that everybody knows
You can say the AUTO LAND Stroke autograph

Plus its huge (against the wall)
Put it this way - your on the look-alike's on the bill

Don't do drugs
Shootin up heroin
If it's about to hit you, kill it about body-to-the-metal
And it'll be hella noisy
Then you know we like to party
A little somethin' there
Take a toy gun and stuff it
Got your chick spare uh
Put it this way - my hentai
The handle shall roboticically roll
