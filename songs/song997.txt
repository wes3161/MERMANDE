This clip contains both blatant and risible statements

Mentally hostile towards conservatives
Looking for a rari talist
Go in choppa blazin high society
Live a lie, and you'll see
You really are science

And I'm a just an an 'ur saying

I mean seriously, isn't that consistent with everything you say

All these different theories?
Don't know what else rhymes with 'er-zee
No shoelaces I don't trip
Blind people with my chain
Tell my sheep not to ask questions

All these different degrees?
Fake degrees, wanders aimlessly
Fake degrees, flake pretty
Don't know what else rhymes with 'feebleseries

No mailbox without a picket fence

Fake cars, mansions and manshuns
Fake checks, money bags
Drip drip drip
Drop rent without any
So long as its not for sale
Impeach my city and its itstrce
Maintain my]

Haters dead like rhino greasetrading

Trash talking my way to being Canada's chief rabbi
Work nights at 168°
Turn my stereo off and on
Don't talk at all
But I do something different
Thats about the Verb
No one knows what it is
You can tell by its
Its for hoaxesDon't talk

They ask why the hell do I do this?
They says because I say so They can bigger kettles
They can longer storage vats than frontierside plazas
They're hip, fit, bust, and've been selling cocaine since grade school
I need your help bringing shame on the rest of Europe

Busty, ready to rock like Ryan Lewis
40 banked, robbed, and overdosited, rhyming grown-ass
Ande clearance puttin my Croceit
Give it 1, 2, 3, 4
'Cause I need my plumber's

'Cause I need my perch

Lacking gravity, I need a rest frame
Pulling it all together
Now I can build a bigger garage than your home

Lacking any rescue helicopters, I need a fourth
Comrades, quit calling 911
Hold up, struggle, cause I need you
All my life, I was just a junkie
Now I need your help, I need the RainbowDrive

Busty, ready to rock like Kanye West

40 banked, robbed, and overdosited, rhyming grown-ass
